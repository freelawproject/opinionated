Before the Court is the Federal Defendants' Memorandum of Law in Support of their Motion to Dismiss (\n   <strong>\n    d.e. 13\n   </strong>\n   ) filed on May 19, 2017, arguing plaintiff's claims should be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and for failing to state a claim, and Twum-Baah's Opposition Memorandum to Defendants' Motion to Dismiss (d.e. 18) filed on August 4, 2017. For the reasons set forth below, the Federal defendants' motion is GRANTED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Twum-Baah is a representative of the Waroyal Ministry who took his congregation to El Yunque as part of their worship. Together with his wife Selene Cardenas, he also started the tourism company Yotumba Tours, which offered guided tours in El Yunque.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In his amended complaint, Twum-Baah alleges that the Federal defendants conspired with the Tourism Company of Puerto Rico to persecute him for assembling his congregation to worship within El Yunque and/or provide tours in his capacity as a guide for Yotumba Tours. As part of this supposed conspiracy, Twum-Baah lists confrontations he had with the aforementioned USDA officials from April 2015 to April 2016. Although Twum-Baah asserts that the Federal defendants initiated these encounters without probable cause, the Federal defendants issued violation notices against him for infringing certain National Forest System regulations listed in 36 C.F.R. 261.10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Federal defendants understood that plaintiff used the premise of El Yunque without obtaining a special use authorization as required under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=36%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20251.50\">\n    36 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 251.50\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), 261.10(k). Aggrieved by what he considered to be a governmental campaign against him, Twum-Baah filed an administrative complaint of discrimination with the USDA Office of the Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights on February 28,\n   2016. Twum-Baah went through great lengths to provide detailed accounts of his encounters with the Federal defendants, but the Office dismissed his complaint because Twum-Baah concurrently filed identical claims in previous suits before this Court. Believing he had exhausted his administrative remedies, Twum-Baah commenced the instant suit on August 15, 2016 for alleged violations of his constitutional rights under the 1st Amendment and for claims sounding in tort. On May 19, 2017, the Federal defendants moved to dismiss the complaint, arguing that the United States has not waived its immunity for 1st Amendment claims, that Twum-Baah has not fulfilled the administrative requirements to bring some of his tort claims under the FTCA, that the statute of limitations had run on others, and that he had failed to state a claim for harassment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Twum-Baah filed a Motion to Amend his Complaint (\n   <strong>\n    d.e. 19\n   </strong>\n   ) on August 4, 2017, which is GRANTED, the tendered amended complaint is authorized. It elaborates on the formation of the alleged governmental conspiracy, clarifies his claims are mostly based in tort, expounds on the damages he suffered, and arguably adds a claim of racial or ethnic discrimination. Since the amended complaint was filed three months after the motion to dismiss, the Federal defendants did not address the last of these potential claims. But because the rest of the claims in the amended complaint are identical to those asserted in the original complaint, the Court has considered the Federal defendants' arguments for dismissal in its analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    RELEVANT LEGAL STANDARDS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    I.
