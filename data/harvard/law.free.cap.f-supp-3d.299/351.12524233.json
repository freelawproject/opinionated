Gazco's ADEA and Title VII discrimination claims, as well as supplemental claims under Article 1802, are dismissed with prejudice.

And given that the parties have submitted ninety-one exhibits, Local Rule 56 compliance is even more important than usual to facilitate the Court's administration of justice. The Rule intends to protect the Court from having to ferret through exhibits to determine if a genuine issue of material fact exists. Hence, considering Gazco's noncompliance and the importance of Local Rule 56 in the context of ninety-one exhibits, the Court will disregard Gazco's opposing statement of facts. Defendants' submission shall be deemed admitted as uncontroverted to the extent it complies with Local Rule 56.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Relevant Factual and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Mar\u00eda Gazco is a female, Seventh Day Adventist, over forty years of age, who began working for the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) as a Transportation Security Officer in 2002. (Docket No. 65 \u00b6\u00b6 1, 6). As of filing this case, she worked as a Master Behavior Detection Officer at the F-Band level (BDO).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3. Because of her religion, she took Saturdays as a \"Regular Day Off,\" and the TSA has always granted her requests to do so.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7. Throughout her employment, the TSA had non-discrimination and anti-harassment policies that Gazco was familiar with.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 4-5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    Job Promotion Interviews\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The TSA's administration guide defines the policies and procedures for interviewing and selecting BDOs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9. According to the guide, candidates are interviewed by a panel of two or three trained interviewers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10. The process consists of standard\n   question and scoring procedures, in which candidates are asked identical questions and rated on a five point scale by each interviewer.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The interviewers then discuss their ratings among themselves to agree on an overall rating for each competency.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11. Candidates who score three points or more in each competency \"pass\" the interview.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12. Per the guide, those who pass make it to a BDO Selection Referral List, and a selecting official then chooses from any of the candidates in that list.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In 2008, a G-Band BDO position, a promotion from Gazco's F-Band BDO position, became available.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15. Gazco, however, skipped the opportunity to interview.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16. She was not selected, and did not file an Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) discrimination charge for her non-selection.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In 2010, another G-Band BDO position became available.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18. Gazco interviewed before a three-member panel, scored two points in the \"Problem Solving Competency\" and thus did not make the Selection Referral List.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 20-22. Overall, she scored fourteen points, and the prevailing candidate scored twenty-three.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21, 23. The Selecting Officer decided based on interview notes and scoring sheets that did not indicate the candidates' name, sex, religion, age, or EEO activity.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29. Gazco did not file a discrimination charge with the EEO as a result of her non-selection.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Another G-Band vacancy emerged in or around November 2011, and Gazco interviewed for it on January 9, 2012. (Docket No. 65 \u00b6\u00b6 32-33). This time she scored twenty-one points, but the prevailing candidate scored twenty-six.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 34-35. In fact, two candidates tied with twenty-six points, and the Selecting Officer broke the tie by considering both candidates' Performance Accountability and Standards System (PASS) Score.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36. Like prior interviews, the panel asked identical questions, tallied scores and reached a consensus for each candidate, did not require Wednesdays and Thursdays off, and did not factor religion, age, or EEO activity.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 37-38. Moreover, Gazco does not claim that she was more qualified than the prevailing candidate.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Gazco applied for another G-Band BDO vacancy in January 2014.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 46. After undergoing the same interview process as before, the TSA filled the first three vacancies with candidates who scored thirty-eight, thirty-seven, and thirty-seven points each.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 47-50. Gazco scored thirty-six points, and tied with three other candidates.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 51. To break the tie, the Selecting Officer considered the candidates' 2013 performance evaluation scores.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Gazco finished second.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On February 14, 2014, she was notified of her rejection.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 52. As to one of the prevailing candidates, Gazco alludes to her personal views of her conduct in 2011 as proof that she was not qualified.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 53.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Finally, in June 2014, Gazco was appointed to a G-Band BDO vacancy while a co-worker took military leave.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 54. She was paid at the G-Band BDO rate and her accommodation to observe the Sabbath was honored.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    Alleged Religious Discrimination\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On or around July 30, 2011, someone traced crosses with liquid on the walls, cubicles, and desks of the BDO office. (Docket No. 65 \u00b6 55). Gazco admitted that the incident affected everyone in the office because all of the eight cubicles, which were shared by twenty-seven employees, were marked by crosses.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 57, 59. After an investigation, two employees admitted that they conducted a private prayer ceremony in the BDO office, which consisted of reading scripture, praying, and anointing the walls with holy water.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 61. One of them explained that there was\n   no premeditation or hidden purpose behind their religious practice.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In response, one of the employees received a Letter of Counseling explaining that the religious act had unintended consequences and that other employees found it disrespectful and offensive.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 62. After this incident, no other incident of this sort has happened again.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 63.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    Alleged Sexual Harassment\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On July 27, 2011, Gazco met with other employees and officers to discuss concerns about BDO Edward Delgado's violation of standard operating procedures.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 64. As Gazco specified Delgado's faults, Delgado became upset and launched his own accusations against her.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 65. Gazco responded by alleging that he had been sexually harassing her for the past two years, until she urged him stop on March 10, 2011.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 65-66.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On August 1, 2011, Gazco met with two superiors and reported the alleged instances of sexual harassment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 67. The TSA issued a management directive and appointed an officer to conduct an internal administrative inquiry regarding Gazco's charges.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 69. In September, TSA launched another investigation into the July 27 meeting.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 70. After interviewing and obtaining written statements from the alleged harasser, Gazco, and several witnesses, both investigators rendered written reports concluding that Gazco's claims were unsubstantiated.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 71-72. None of the interviewed co-workers recalled witnessing any sexual impropriety between Delgado and Gazco.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 72.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On November, 4, 2011, a TSA officer informed Gazco that the investigation yielded no evidence supporting her allegations. (Docket No. 65 \u00b6 73). Nevertheless, he informed Gazco that he had ordered to keep Gazco and Delgado in separate teams to avoid potential discomfort.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 73. An Interoffice Memorandum addressed to Gazco repeated the promise, and told Gazco that she should inform her supervisor if she was ever appointed to work with Delgado.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Since then up to Gazco's deposition in March 12, 2013, Gazco was never placed on the same team as Delgado.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 75.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   According to Gazco, Delgado stopped making sexual remarks to her in March 2011, when she asked him to stop.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 76. She has also admitted that he never touched her.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   However, after stopping the alleged harassment in March, he continued to give her \"dirty looks\" and \"smiles,\" which she characterized as \"sinister lusty.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 77. Moreover, she claims that he sat under the time clock between September 2012 and January 2014, which forced her to see him when she clocked in and out.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 79. According to Gazco's deposition, Delgado would sit under the punch clock with his legs wide open, causing some people to laugh. (Docket No. 65-2 at 22). He did so \"primarily\" when it was Gazco's turn to punch.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Everyone who clocked in and out, not just Gazco, saw him.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    TSA Admonishments\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In November 2011, a TSA superior appointed another official to investigate possible TSA violations by Gazco.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 81. After a fact-finding inquiry involving interviews of multiple co-workers, Gazco received a Letter of Reprimand for failing to exercise courtesy and tact with fellow co-workers and inappropriate conduct that violated TSA policies and regulations. (Docket No. 65 \u00b6\u00b6 82-83). The letter was hand-delivered on December 14, 2011.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 83.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Pursuant to an order by TSA management, who was concerned about her capabilities and behavior, Gazco underwent a mental evaluation for a fitness for duty report in February 2012. (Docket No. 65 \u00b6 84). The report found her medically unfit for the BDO position and informed her\n   that she would not be allowed to report to work.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 85. On April 27, 2012, she was terminated from her employment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 86. A month later she appealed the TSA's decision and was reinstated with full back pay on June 25, 2012.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 87. The Office for Professional Responsibility's Appellate Board noted that that management's decision to remove Gazco was based on reliance in the finding that she suffered from a mental health condition that rendered her disqualified.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 88.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    Contact with the Civil Rights and Liberties Office\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Gazco contacted the Civil Rights and Liberties Office (CRL) on November 8, 2011, four days after learning the results of the sexual harassment investigation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 89. During the EEO counseling process, she alleged discrimination based on sexual harassment, continuing hostile work environment, denial of promotions, and the letter of reprimand.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Subsequently, she filed her formal complaint of discrimination alleging harassment and discrimination based on sex, age, religion, and retaliation on March 5, 2012.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 91. More than a year later, on May 10, 2013, the Administrative Judge dismissed the EEO complaint and remanded the matter to the TSA's CRL for a final administrative decision.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 93. The CRL dismissed her claim; Gazco appealed, and on June 17, 2015, the CRL's decision was affirmed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 95.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Gazco contacted the EEO again on February 18, 2014, after being rejected for the BDO position four days earlier.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 96. She filed another formal EEO complaint on June 3, 2014, restating the same claims as her prior complaint. The repetitive claims were dismissed, but the EEO decided to investigate the allegation that she was denied the opportunity to compete for a G-Band position on January 23, 2014. It also decided to investigate her reassignment to an administrative office after requesting that she perform a Fitness for Duty Evaluation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 97. The complaint was referred to the CRL for a final administrative decision, and on July 5, 2014, the claims were dismissed because she failed to prove the decisions were triggered by discriminatory animus.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 98.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Gazco sued Defendants on September 14, 2015, alleging hostile work environment, discrimination based on gender, religion, and age, retaliation, and supplemental state law claims.

She has offered no proof that the TSA knew or should have known of Delgado's alleged harassment before she reported it in July 2011. Moreover, the Court finds that no reasonable juror could conclude that the TSA did not take prompt and appropriate action upon learning of the alleged harassment in July 2011. Upon learning of her charge, TSA launched two investigations. (Docket No. 65 \u00b6\u00b6 69-70). Two officers interviewed Gazco, Delgado, and potential witnesses.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 71-72. Despite finding that no harassment took place, the TSA ensured that Gazco and Delgado would not work together and asked Gazco to inform them if they did.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 73. For the relevant period, Gazco and Delgado did not work together.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 75. As to the continuing looks, Gazco admits that she did not complain about Delgado's behavior, and she offers no evidence as to whether the TSA knew or should have known of said behavior.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 77. Thus far, it would appear that the TSA is entitled to summary judgment on this matter.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Forrest\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4067287\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/511/225/#p228\">\n    511 F.3d at 232\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding, in the context of ex-lovers, that response was prompt and appropriate when employer had policy prohibiting sexual harassment, trained its managers to take disciplinary action against offenders, and took remedial action against alleged harasser three times, ultimately firing him).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   But the Court must deny summary judgment based on Delgado's behavior at the time clock. Delgado would sit under the punch clock with his legs wide open, causing some people to laugh. (Docket No. 65-2 at 22).

She engaged in protected conduct when she contacted the CRL on November 8, 2011, filed an EEO complaint on March 5, 2012, and filed a second EEO complaint on June 3, 2014. She was subject to an adverse employment action when she received a Letter of Reprimand on December 14, 2011, a notice of proposed removal on March 19, 2012, and when she was not selected for the BDO vacancies in January 2012 and January 2014. As to the third factor, Gazco can establish causation through temporal proximity. There was only one month between her contact with the CRL and her Letter of Reprimand in 2011. Likewise, only two weeks elapsed between her formal EEO complaint and her notice of proposed removal in March, 2012. As to the first BDO vacancy, only two months passed between the CRL contact in 2011 and her rejection in 2012.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mariani-Colon v.

As to the second BDO vacancy, Gazco fails to satisfy the prima facie test because she has not proven a causal connection between protected activity and protected conduct. But because she has met her burden of proof for at least three adverse acts, the Court must proceed to the second and third part of the\n   <em>\n    McDonnell Douglas\n   </em>\n   test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   If a plaintiff successfully establishes the three elements, the burden shifts to the defendant to \"articulate a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for its challenged actions.\"\n   <em>\n    Colon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3576196\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/717/43/#p49\">\n    717 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   49 (citing\n   <em>\n    Provencher v.

It justified the Letter of Reprimand because it was based on a fact-finding inquiry that revealed Gazco failed to exercise tact and courtesy with co-workers. (Docket No. 65 \u00b6\u00b6 82-83). Likewise, the Notice of Proposed Removal stemmed from a mental evaluation and fitness report.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 85. And finally, as discussed earlier in the context of discrimination, the BDO interviews followed a procedure where the TSA promoted candidates who scored higher than Gazco.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Gazco creates an issue of fact as to pretext. On the one hand, she has offered no evidence that would prove that the legitimate business reasons for the Letter of Reprimand and BDO selection were pretextual. But on the other hand, she appealed the TSA's decision to discharge her following the mental fitness report-and won. (Docket No. 65 \u00b6 87). The fact that she was reinstated after her appeal could allow a reasonable juror to infer that the reasons for the notice of removal two weeks after she filed an EEO complaint were pretext for retaliation. It is\n   possible that but-for her complaint, she would not have been discharged. Therefore, Defendants' motion for summary judgment as to Gazco's retaliation claim is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   D.\n   <em>\n    Supplemental Jurisdiction\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Gazco asserts supplemental state law claims only under Article 1802 of the Puerto Rico Civil Code. Article 1802 is Puerto Rico's general tort statute, which provides that a person who \"causes damages to another through fault or negligence\" shall be liable in damages. P.R. L AWS A NN .tit. 31 \u00a7 5141. However, the United States is immune from suit unless it consents otherwise, and it \"has not waived its sovereign immunity for suits under Puerto Rico's laws.\"\n   <em>\n    Velazquez-Rivera v.

Therefore, Gazco cannot sue Defendants in their official capacity under Article 1802.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Moreover, it is well-established that a plaintiff cannot recover under Article 1802 for discrimination and retaliation causes of action. \"To the extent labor legislation has created new causes of action to address previously uncovered aspects of employment relationships as in the case of\n   <em>\n    discrimination and retaliation\n   </em>\n   , it has been subjected to the same remedial exclusivity principle barring redress under general statutes such as Article 1802 of the Civil Code.\"\n   <em>\n    Santana-Colon v.
