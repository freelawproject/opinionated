(ECF No. 43.) Both motions are opposed. Plaintiffs bring their claims based on their purported misclassification as independent contractors. For the following reasons, Defendant's Motion to Dismiss is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   and Plaintiffs' Motion for Conditional Certification of their FLSA Claim is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   subject to conditions outlined within this Opinion and Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiffs David Hall (\"Hall\"), Dustin Bryan (\"Bryan\"), and Nicholas Thompson (\"Thompson\" collectively, \"Plaintiffs\") bring suit under the FLSA on behalf of a purported class of similarly situated individuals. Plaintiffs are former contract delivery drivers for Defendant, U.S. Cargo and Courier Service, LLC (\"U.S. Cargo\"). As a condition of employment all U.S. Cargo drivers are required to sign a form contract entitled \"Independent Contractor Agreement\" (\"Agreement\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Hall worked as a delivery driver for U.S, Cargo from approximately June 20, 2012 to approximately July 24, 2015. (Second Amen. Compl. \u00b6 27.) Over the course of that time period, Hall signed two Agreements, one as an individual and one as an LLC by the name MD Freight. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   28.) Defendant paid Hall a daily flat rate of approximately $179.00 regardless of hours worked, $3.00 per stop, and a $0.75 bonus per piece if he delivered more than three pieces per stop. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29.) While a driver, Hall asserts he regularly worked five days per week for approximately ten to twelve hours per day. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Defendant paid Bryan an unspecified flat daily rate and $3,00 per stop, regardless of how-many hours he worked. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 33.) Bryan asserts that he typically worked five days a week for at least fifty hours per week and often worked up to seventy hours per week.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Thompson worked as a delivery driver for Defendant from July 2013 to September 2014. Defendant paid Thompson a flat daily rate and $3.00 per stop, regardless of the hours he worked. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37.) Thompson asserts he typically worked five days a week for approximately sixty hours per week and up to sixty-seven and one-half hours per week. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   All three named Plaintiffs signed Agreements with U.S. Cargo. In the Agreements, they waived their right to proceed on a class action basis for any disputes arising from the substance of said Agreements. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Exhibits A \u00b6 18, B \u00b6 18, and C \u00b6 18.) The Agreements each state that Plaintiffs agree to \"waive all rights to a jury trial, or certification of a class action\" with regard to disputes arising from the Agreement. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Exhibits A-C.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II. MOTION TO DISMISS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Defendant moves to dismiss Plaintiffs' putative class and collective action claims as contained in the Second Amended Complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) provides for dismissal of actions that fail to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). Such an action will be dismissed where \"there is no law to support the claims made\" or where \"the facts alleged are insufficient to state a claim.\"\n   <em>\n    Stew Farm, Ltd. v. Natural Res.

Specifically, Defendant argues that the class and collective action claims must be dismissed because \"Plaintiffs waived their rights to proceed in a class or collective fashion\" by signing a waiver in the Agreement and because \"Plaintiffs are inadequate representatives of the purported class and collective.\" (Mot. Dismiss at 1, ECF No. 43.) In the most recent contracts, Plaintiffs and U.S. Cargo agreed to the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    Venue\n   </em>\n   : Any dispute or interpretation arising out of or pursuant to this Agreement shall be the subject of a lawsuit filed in Franklin County, Ohio. The Parties expressly agree to subject themselves to personal jurisdiction in any such court, and to accept service of process by certified mail.\n   <strong>\n    The parties further agree to waive all rights to a jury trial, or certification of a class action, in conjunction with any such lawsuit.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   (Exhibit A \u00b6 18, Exhibit B \u00b6 18, Exhibit C \u00b6 1 8 (emphasis added).)

Accordingly, without an arbitration provision or any other \"countervailing federal policy that outweighs the policy articulated in the FLSA,\" any waiver of employees' collective action rights is invalid.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4071547\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/725/603/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Defendant argues\n   <em>\n    Killion\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable from the instant matter for two reasons. (Mot. Dismiss at 11.) First, Defendant asserts that in\n   <em>\n    Killion,\n   </em>\n   the plaintiffs brought only collective claims under the FLSA, but the Plaintiffs here have asserted both a putative FLSA collective action claim and a putative state class action claim. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) This distinction is important, Defendant argues, because \"no Ohio Courts [ ] have held that class waivers under the Ohio Wage Act or the OPPA are unenforceable.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Defendant, however, provides no Ohio cases finding class waivers enforceable either. Moreover, Defendant does not provide reasoning to support its assertion that plaintiffs' claims should be treated distinctly from the\n   <em>\n    Killion\n   </em>\n   plaintiffs' claims because they bring both collective and class action claims. Thus, the Court finds Defendant's attempt to distinguish\n   <em>\n    Killion\n   </em>\n   unpersuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Second, Defendant argues that the\n   <em>\n    Killion\n   </em>\n   plaintiffs signed a release following the termination of their employment as salesmen that \"purported to prevent the\n   <em>\n    Killion\n   </em>\n   plaintiffs from suing their former employer at all,\" while the instant Agreements do not broadly prohibit Plaintiffs from bringing claims in an individual capacity. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The question the Sixth Circuit addressed in\n   <em>\n    Killion\n   </em>\n   , however, was not dependent on the breadth of the contract's prohibition, but that it sought to waive class claims outside of an arbitration agreement.\n   <em>\n    Killion\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4152261\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/761/574/#p592\">\n    761 F.3d at 591\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Indeed, the case Defendant cites to persuade this Court that class waivers are enforceable is outside this circuit and directly disagrees with the\n   <em>\n    Killion\n   </em>\n   decision.\n   <em>\n    Kubischta v. Schlumberger Tech Corp.,\n   </em>\n   Case No. 15-cv-1338,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%203752917\">\n    2016 WL 3752917\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20U.S.%20Dist.%20LEXIS%2091556\">\n    2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 91556\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *23 (W.D. Pa. July 14, 2016) (\"This Court is not persuaded by the reasoning of the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals.\"). It cannot be disputed that this Court is bound by a published decision of the Sixth Circuit. Plaintiffs' class waivers do not contain an arbitration agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Accordingly, following the Sixth Circuit's reasoning, the waivers are unenforceable. Thus, Defendant's Motion to Dismiss is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

The Court agrees with the reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Gomez\n   </em>\n   and similarly does not \"see how this identification offers any useful information to prospective plaintiffs.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20U.S.%20Dist.%20LEXIS%2091778\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Instead, Plaintiffs shall include a statement in the notice reflecting that Defendant is represented by counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    f.

Opp'n Conditional Cert. at 18.) Plaintiffs' proposed notice, however, also includes the statement, \"[t]he Federal Court has not yet decided who will win, and has not taken any position on the merits of the claims. The Federal Court also expresses no opinion as to whether you or anyone else should join the lawsuit.\" (Pls.' Exhibit Y, ECF No. 41-25.) The Court disagrees with Defendant that inclusion of the case heading is misleading and will allow the heading to remain.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Method of delivery\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Plaintiffs request to send notice to the putative class members by email, first class mail, and/or text messaging.
