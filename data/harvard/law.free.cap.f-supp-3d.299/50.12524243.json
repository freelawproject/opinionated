Plaintiff's resume was among \"a package\" of six or seven applicants forwarded to Thomas from the Human Resources department. (June 15, 2017 Oral Dep. of John D. Thomas, P.E., at 17:17-18, 18:3, ECF No. 27-3). Thomas, who was \"ultimately responsible\" for hiring individuals to fill the positions, reviewed Plaintiff's resume but did not select him for an interview.

Thomas avers that both of the positions were \"primarily to manage projects, as opposed to performing engineering tasks and functions.\" (Thomas Decl. \u00b6 3). The primary function of the first position, filled by an African American man, was \"to oversee the installation of canopies over escalators at Metrorail station entrances.\" (\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     ).

(Def.'s Mem. at 9-10). In his opposition, Plaintiff invokes the continuing violation doctrine, the discovery rule, and a \"paycheck accrual\" theory under the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009 (\"LLA\"), Pub.L. No. 111-2,\n      <extracted-citation index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=123%20Stat.%205\">\n       123 Stat. 5\n      </extracted-citation>\n      . (\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      Opp'n at 3). Plaintiff posits that under the LLA, \"the charge filing period resets with each pay check that reflect the pay disparity and does not expire the 180 days after the initial discriminatory pay decision was made.\" (\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      ). But in rejecting an argument for reviving an unpreserved discrimination claim, the D.C. Circuit concluded that \"whether to promote an employee to a higher paying position is not a 'compensation decision or other practice' within the meaning of that phrase in the LLA and [a] failure-to-promote claim is not a claim of 'discrimination in compensation.' \"\n      <em>\n       Schuler v. PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLP\n      </em>\n      ,\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3547139,4216204\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/595/370/\">\n       595 F.3d 370\n      </extracted-citation>\n      , 375 (D.C.

Moreover, as discussed\n      <em>\n       supra\n      </em>\n      at 57-58, Plaintiff's continuing violation theory is inapposite because an employer's failure to promote is a discrete act that requires timely exhaustion of each decision. Finally, Plaintiff's assertion that he \"did not file suit after issuance of the March 15, 2011 right-to-sue letter because he reasonably did not know that he was working under a hostile environment ... from the year 2008 to 2015\" (Opp'n at 2-3) is simply untenable. By definition, a hostile work environment is one so \"permeated with discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult\" and \"sufficiently severe or pervasive\" as \"to alter the conditions of the victim's employment and create an abusive working environment[.]\"\n      <em>\n       Nat'l R.R.

Plaintiff's Work History and Job Applications\n      </strong>\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-11\">\n      Plaintiff worked as a Project Manager in WMATA's engineering services department from August 1999 until his retirement in April 2015, at age 80. Plaintiff alleges that he \"was disappointed by the lack of promotion during [his] 16 years of uninterruptible work for WMATA and tired of the daily long walking from the Eisenhower Metro Station to the office\" in Alexandria, Virginia. As a result, Plaintiff \"felt like\" he was \"forced to retire ... at the same job classification ... and the same grade/pay 14.\" (Am. Compl. \u00b6 2).\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-12\">\n      Plaintiff alleges that over the course of his employment, WMATA denied him \"any promotion and discriminated against [him] in the selection process in about 12 ... engineering job[ ] positions\" for which he had applied. (Am. Compl. \u00b6 3). When he first applied for a position in 2003, Plaintiff \"had graduate level education and a good 25 years of engineering experience, which [were] better than any of the selected candidates' qualification[s].\" (\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      ). In January 2014, Plaintiff \"suffered stress and emotional pain when on or around January 31, 2014,\" he apparently learned that WMATA's hiring manager, Mr. John Thomas, had \"refused to interview [him] to compete for promotion against other candidates for a position in the Construction Department,\" despite the Human Resources Department's alleged assessment of Plaintiff \"as a well-qualified candidate for that engineering position.\" (\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      \u00b6 4, citing Compl. Ex. 1, Thomas's Jan. 31, 2014 Memorandum re: Selection of Project Manager Interviewees). That decision, stemming from events that occurred in November 2013, forms the basis of this action.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-14\">\n      Thomas avers that despite Plaintiff's \"significant experience in electrical engineering tasks in another department at WMATA,\" he \"did not feel that Mr. Oviedo was the right person for either of [the] specialized positions\" since he had \"concentrated primarily on electrical engineering design, which was not the focus of either\" position. (Thomas Decl. \u00b6 4). Plaintiff's resume \"did not indicate [his] familiarity with WMATA processes and procedures,\" which for Thomas was \"a necessity[.]\" (\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      ). Thomas determined that the two individuals who were selected \"had the best combination of leadership ability, breadth of experience, and technical knowledge so as to be the best candidates for the respective positions.\" (\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      ).\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-15\">\n      Plaintiff alleges that \"WMATA Hiring Managers did not promote me and discriminated against me because of several factors: my age (79 years old), my strong Hispanic accent, and also as a way of retaliation\" because he had \"complained twice\" to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\"EEOC\") about WMATA's alleged violations of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended (\"Title VII\"), and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (\"ADEA\"). (Am. Compl. \u00b6 5). Plaintiff also complained to WMATA's Civil Rights Office about alleged violations of the Hiring and Promotion Policy.

Compl. \u00b6 10). Allegedly, each complaint raised \"the same ... argument and content, as they were all related to no promotions due to discrimination,\" which resulted in \"a diminished salary affected by long-past discriminatory decisions.\" (\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      ).\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-18\">\n      Plaintiff alleges that on June 18, 2009, and June 26, 2009, he emailed WMATA's Office of Civil Rights about his \"lack of selection for the Manager of Engineering (job ref # 090035) position and was \"notified\" that the Office \"does not investigate claims unless there is evidence of discrimination.\" (Am. Compl. \u00b6 12(c) ). In November 2009, Plaintiff filed a charge with the EEOC, claiming discrimination based on \"race/national origin (Hispanic-Chilean)\" and age (74). (Charge of Discrimination, ECF No. 27-7). Plaintiff checked the box for \"continuing action\" but listed the earliest date of discrimination as March 13, 2009, and the latest date as September 2, 2009. (\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      ).

Plaintiff claimed specifically that on March 13, 2009, he applied for an open Manager of Engineering position (# 090035) but was not interviewed, and on September 2, 2009, he was interviewed for another Manager Engineering position (# 08064) but was not hired. (\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      ). In each instance, Plaintiff wrote, \"a younger less qualified non-Hispanic American was hired.\" (\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      ) The EEOC issued its Dismissal and Notice of Rights on March 15, 2011, informing Plaintiff,\n      <em>\n       inter alia\n      </em>\n      , of his right to file a lawsuit within 90 days from his receipt of the notice (ECF No. 27-8). Plaintiff did not file a lawsuit.

(Charge of Discrimination, ECF No. 27-5). Plaintiff listed the earliest date of discrimination as January 1, 2013, and the latest date as November 18, 2013, but specifically claimed that on the latter date, WMATA failed to interview him for \"the position of Project Manager.\" (\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      ). Plaintiff did not check the \"continuing action\" box.

Plaintiff claims generally that \"supervisors and staff members\" failed (1) to \"provide an equal opportunity on the job competition,\" (2) to select \"the best candidates,\" (3) to follow \"WMATA Hiring and Promotion practices,\" and (4) to enforce Title VII and the ADEA. Plaintiff alleges that the interviewers allowed their \"personal judgment [to prevail] over the candidate with the best qualifications. (\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      ).

In contrast, Thomas testified that he \"saw\" in Plaintiff's resume \"an extensive list of technical experiences in the electrical engineering area of Metro, both designs as well as review of submittals for electrical engineering,\" which, in his opinion, \"was a very narrow focus of experience at Metro.\" (Thomas Dep. at 22:10-13). When pressed by Plaintiff about the candidates' levels of experience, Thomas insisted that \"it wasn't the length of the experience\" but \"the breadth of the experience\" that formed his opinion. (\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      at 20: 19-20).

Thomas's deposition testimony is consistent with his observations in the January 31, 2014 Memorandum, which contemporaneously memorialized his decision not to interview Plaintiff. Then, as in his deposition, Thomas explained:\n     </p>\n     <p class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-44\">\n      Mr. Oviedo's experience at WMATA has been focused on the technical aspects of the electrical power systems for the operation of the rail system. The Project Manager position requires more than just technical knowledge of WMATA but, as noted above, knowledge of the business aspects of WMATA's policies, procedures and practices. Accordingly, I believed that Mr. Oviedo's experience was too narrowly focused to qualify for the position of Project Manager in MCAP.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-45\">\n      (Ex. 1 to Am. Compl.). The memorandum, as well as Thomas' testimony, reflects a reasoned business decision that courts have no authority to reexamine without evidence of discriminatory or retaliatory animus, which, as discussed next, is absent from this case.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-46\">\n      Plaintiff has produced no evidence from which a reasonable jury could infer that Thomas acted with a discriminatory or retaliatory\n     motive, particularly where it seems that the two never met face-to-face.
