(\"AAN\"), a self-described \"issue-oriented action tank\" that ran nearly $18 million in television advertisements just before the 2010 federal midterm elections. Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington-a watchdog group known as \"CREW\"-contends that AAN's spending on these ads rendered it a \"political committee\" as defined in the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971. And, according to CREW, because AAN did not register as a political committee during the relevant time period, it evaded the Act's recordkeeping and disclosure requirements that apply to those groups.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In 2012, CREW filed an administrative complaint with the Commission to that effect. By an evenly divided vote, the Commission dismissed CREW's complaint because a majority of the Commissioners did not find \"reason to believe\" that AAN violated the Act.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=52%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2030109\">\n    52 U.S.C. \u00a7 30109\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2). Specifically, the three controlling Commissioners concluded that AAN did not qualify as a political committee because it lacked a \"major purpose\" of nominating or electing a candidate for federal office,\n   <em>\n    Buckley v. Valeo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=424%20U.S.%201\">\n    424 U.S. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 79,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=96%20S.%20Ct.%20612\">\n    96 S.Ct. 612\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=46%20L.%20Ed.%202d%20659\">\n    46 L.Ed.2d 659\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1976). This Court in a previous decision held that dismissal \"contrary to law\" because it rested on an erroneous premise regarding\n   <em>\n    Buckley\n   </em>\n   's\"major\n   purpose\" requirement. On remand, the Commission again dismissed CREW's complaint in a deadlocked decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   CREW then filed this suit challenging the Commission's second dismissal as contrary to law. Because the Court finds that the Commission's analysis was inconsistent with the governing statutes, it will grant summary judgment in favor of CREW and remand this matter to the Commission.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Legal Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (\"FECA\"), as substantially amended in 1974, regulates federal elections in two key ways. First, the law sets monetary limits on contributions to political parties and candidates.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=52%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2030116\">\n    52 U.S.C. \u00a7 30116\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Second, it imposes disclosure requirements on entities that spend money for the purpose of influencing elections, even when that spending does not go directly to a candidate's coffers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=52%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2030116\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 30104.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   This case is about FECA's disclosure requirements-specifically, those triggered by spending on political advertisements. In broad terms, these disclosure requirements serve \"three important interests: providing the electorate with relevant information about the candidates and their supporters; deterring actual corruption and discouraging the use of money for improper purposes; and facilitating enforcement of the prohibitions in the Act.\"\n   <em>\n    McConnell v. FEC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8897054\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/540/93/#p121\">\n    540 U.S. 93\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 121,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8897054\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/540/93/#p121\">\n    124 S.Ct. 619\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8897054\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/540/93/#p121\">\n    157 L.Ed.2d 491\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2003) (controlling opinion of Stevens &amp; O'Connor, J.J.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Some of FECA's disclosure requirements are triggered by certain types of communications. For example, an entity that makes \"independent expenditures\"-that is, a communication \"expressly advocating the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=52%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2030101\">\n    52 U.S.C. \u00a7 30101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (17) -of over $250 in a calendar year must file a report with the Commission containing information about itself and its contributors,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=52%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2030101\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 30104(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   FECA also imposes more pervasive disclosure requirements on entities based on their campaign-related spending patterns. As relevant here, \"political committees\"-commonly referred to as \"political action committees\" or \"PACs\"-are subject to extensive, ongoing disclosure requirements. They must appoint a treasurer, keep records with the names and addresses of contributors, and file regular reports during a general election year with accounting information, including the amounts spent on contributions and expenditures.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=52%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2030101\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 30102-04. They must also register with the Federal Election Commission or face penalties.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=52%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2030101\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 30104(a)-(b), 30109(d)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   An entity qualifies as a political committee when it satisfies two separate conditions. The first was imposed by Congress in the text of FECA: the entity must receive or spend more than $1,000 in a calendar year for the purpose of influencing a federal election.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=52%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2030101\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 30101(4)(A), (8)(A)(i), (9)(A)(i).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The second condition was imposed by the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Buckley v. Valeo\n   </em>\n   as a narrowing construction of the statutory definition. Under\n   <em>\n    Buckley\n   </em>\n   , political committees are limited to those \"organizations that are under the control of a candidate or\n   <em>\n    the major purpose of which is the nomination or elec\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    tion of a candidate\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=424%20U.S.%201\">\n    424 U.S. at 79\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=96%20S.%20Ct.%20612\">\n    96 S.Ct. 612\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).

The controlling Commissioners' Statement of Reasons acknowledged that, in light of this Court's decision, it could no longer categorically exclude AAN's electioneering communications from its major-purpose calculation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1767-68. Rather, the Commissioners explained that they would proceed ad-by-ad and weigh several factors in deciding whether each electioneering communication should count toward an election-related major purpose. These factors included (1) the extent to which the ad's language focuses on \"elections, voting, political parties,\" and the like; (2) \"the extent to which the ad focuses on issues important to the group or merely the candidates referenced in the ad\"; (3) the context of the ad (but \"only to the extent necessary ... to understand better the message being conveyed\"); and (4) whether the ad \"contains a call to action and, if so, whether the call relates to the ... issue agenda or, rather, to the election or defeat of federal candidates.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1768.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Before they turned to each ad, the Commissioners explained that all of the ads ran in a time period that-while admittedly near the federal midterm elections-also preceded an anticipated \"lame duck\" congressional session. J.A. 1768-70. During that session, Congress was expected to \"consider several pieces of major legislation, many involving policy issues of great importance to AAN\" like \"Bush-era tax cuts, federal spending, health care, and energy.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1769. And, as the Commission noted, Congress did ultimately convene a lame duck session in December 2010 and considered some of those issues.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1769-70.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \"With that context in mind,\" the controlling Commissioners then evaluated AAN's twenty electioneering communications. J.A. 1770. They concluded that four of the ads indicated an election-related major purpose: those titled \"Bucket,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"New Hampshire,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"Order,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   and \"Extreme.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1779. \"Order\" and \"Extreme,\" for\n   example, sought to criticize two Democratic congressional candidates-Mike Oliverio and Annie Kuster, respectively-by linking them with Nancy Pelosi in unfavorable ways.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1778. As the Commissioners explained, \"[n]either ad contains a call to action, nor do they focus on changing the voting behavior or policy stances of the named individuals.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Thus, in their view, those ads were best understood as aiming to defeat reelection of the named representatives.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   On the other hand, the Commissioners found that AAN's sixteen other electioneering communications did not evince an election-related purpose. Conceding that these ads were critical of the incumbent representatives they identified, the Commissioners focused on the fact that each ad instructed viewers to call the representative and urge him to change his vote on a political issue, if not an actual pending bill.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1770-79. For example, the Commissioners declined to count the cost of an ad titled \"Quit Critz,\" which accused then-Pennsylvania representative Mark Critz of supporting \"the Obama-Pelosi agenda that's left us fourteen trillion in debt.\" J.A. 1770. The ad concluded with an exhortation to \"[t]ell Congressman Critz that Pennsylvania families need tax relief this November, not more government,\" and it superimposed text that instructed viewers to call Representative Critz and tell him to vote \"Yes on H.R. 4746,\" the House tax-cut bill introduced earlier that year.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In evaluating that ad and several similar to it,\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Commissioners explained that the ads' references to \"November\" were \"best understood as a reference to the time period in which the lame-duck session would commence\" instead of a reference to the November midterm election, and that \"the express point of [their] criticism\" was \"to marshal public sentiment to persuade the officeholders to alter their voting stances.\" J.A. 1772.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Combining AAN's spending on the four election-related ads with the $4.1 million it spent on express advocacy yielded a sum of $5.97 million, or 22% of AAN's total spending between mid-2009 and mid-2011. J.A. 1779. The Commissioners ran an alternative calculation by adding the cost of an ad called \"Read This\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   -which they considered issue-focused but close to the line-and by counting AAN's spending over only the most recent year in question (mid-2010 to mid-2011).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Under that approach, \"the amount of spending that indicate[d] a purpose to nominate or elect federal candidates would constitute less than 28% of [AAN's] total spending in that time period.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   As a result, the Commissioners concluded that AAN did not have the requisite major purpose of nominating or electing a candidate, and they therefore\n   voted to dismiss CREW's complaint against AAN.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1779-80.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Soon thereafter, CREW filed a motion for an order to show cause why the FEC's dismissal on remand did not contravene this Court's prior decision. Pls.' Mot. Show Cause, No. 14-cv-1419 (Nov. 14, 2016) (ECF No. 57). The Court denied the motion. Memo. Op. &amp; Order,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   (Apr. 6, 2017) (ECF No. 74). To the extent that CREW's motion relied on\n   <em>\n    new\n   </em>\n   legal arguments-for example, that the Commissioners relied on a misreading of\n   <em>\n    McConnell\n   </em>\n   -the Court explained that those new arguments were \"properly taken up in a separate suit.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5. The Court further found that nothing in the Commissioners' dismissal violated the letter of its prior decision:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   [T]he Court never ordered the FEC to reach a particular result, or to consider any particular ad-or any proportion of electioneering communications-election-related. Instead, the Court directed the FEC to reconsider its decision without \"exclud[ing] from its [major purpose] consideration all non-express advocacy.\" The FEC did just that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6 (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   CREW then filed this suit against the FEC. AAN and AJS again intervened as defendants.

More fundamentally, says CREW, the Commission's dismissal rested on a misinterpretation of\n   <em>\n    Buckley\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    McConnell\n   </em>\n   because it invoked those cases as a reason to\n   <em>\n    exclude\n   </em>\n   electioneering communications from its major purpose analysis.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28-33.

Finally, CREW argues that the Commission's analysis was arbitrary and capricious because it ignored contextual evidence highly relevant to the ads' purpose and instead \"cherry picked information\" in order to \"excus[e] AAN from political reporting.\" Pls.' Mot. Summ. J. at 41.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   As the Court explained in denying CREW's motion for a show-cause order, the controlling Commissioners did not repeat their mistake of drawing a bright line between express and issue advocacy. The Court nevertheless finds legal error in the Commission's approach to analyzing AAN's status as a political committee. While the controlling Commissioners did not categorically refuse to count AAN's electioneering advertisements as indicative of an election-related major purpose, the Commissioners used a multifactor test that started from a blank slate in considering the content of each ad, with no apparent regard for the highly relevant fact that each ad fell cleanly within Congress's definition of an \"electioneering communication.\" In the Court's view, that approach violates the unambiguous directive of Congress-made clear in the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002-that electioneering communications\n   <em>\n    presumptively\n   </em>\n   have an election-related purpose. In turn, to the extent that the Commission considers an entity's spending in assessing its major purpose, it must presumptively treat spending on electioneering ads as indicating a purpose of nominating or electing a candidate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    In FECA and BCRA, Congress Made Clear that Electioneering Ads Presumptively Have a Purpose of Nominating or Electing a Federal Candidate\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   To understand the Court's conclusion, begin with the plain text of FECA. Its definition of \"political committee\" is unambiguously broad: it covers any entity that receives or spends over $1,000 within one calendar year for the purpose of influencing an election. If this is all the Court had to go on-and if it could disregard\n   <em>\n    Buckley\n   </em>\n   's constitutional concerns-it would conclude that AAN is a political committee under the clear terms of FECA, and therefore that the Commission was bound to determine as much.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Akins v.

The question, then, is how the Supreme Court's imposition of the major purpose requirement changes things. Here, the context of\n   <em>\n    Buckley\n   </em>\n   's holding is important. The\n   <em>\n    Buckley\n   </em>\n   Court faced a wide-ranging constitutional challenge to FECA after it was amended in 1974. Before reaching the Act's disclosure requirements, the Court first confronted the Act's $1,000 annual limit on expenditures \"relative to a clearly identified candidate during a calendar year.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=424%20U.S.%201\">\n    424 U.S. at 39\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=96%20S.%20Ct.%20612\">\n    96 S.Ct. 612\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court attempted to narrow this language to avoid vagueness problems under the First Amendment by construing it \"to apply only to expenditures for communications that in express terms advocate the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate for federal office.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 44,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=96%20S.%20Ct.%20612\">\n    96 S.Ct. 612\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Even with that narrowing construction, however, the Court found the provision invalid because the government's purported interest \"in preventing corruption and the appearance of corruption\" did not support such a broad speech restriction.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 45,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=96%20S.%20Ct.%20612\">\n    96 S.Ct. 612\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   By contrast, the Court upheld several of FECA's disclosure requirements. But it imposed narrowing constructions on those requirements to avoid problems of vagueness and overbreadth under the First Amendment. For the disclosure requirements triggered by independent expenditures, the Court worried that the Act's definition of \"expenditure\"-which required only a purpose of \"influencing\" an election or nomination-could be read to cover \"both issue discussion and advocacy of a political result.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 79,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=96%20S.%20Ct.%20612\">\n    96 S.Ct. 612\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . So \"[t]o insure that the reach of the [provision] is not impermissibly broad,\" the Court construed the term \"expenditure\" \"to reach only funds used for communications that expressly advocate the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 80,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=96%20S.%20Ct.%20612\">\n    96 S.Ct. 612\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This meant that, to trigger the Act's disclosure requirements, a communication would need to contain \"express words of advocacy of election or defeat, such as 'vote for,' 'elect,' 'support,' 'cast your ballot for,' 'Smith for Congress,' 'vote against,' 'defeat,' [or] 'reject,' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 44,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=96%20S.%20Ct.%20612\">\n    96 S.Ct. 612\n   </extracted-citation>\n   n.52 ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=96%20S.%20Ct.%20612\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 80 &amp; n.108,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=96%20S.%20Ct.%20612\">\n    96 S.Ct. 612\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

As the Court explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   The general requirement that \"political committees\" and candidates disclose their expenditures could raise similar vagueness problems, for \"political committee\" is defined only in terms of amount of annual \"contributions\" and\n   \"expenditures,\" and could be interpreted to reach groups engaged purely in issue discussion. The lower courts have construed the words \"political committee\" more narrowly. To fulfill the purposes of the Act they need only encompass organizations that are under the control of a candidate or the major purpose of which is the nomination or election of a candidate.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=424%20U.S.%201\">\n    424 U.S. at 79\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=96%20S.%20Ct.%20612\">\n    96 S.Ct. 612\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, the \"major purpose\" requirement was born.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Absent any congressional action in the decades since\n   <em>\n    Buckley\n   </em>\n   , this Court might find it unclear whether ads (1) mentioning candidates and (2) airing near elections but (3) not using\n   <em>\n    Buckley\n   </em>\n   's\"magic words\" should count toward an election-related major purpose. But in passing the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (\"BCRA\"), Congress unambiguously expressed its will on this issue and foreclosed the approach that the Commission took here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   In BCRA, Congress sought to mitigate two perceived problems with federal election financing that were prompted (at least in part) by\n   <em>\n    Buckley\n   </em>\n   . Title I of the Act was \"Congress' effort to plug the soft-money loophole\"-that is, the ability to have money contributed to state and local political parties effectively channeled to national parties while evading FECA's contribution limits and disclosure requirements.\n   <em>\n    McConnell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8897054\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/540/93/#p121\">\n    540 U.S. at 133\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8897054\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/540/93/#p121\">\n    124 S.Ct. 619\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In rejecting a facial challenge to BCRA's electioneering restrictions,\n   <em>\n    McConnell\n   </em>\n   recognized that some ads falling within BCRA's definition of \"electioneering advertisements\" may not have a true \"electioneering purpose,\" even if \"the vast majority of ads clearly had such a purpose.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8897054\" index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/540/93/#p121\">\n    540 U.S. at 206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8897054\" index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/540/93/#p121\">\n    124 S.Ct. 619\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The precise percentage of issue ads that clearly identified a candidate and were aired during those relatively brief preelection timespans but had no electioneering purpose is a matter of dispute between the parties and among the judges on the District Court [below].\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   In other words, Congress seems to have left open a small interpretive gap after BCRA: one that allows the Commission, using its case-by-case approach, to deem an extraordinary \"electioneering communication\" as lacking an election-related purpose. The following ad, for example, would seem to fall within the letter of BCRA's definition: It runs 60 days before a midterm election; it does not mention the election or even indirectly reference it (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , by cabining the message's timeframe to \"this November\"); the meat of the ad discusses the substance of a proposed bill; the ad urges the viewer to call a named incumbent representative and request that she vote for the bill; but it does not make any reference to the incumbent's prior voting history or otherwise criticize her.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=52%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2030104\">\n    52 U.S.C. \u00a7 30104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f)(3)(A). That might be the sort of electioneering communication that could, under the Commission's case-by-case approach, properly be deemed lacking an election-related purpose under\n   <em>\n    Buckley\n   </em>\n   despite meeting BCRA's definition of \"electioneering communication.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   But the Court expects such an ad to be a rare exception. Congress has made a judgment that run-of-the-mill electioneering communications have the purpose of influencing an election; an ad meeting the statutory definition of an electioneering communication generally indicates a purpose of nominating or electing a candidate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    The Commission's Analysis Did Not Give Effect to Congress's Clear Intent\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The controlling Commissioners' multifactor analysis ignores Congress's expressed\n   intent regarding electioneering advertisements. The very first sentence of their multifactor test speaks volumes: \"In evaluating major purpose, our starting point is the language of the communication itself.\" J.A. 1767. Starting with the language of a political ad might be justifiable if the ad aired nowhere near a federal election, or if it did not mention a candidate. But, as just explained, when it comes to electioneering communications Congress has already determined that they are presumptively designed to influence elections. The remainder of the Commission's test in no way accounts for that fact:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   [W]e look at the ad's specific language for references to candidacies, elections, voting, political parties, or other indicia that the costs of the ad should be counted towards a determination that the organization's major purpose is to nominate or elect candidates. We also examine the extent to which the ad focuses on issues important to the group or merely on the candidates referenced in the ad. Additionally, we consider information beyond the content of the ad only to the extent necessary to provide context to understand better the message being conveyed. Finally, we ascertain whether the communication contains a call to action and, if so, whether the call relates to the speaker's issue agenda or, rather, to the election or defeat of federal candidates.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   J.A. 1767-68. The Commission may be permitted to use these or similar factors in assessing whether an electioneering ad\n   <em>\n    overcomes\n   </em>\n   the presumption that it is aimed to elect a candidate. But engaging in a holistic,\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review of the ad based on those factors allows the Commission to treat run-of-the-mill electioneering ads-those highly critical of a candidate's positions but lacking the \"magic words\" directing viewers to vote him out of office-as not indicating an electioneering purpose. That framework cannot be squared with Congress's views on the issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Indeed, the controlling Commissioners' analysis of AAN's ads in this case is strong evidence that their multifactor approach, if anything, builds in a presumption that runs in the\n   <em>\n    opposite\n   </em>\n   direction of what Congress intended-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , that it tilts the balance in favor of finding that electioneering communications do\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   have an electioneering purpose. Take the ad titled \"Skype,\" which identified Congresswoman Dina Titus, a Democrat from Nevada who was narrowly defeated in her 2010 reelection bid:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   Person l: Hey, what's up?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   Person 2: Hey. You have to check out the article I just sent you.

I mean, Viagra for rapists? With my tax dollars? And Congresswoman Titus voted for it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   Person 1: Titus voted for it?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   Person 2: Yep. I mean, what is going on in Washington?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   Person 1: In November, we need to tell Titus to repeal it. [Superimposed text: \"Tell Congresswoman Titus to vote for repeal in November. Vote Yes on H.R. 4903. (202) 225-3252.\"]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   J.A. 1776.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The controlling Commissioners did not find that this ad (nor any others mentioning healthcare) had an election-related purpose. \"The criticisms contained in the ads,\" they explained, \"are couched in terms of past votes taken by the named officeholder and are accompanied by calls to action designed to influence the officeholders' votes in the lame-duck session.\" J.A. 1776. Seriously? Is it really plausible that the attack on Titus's past vote for the Affordable Care Act-for supplying \"Viagra\n   to rapists\" no less-was designed to mobilize Titus's constituents to change her view on the Obama Administration's signature legislative initiative, rather than to oust her from office for casting that vote? And would a sophisticated organization like AAN conceivably invest millions of dollars on ads in an effort to get the Democratic-controlled House that had just passed the Act to turn around and repeal it only months later? Perhaps the ad could be charitably read as having a dual purpose-maybe some viewers would indeed be motivated to call Titus and tell her to vote for a healthcare repeal bill if it came up in the anticipated lame-duck session. (That turned out to be a big \"if\"-the Commission cites no evidence, and the Court is aware of none, that the House actually considered a repeal bill during the December lame-duck session.) But surely the primary purpose of this ad was to convince viewers to vote against Titus. Indeed, the ad is awfully close to the hypothetical posed by the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    McConnell\n   </em>\n   to highlight the illusory distinction between express advocacy and issue advocacy: An ad that, instead of urging viewers to \"vote against Jane Doe,\" \"condemned Jane Doe's record on a particular issue before exhorting viewers to 'call Jane Doe and tell her what you think.' \"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8897054\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/540/93/#p121\">\n    540 U.S. at 127\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8897054\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/540/93/#p121\">\n    124 S.Ct. 619\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1944964\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/251/176/#p304\">\n    251 F.Supp.2d 176\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 304 (D.D.C. 2003) (Henderson, J., concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part) ). That the Commissioners readily characterized \"Skype\" and similar ads as unrelated to elections demonstrates the mismatch between their framework and Congress's understanding of electioneering ads. Their approach in fact flirts with a\n   <em>\n    reverse\n   </em>\n   \"magic words\" test: electioneering communications that harangue a candidate are exempt so long as they instruct the viewer to \"call\" her representative rather than to \"vote against\" him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   None of the Commission's arguments in favor of its approach are availing. As it did when justifying its first dismissal, the Commission cites\n   <em>\n    WRTL II\n   </em>\n   , which (again) found that\n   <em>\n    spending\n   </em>\n   on electioneering communications could be restricted only if the ads were, as an objective matter, \"the functional equivalent of express advocacy,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 469,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3573504\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/551/449/\">\n    127 S.Ct. 2652\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Relying on that case, the Commission insists that even if it may not apply a categorical rule that turns on whether the ad contains express advocacy (or the functional equivalent), it may\n   <em>\n    consider\n   </em>\n   whether the ad resembles express advocacy in deciding whether it has an election-related purpose. FEC's Mot. Summ.

That's true so far as it goes: the Commission is not outright forbidden from considering the content of an electioneering communication.

In other words, the Supreme Court has seen no problem with disclosure requirements triggered solely by an electioneering communication's context: its timing, its reference to a candidate, and its viewership.

After BCRA, the Commission cannot review electioneering communications\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   to determine whether they qualify as pure issue discussion. The statute emphatically placed electioneering advertisements on the election-related side of\n   <em>\n    Buckley\n   </em>\n   's line, and the Commission must pay heed to that placement when evaluating the major purpose of an entity that spends money on electioneering communications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Finally, the Commission emphasizes this Court's prior refusal to impose a bright-line rule-one that would require it to count all electioneering communications toward an election-related major purpose. According to the Commission, that refusal implicitly endorsed its approach to electioneering communications. FEC's Mot. Summ. J. at 36. Not so. To be sure, the Court continues to believe that an inflexible rule would be incompatible with the FEC's recognized power to resolve major-purpose questions on a case-by-case basis. Such a rule would also conflict with the Supreme Court's recognition in\n   <em>\n    McConnell\n   </em>\n   that some \"issue ads\" might really be just that, even if run near elections. That does not mean, though, that the Commission has unfettered discretion to judge electioneering ads. Rather, FECA and BCRA make clear that Congress intended to foreclose the Commission from applying a major-purpose framework that does not, at a minimum, presumptively consider spending on electioneering ads as indicating an election-related major purpose.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Commission may in special circumstances conclude that an electioneering ad does not have such a purpose.

Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   The Court recognizes that the Commission, like all executive agencies, must comply with directives from the two other branches of government-directives that sometimes push the agency in opposite directions. The problem here is that the FEC has equated two directives that are plainly unequal in their relevance to the issue at hand. Congress decades ago laid down a clear, broad definition of the term \"political committee\" in FECA that would obviously capture AAN; the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Buckley\n   </em>\n   then cabined that definition in a way that requires the Commission to conduct a major purpose analysis. But Congress later clarified, through BCRA, that it viewed the vast majority of electioneering communications as corroborating a purpose of electing candidates to federal office. And while the Supreme Court in several cases has struck down\n   <em>\n    other\n   </em>\n   aspects of FECA and BCRA, it has never suggested that its constitutional concerns apply in the realm of disclosure requirements. Indeed, the Supreme Court has now twice reaffirmed that there is no constitutional distinction between issue-based and express advocacy in the disclosure context. Absent such a distinction, FECA and BCRA require the agency to presume that spending on electioneering communications contributes to a \"major purpose\" of nominating or electing a candidate for federal office, and, in turn, to presume that such spending supports designating an entity as a \"political committee\" under FECA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Because the Commission failed to apply those presumptions, its dismissal of CREW's complaints against AAN was \"contrary to law.\" The Court, accordingly, will grant CREW's motion for summary judgment, deny the FEC's and AAN's cross-motions, and direct the Commission to conform with this declaration within 30 days.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=52%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2030109\">\n    52 U.S.C. \u00a7 30109\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(8)(C).
