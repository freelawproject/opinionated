Wright, United States District Judge\n   This lawsuit arises from a dispute over the release of recordings of musical performances by Prince Rogers Nelson (Prince) that were not released during his lifetime. On May 22, 2017, the Court issued an Order enjoining Defendants from distributing the disputed recordings while this lawsuit is pending. Two motions are now before the Court. Defendants move to dismiss several counts of Plaintiffs' Amended Complaint. (Dkt. 70.) Plaintiffs move for an order to show cause for civil contempt, asserting that Defendants have failed to comply with the Court's May 22, 2017 Order in certain material respects. (Dkt. 88.) For the reasons addressed below, Defendants' motion to dismiss is granted in part and denied in part, and Plaintiffs' motion for an order to show cause for civil contempt is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This lawsuit pertains to previously unreleased recordings of the internationally renowned recording artist Prince, who died in April 2016. Plaintiffs Paisley Park Enterprises, Inc., and Comerica Bank &amp; Trust, N.A., as Personal Representative of the Estate of Prince Rogers Nelson, allege that Defendants George Ian Boxill, Rogue Music Alliance, LLC (RMA), and Deliverance, LLC (Deliverance), unlawfully possess and have attempted to commercially exploit several sound recordings of Prince.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Boxill is a sound engineer who worked with Prince during Prince's lifetime. In 2004, Boxill executed a Confidentiality Agreement with Paisley Park Enterprises. The Confidentiality Agreement provides that recordings and other physical materials that resulted from Boxill's work with Prince \"shall remain Paisley's sole and exclusive property, shall not be used by [Boxill] in any way whatsoever, and shall be returned to Paisley immediately upon request.\" The Confidentiality Agreement provides that the term \"Paisley\" includes \"Paisley Park Enterprises and all its affiliated and related entities, and the confidentiality obligations to 'Paisley' hereunder shall extend and apply equally to any information or material of any kind concerning Prince Rogers Nelson or any of his family members, agents, business managers, and other representatives.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In 2006, Boxill recorded Prince's performances that comprise the five songs at issue in this lawsuit: \"Deliverance,\" \"No One Else,\" \"I Am,\" \"Touch Me,\" and \"Sunrise Sunset\" (collectively, the \"Prince Recordings\"). Plaintiffs assert that they own copyrights in the Prince Recordings, and Plaintiffs filed applications to register those copyrights in April 2017. Paisley Park Enterprises also owns the trademark PRINCE\u00ae for use in connection with \"phonograph records, audiotapes, compact\n   discs, and videotapes embodying musical performances.\" In April 2017, Defendants began distributing the Prince Recordings through the website www.princerogersnelson.com, using the name \"Prince\" to promote and sell the Prince Recordings via the website.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Based on these allegations, Plaintiffs commenced this lawsuit and sought a temporary restraining order. Plaintiffs' Amended Complaint asserts fourteen counts against Defendants. Count One seeks permanent injunctive relief against all Defendants. Count Two asserts a breach-of-contract claim against Boxill for his alleged violations of the Confidentiality Agreement. Counts Three and Four assert conversion and replevin claims against all Defendants, alleging that Defendants wrongfully possess the Prince Recordings and demanding their return. Count Five alleges that Boxill is liable for damages resulting from theft of the Prince Recordings. Count Six alleges that all Defendants have misappropriated Plaintiffs' trade secrets by providing copies of the Prince Recordings to third parties. Count Seven alleges that RMA and Deliverance tortuously interfered with the Confidentiality Agreement between Boxill and Paisley Park Enterprises. Count Eight asserts a copyright-infringement claim against all Defendants. Counts Nine and Ten assert trademark-infringement claims against RMA and Deliverance. Count Eleven alleges that RMA and Deliverance violated the Minnesota Deceptive Trade Practices Act, Minn. Stat. \u00a7 325D.44 (2016). Count Twelve asserts that RMA and Deliverance violated Prince's common-law right of publicity. Count Thirteen alleges cybersquatting against RMA. Finally, Count Fourteen seeks a declaratory judgment that Prince is the sole author of the Prince Recordings and Boxill has no right to produce or distribute derivative works.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiffs sought a preliminary injunction to prevent Defendants from distributing the Prince Recordings. On May 22, 2017, this Court issued an Order enjoining Defendants from \"publish[ing] or otherwise disseminat[ing] any unreleased recordings that comprise the work of Prince Rogers Nelson that are alleged to be within the scope of the Confidentiality Agreement.\" The Order also requires Defendants to \"deliver all recordings acquired through Boxill's work with Paisley Park Enterprises, Inc., including original recordings, analog and digital copies, and any derivative works,\" to Plaintiffs' counsel for use in this litigation. Finally, the Order requires Defendants to \"cease the use of the trademark PRINCE\u00ae in connection with the promotion, sale, and distribution of the song 'Deliverance.' \"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Defendants now move to dismiss the Amended Complaint for lack of personal jurisdiction or, alternatively, to dismiss certain claims for failure to state a claim on which relief can be granted. Plaintiffs move for an order to show cause for civil contempt, in which they assert that Defendants have failed to comply with the Court's May 22, 2017 Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Defendants' Motion to Dismiss\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Defendants' motion to dismiss asserts that Plaintiffs' right-of-publicity, breach-of-contract, conversion, theft, tortious-interference-with-contract, copyright-infringement, and trademark-infringement claims all fail to state a claim on which relief can be granted. Defendants also contend that this lawsuit must be dismissed because the\n   Court lacks personal jurisdiction over the Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Personal Jurisdiction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Court first addresses the contention of Defendants, who are not residents of Minnesota, that the Court lacks personal jurisdiction over them. If the Court lacks jurisdiction, the Amended Complaint must be dismissed and Defendants' remaining arguments are moot. The parties contest whether Plaintiffs have alleged sufficient facts to establish personal jurisdiction over Defendants in Minnesota. Plaintiffs maintain that Defendants waived their challenge to personal jurisdiction by failing to raise it in response to Plaintiffs' motions for a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction. Alternatively, Plaintiffs argue that each Defendant is subject to specific personal jurisdiction in Minnesota.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   If a party fails to challenge personal jurisdiction in a Rule 12 motion or responsive pleading, the defense is waived. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(h)(1) ;\n   <em>\n    Yeldell v. Tutt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10535127\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/913/533/#p539\">\n    913 F.2d 533\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 539 (8th Cir. 1990). But the parties' dispute regarding waiver need not be resolved because, even if properly challenged, personal jurisdiction exists here. When personal jurisdiction is challenged, a plaintiff must plead facts sufficient to \"support a reasonable inference that the defendant can be subjected to jurisdiction within the state.\"\n   <em>\n    K-V Pharm.

This legal standard requires an act by which the defendant purposely avails itself of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum state so as to invoke the benefits and protections of the forum state's laws.\n   <em>\n    Fastpath, Inc. v.

This Court employs the following five factors to determine the sufficiency of a nonresident defendant's contacts with the forum state: (1) the nature and quality of contacts with the forum state, (2) the quantity of contacts, (3) the relation of the cause of action to the contacts, (4) the interest of the forum state in providing a forum for its residents, and (5) the convenience of the parties.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4148796\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/760/816/#p821\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Defendants are not residents of Minnesota. Although Boxill argues that he has neither performed work in Minnesota nor had any other contacts with the state since 2008, the allegations against him in this lawsuit arise from both the work that he performed in Minnesota and the Confidentiality\n   Agreement that he signed here. Minnesota has an interest in providing a forum for its residents who become embroiled in disputes with consultants they have hired to perform work in Minnesota. Clearly, the allegations in the Amended Complaint establish sufficient minimum contacts to exercise personal jurisdiction over Boxill.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The minimum-contacts analysis for RMA and Deliverance is more complex. Neither RMA nor Deliverance has a presence in Minnesota, and neither conducts business in Minnesota. But Plaintiffs argue that the commercial Internet activity of RMA and Deliverance makes them subject to suit in Minnesota.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Johnson v. Arden\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3706350\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/614/785/#p796\">\n    614 F.3d 785\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 796 (8th Cir. 2010) (citing\n   <em>\n    Zippo Mfg.

Pa. 1997) ). The\n   <em>\n    Zippo\n   </em>\n   test requires courts to examine the \"nature and quality of a defendant's presence on the Internet\" to determine whether minimum contacts with the forum state are established.\n   <em>\n    Minn.

When they did so, RMA and Deliverance knew or should have known that, even after his death, Prince is particularly popular in his home state of Minnesota and that his Minnesota fans would comprise a strong market for the Prince Recordings. These facts establish that Defendants' commercial conduct through the website was directed, at least in part, at the state of Minnesota. Under the\n   <em>\n    Zippo\n   </em>\n   test, the Court has personal jurisdiction over RMA and Deliverance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   RMA and Deliverance also are subject to personal jurisdiction in Minnesota on alternative grounds. Under the effects test articulated in\n   <em>\n    Calder v. Jones\n   </em>\n   , jurisdiction is proper in the state where the effect of the defendant's tortious conduct is felt.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11337451\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/465/783/#p789\">\n    465 U.S. 783\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 789-90,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11337451\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/465/783/#p789\">\n    104 S.Ct. 1482\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11337451\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/465/783/#p789\">\n    79 L.Ed.2d 804\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1984). Plaintiffs allege that RMA and Deliverance have interfered with the Confidentiality Agreement and deprived Plaintiffs of their property interest in the Prince Recordings. Under these allegations, a diminution in value of Prince's estate that is attributable to the tortious actions of RMA and Deliverance is the primary effect of RMA's and Deliverance's tortious conduct. And, Plaintiffs assert, that injury accrued primarily in Minnesota. Consequently, also when applying the effects test to the facts presented here, personal jurisdiction over RMA and Deliverance is proper in this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, Defendants' motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

In reaching this conclusion, the Eighth Circuit, like the\n   <em>\n    Reynolds\n   </em>\n   court, reasoned that the right of publicity \"protects pecuniary, not emotional, interests\" and described the underlying policy interest as \"akin to the policy underlying the protection of trade names, which Minnesota recognizes.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   While acknowledging that the Minnesota Supreme Court had not yet had the occasion to recognize invasion of privacy and its four causes of action,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Eighth Circuit opined that the Minnesota Supreme Court likely would recognize the right of publicity because the right of publicity protects a person's commercial interest in his or her identity rather than the \"privacy and solicitude of private personae\" protected by invasion of privacy.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Three years after the Eighth Circuit concluded in\n   <em>\n    Ventura\n   </em>\n   that a right of publicity exists under Minnesota law, the Minnesota Supreme Court recognized three of the four causes of action underlying the tort of invasion of privacy, including appropriation.\n   <em>\n    Lake v.

Relying on the Restatement, the\n   <em>\n    Lake\n   </em>\n   court explained that, as a tort, appropriation \"protects an individual's identity and is committed when one 'appropriates to his own use or benefit the name or likeness of another.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11709170\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/582/231/#p233\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 652C (1977) ).

Other sections of the Restatement (Second) of Torts support the determination that appropriation, like the right of publicity, protects a property right.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 652C cmt. a. (observing that \"the right created by [appropriation] is in the nature of a property right\"); \u00a7 652I (noting that, of the four invasion of privacy causes of action, appropriation alone can support a posthumous cause of action); \u00a7 652I cmt. b (likening appropriation to an impairment of a property right).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In light of the\n   <em>\n    Ventura\n   </em>\n   court's characterization of the right of publicity as a property right and the\n   <em>\n    Lake\n   </em>\n   court's reliance on the Restatement's recognition that an estate may maintain an action for appropriation after an individual's death, Plaintiffs persuasively argue that the majority approach is a viable doctrine subject to adoption by the Minnesota Supreme Court,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   warranting recognition of the right\n   of publicity as a property interest that is enforceable by the decedent's estate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Defendants argue that they should not be held \"responsible for violating a law ... that they had no reason to believe existed when the alleged violations occurred.\" This argument is unavailing. The Eighth Circuit decided\n   <em>\n    Ventura\n   </em>\n   in 1995, and an overwhelming majority of courts that have addressed the issue have concluded that the right of publicity exists and is assignable. Given these developments of the law, the possibility of being held liable for violating Prince's right of publicity, even after his death, was more than a remote and fleeting possibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The right of publicity under Minnesota common law is descendible and enforceable by the decedent's estate. Therefore, Defendants' motion to dismiss Plaintiffs' right-of-publicity claim is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Breach of Contract\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Defendants next argue that the breach-of-contract claim against Boxill based on the Confidentiality Agreement must be dismissed for two reasons: (1) Plaintiffs waived the right to enforce the Confidentiality Agreement and (2) enforcement of the Confidentiality Agreement is barred by the statute of limitations. Because several of Plaintiffs' other claims-conversion, theft, and tortious interference with contract-are premised on the applicability of the Confidentiality Agreement, Defendants assert that those claims also must be dismissed. Plaintiffs advance two arguments in response. First, Plaintiffs argue that the Amended Complaint states a plausible breach-of-contract claim. Second, Plaintiffs counter that waiver and the statute of limitations are affirmative defenses to a breach-of-contract claim that are not established on the face of the Amended Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   To prevail on a breach-of-contract claim under Minnesota law, Plaintiffs must prove formation of a contract, performance of any conditions precedent to the right to demand performance by the defendant, and breach of the contract by the defendant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Lyon Fin.

Here, the Confidentiality Agreement that Boxill signed establishes the formation of a contract. Paisley Park Enterprises performed its obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement when it provided Boxill the opportunity to work with Prince. And in paragraph 2 of the Confidentiality Agreement, Boxill disclaims any property interest in \"without limitation, records, documents, photographs\n   or other physical material\" connected to his work with Paisley Park Enterprises. The Confidentiality Agreement also provides that such materials \"shall not be used by [Boxill] in any way whatsoever, and shall be returned to Paisley immediately upon request.\" The Amended Complaint alleges that Boxill removed the Prince Recordings from Paisley Park and provided those recordings to third parties, including Defendants RMA and Deliverance, in violation of the Confidentiality Agreement. These allegations state a plausible breach-of-contract claim against Boxill.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Defendants assert two affirmative defenses as a basis for dismissal: waiver and the statute of limitations.

App. 2005) (waiver). Defendants argue that Plaintiffs waived the right to enforce the Confidentiality Agreement against Boxill when Prince engaged Boxill to perform services expressly prohibited by the Confidentiality Agreement. The Confidentiality Agreement provides that Boxill \"shall not photograph, tape, film or otherwise record any likenesses, performances or activities of [Prince].\" Yet, Boxill argues, he could not have performed his work as a sound engineer without violating this provision of the Confidentiality Agreement. Defendants also argue that the six-year statute of limitations has expired on Plaintiffs' claim for breach of the Confidentiality Agreement because the claim accrued in 2006 when Boxill first recorded Prince in violation of the express terms of the Confidentiality Agreement. Plaintiffs counter that neither affirmative defense is established on the face of the complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   A party to a contract can waive the right to enforce the terms of the contract.\n   <em>\n    Valspar Refinish, Inc. v.

Waiver can be express or implied; the requisite knowledge can be actual or constructive, and the intent to waive can be inferred from conduct.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7054342\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/840/43/#p51\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Here, Defendants argue that Prince waived the right to enforce the Confidentiality Agreement against Boxill by engaging him to perform services that violated the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement. But even if this conduct waived Plaintiffs' right to enforce the provision of the Confidentiality Agreement that prohibited Boxill from recording Prince, without more, it does not follow that such waiver extinguished all of Plaintiffs' rights under the Confidentiality Agreement. Not one factual allegation in the Amended Complaint supports Defendants' contention that Plaintiffs have waived all of their rights under the Confidentiality Agreement. To the contrary, Plaintiffs allege that they have demanded Boxill's compliance with the Confidentiality Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Breach-of-contract claims are subject to a six-year statute of limitations that begins to run when the cause of action accrues, even if the aggrieved party is unaware of the facts constituting the breach.\n   <em>\n    Jacobson v.

App. 2001). As alleged in the Amended Complaint, the breaches of the Confidentiality Agreement are Boxill's distribution of the Prince Recordings to third parties, including RMA and Deliverance, and Boxill's refusal to return upon demand the Prince Recordings to Paisley Park Enterprises. The Amended Complaint does not specify the dates on which Boxill allegedly distributed the Prince Recordings to third parties. But it does allege that Plaintiffs demanded the return of the Prince\n   Recordings in March 2017. This legal action commenced in April 2017. If discovery discloses other breaches of the Confidentiality Agreement that occurred before April 2011, claims arising from those breaches might be barred. But at this early stage of the litigation, the Amended Complaint does not clearly establish that Plaintiffs' breach-of-contract claim is barred by the statute of limitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Because the Amended Complaint alleges facts that, if proved, would establish the elements of a breach-of-contract claim, Plaintiffs have stated a plausible claim for relief. Defendants' affirmative defenses of waiver and statute of limitations are not clearly established on the face of the Amended Complaint. Therefore, those defenses do not warrant dismissal of Plaintiffs' breach-of-contract claim for failure to state a claim on which relief can be granted. Consequently, Defendants' motion to dismiss as it pertains to the breach-of-contract claim is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Defendants also argue that Plaintiffs' state-law claims predicated on the applicability of the Confidentiality Agreement (conversion, theft, and tortious interference with contract) should be dismissed. But because Defendants have failed to establish that the Confidentiality Agreement is inapplicable or unenforceable, Defendants necessarily have not demonstrated that these other contract-based claims should be dismissed at this early stage of the litigation. Having presented no other legal basis for the dismissal of these claims, Defendants are not entitled to the relief they seek. Defendants' motion to dismiss as to Plaintiffs' conversion, theft, and tortious-interference-with-contract claims is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    c. Copyright Infringement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Defendants argue, as they did in opposition to the motion for a preliminary injunction, that Plaintiffs' copyright-infringement claim fails as a matter of law because Plaintiffs lack valid copyright registrations in the disputed recordings. Plaintiffs counter that if the Court interprets Section 411(a) of the Copyright Act so as to permit an\n   <em>\n    application\n   </em>\n   for copyright registration to satisfy the statutory registration requirement, the Amended Complaint states a plausible claim for copyright infringement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Section 411(a) of the Copyright Act provides, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-52\">\n   [N]o civil action for infringement of the copyright in any United States work shall be instituted until ... registration of the copyright claim has been made in accordance with this title.

Section 411(a) requires the dismissal of a copyright-infringement action if the plaintiff has applied for, but has not yet received, a valid copyright registration from the Copyright Office. The statute provides that \"no civil action for infringement of the copyright in any United States work shall be instituted until ... registration of the copyright claim has been made in accordance with this title.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20411\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 411\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). Nothing in that language or in the agency's interpretation of that language indicates that an application for copyright registration satisfies the registration requirement. Statutory terms matter. The policy considerations advanced by Plaintiffs do not provide a sufficient basis for the Court to disregard the plain language of Section 411(a). This conclusion also is consistent with the well-reasoned approach taken by other courts in this District.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Asche\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4269930\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/147/833/#p835\">\n    147 F.Supp.3d at 836-38\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Because the plain language of Section 411(a) makes registration of a copyright a prerequisite to initiating an action for copyright infringement and Plaintiffs as yet have only applied for copyright registrations, Defendants' motion to dismiss is granted as to Plaintiffs' copyright-infringement claim and that claim is dismissed without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    d.

When determining whether the defendant's use of a trademark is likely to cause confusion among consumers as to the source of an allegedly infringing product, a district court considers six non-exclusive factors: (1) the strength of the plaintiff's mark; (2) the similarity between the plaintiff's mark and the alleged infringer's mark; (3) the degree of competition between the products; (4) the alleged infringer's intent to \"pass off\" its product as that of the plaintiff; (5) incidents of actual confusion; and (6) the type of product, the product's cost, and the conditions of purchase.\n   <em>\n    Everest Capital Ltd. v.

The Amended Complaint further alleges that Defendants' promotional materials for the Prince Recordings use the PRINCE\u00ae trademark in an attempt to \"benefit from the fame and goodwill associated with Prince Rogers Nelson.\" Because the PRINCE\u00ae trademark is strongly associated with Prince Rogers Nelson, Plaintiffs argue, a consumer seeing the Prince Recordings for sale on Defendants' website likely would mistakenly believe that the Prince Recordings were released or authorized by Plaintiffs. These allegations state plausible claims for trademark infringement because Plaintiffs allege both that Defendants used the PRINCE\u00ae trademark to sell music, the same type of product sold by Plaintiffs using the PRINCE\u00ae trademark, and that Defendants attempted to pass off the Prince Recordings as authorized by Plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Consequently, the Court denies Defendants' motion to dismiss Plaintiffs' trademark-infringement claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

In their June 14, 2017 response, Defendants stated that no files had been deleted from the Dropbox account in which the files were stored and that Defendants were working with their vendors to have the compact discs and vinyl records delivered to Plaintiffs' counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Plaintiffs supplemented their original filing on July 20, 2017. Based on Plaintiffs' counsel's supplemental declaration and the parties' representations at the hearing on this motion, it appears that as of July 20, 2017, Defendants had delivered the compact discs and all but 25 of the 5,000 vinyl records that were produced. It also appears that no files were deleted from the disputed Dropbox account. Plaintiffs do not unambiguously allege that Defendants possess digital files and have refused to turn them over. Instead, Plaintiffs apparently are uncertain about whether they\n   have received copies of all of the original recording files. At the hearing on July 28, 2017, Defendants represented to the Court that they have provided Plaintiffs all files in Defendants' possession that are subject to the Court's May 22, 2017 Order. Because the record does not establish by clear and convincing evidence that RMA and Deliverance are violating the Court's May 22, 2017 Order, Plaintiffs' motion for an order to show cause for civil contempt is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Also at the July 28, 2017 hearing, the parties addressed whether the $1 million bond posted by Plaintiffs to secure the temporary restraining order is sufficient to secure the preliminary injunction order.

Within 14 days after the date of this Order, Plaintiffs are directed to either verify in writing that the bond issued on May 4, 2017, secures the preliminary injunction order or post a new bond in the amount of $1 million to secure the preliminary injunction order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDER\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    Although the parties have submitted affidavits and other evidence in conjunction with the motions for injunctive relief previously filed in this case, the factual allegations in this section are taken solely from Plaintiffs' Amended Complaint.
