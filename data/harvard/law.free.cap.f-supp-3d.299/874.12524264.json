PARKER, U.S. DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   On February 17, 2016, Plaintiff Barbrie Logan commenced this lawsuit alleging sex discrimination and retaliation by her former employer, Defendant MGM Grand Detroit Casino. The matter has been referred to Magistrate Judge Anthony P. Patti for all pretrial matters. (ECF No. 18.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On July 13, 2017, Defendant filed a motion for summary judgment pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56. (ECF No. 40.) In a Report and Recommendation filed February 12, 2018, Magistrate Judge Patti recommends that the Court grant the motion. (ECF No. 51.) Specifically, Magistrate Judge Patti finds that Plaintiff's claims are barred by the six-month statute of limitations set forth in a pre-employment \"Disclosure, Release, and Authorization\" Plaintiff completed as part of her online job application. Magistrate Judge Patti concludes that the six-month limitations period is enforceable but must take into consideration the EEOC's period of exclusive jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   At the conclusion of his decision, Magistrate Judge Patti informs the parties that they must file any objections to the R &amp; R within fourteen days. Plaintiff filed objections on February 27, 2018. (ECF No. 52.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   1 When objections are filed to a magistrate judge's R &amp; R on a dispositive matter, the Court \"make[s] a de novo determination of those portions of the report or specified proposed findings or recommendations to which objection is made.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1). The Court, however, \"is not required to articulate all of the reasons it rejects a party's objections.\"\n   <em>\n    Thomas v. Halter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11138125\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/131/942/#p944\">\n    131 F.Supp.2d 942\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 944 (E.D. Mich. 2001) (citations omitted). A party's failure to file objections to certain conclusions of the R &amp; R waives any further right to appeal on those issues.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Smith v. Detroit Fed'n of Teachers Local 231\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1758456\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/829/1370/#p1373\">\n    829 F.2d 1370\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1373 (6th Cir. 1987). Likewise, the failure to object to certain conclusions in the magistrate judge's report releases the Court from its duty to independently review those issues.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Thomas v. Arn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6200101\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/474/140/#p149\">\n    474 U.S. 140\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 149,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6200101\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/474/140/#p149\">\n    106 S.Ct. 466\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6200101\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/474/140/#p149\">\n    88 L.Ed.2d 435\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1985).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   As an initial matter, Plaintiff raises numerous complaints in her objections that do not address Magistrate Judge Patti's legal conclusion that her claims are time barred. As such, the Court finds it unnecessary to address them. The Court will respond, however, to Plaintiff's objections to certain words or phrases used by Magistrate Judge Patti, which Plaintiff asserts are reflective of his bias against her or of his unfair treatment of her claims. Magistrate Judge Patti's R &amp; R in fact reflects thoughtful, fair, and careful consideration of Plaintiff's claims, the issues raised in Defendant's motion for summary judgment, and Plaintiff's response to the motion. The Court thus turns to those objections by Plaintiff that actually address Magistrate Judge Patti's statute of limitations analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff challenges Magistrate Judge Patti's conclusion that her claims are time-barred, asserting that she did not agree to the six-month limitations period. While Plaintiff does not expressly deny clicking the \"yes\" button to reflect her agreement with the Disclosure, Release, and Authorization, she states: \"It may have been possible or expedient to simply click the YES\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   button in order to submit the application in the time allotted, without reading and/or understanding its contents.\" (Obj. at 9, ECF No. 52 at Pg ID 1096.) Plaintiff further argues that the pre-employment application containing the six-month limitations period expired ninety days after she completed it on February 20, 2017, and that it therefore did not control her employment when she was hired August 1, 2007.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   2 First, Plaintiff failed to raise these arguments in response to Defendant's summary judgment motion. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 42.) Any arguments made for the first time in objections to an R &amp; R are deemed waived.\n   <em>\n    Uduko v. Cozzens\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4233535\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/975/750/#p757\">\n    975 F.Supp.2d 750\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 757 (E.D. Mich. 2013) (citing\n   <em>\n    Murr v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4232835\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/200/895/\">\n    200 F.3d 895\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 902 n.1 (6th Cir. 2000) ). As the Sixth Circuit explained in\n   <em>\n    Murr\n   </em>\n   , while\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   permits de novo review by the district court if timely objections are filed to an R &amp; R, \"it does not allow parties to raise at the district court stage new arguments or issues that were not presented to the magistrate [judge].\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4232835\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/200/895/\">\n    200 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   902 n.1 (citing\n   <em>\n    United States v. Waters\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11673694\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/158/933/#p936\">\n    158 F.3d 933\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 936 (6th Cir. 1998) ). The Court acknowledges that Plaintiff attempted to file a sur-reply brief in response to Defendant's motion; however, she never indicated in her request to file the sur-reply that she sought to present the arguments she now raises. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 46.) In any event, Plaintiff's newly asserted arguments lack merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   3 Plaintiff agreed to be bound by the six-month limitations period when she clicked \"yes\" in response to the question of whether she agreed with the terms of the Disclosure, Release, and Authorization and then electronically signed her name. Under Michigan law (which applies to this Court's analysis of whether a valid agreement was formed), \"[a] record or signature shall not be denied legal effect or enforceability solely because it is in electronic form.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mich.%20Comp.%20Laws%20%C2%A7%20450.837\">\n    Mich. Comp. Laws \u00a7 450.837\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Further, under Michigan law, a party who signs a contract (in this case an agreement to be bound by a six-month statute of limitations) ordinarily is presumed to have read, understood and assented to its terms.\n   <em>\n    Burkhardt v. Bailey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1402692\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mich-app/260/636/\">\n    260 Mich.App. 636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=680%20N.W.2d%20453\">\n    680 N.W.2d 453\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 464 (2004) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stout v. J.D. Byrider\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11228455\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/228/709/#p715\">\n    228 F.3d 709\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 715 (6th Cir. 2000) (\"One who signs a contract is presumed to know its contents, and ... is bound by its provisions.\") (ellipsis in original and citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Further, and contrary to Plaintiff's assertion, the terms of the Disclosure, Release, and Authorization did not expire in ninety days. The provision itself does not contain a time limit on its application, and instead states to the contrary: \"This release and authorization shall remain valid and in effect\n   <em>\n    during my employment\n   </em>\n   ....\" (ECF No. 40-4 at Pg ID 641, emphasis added.) Moreover, by agreeing to the Disclosure, Release, and Authorization, Plaintiff expressly agreed \"that any claim or lawsuit\n   <em>\n    arising out of my employment with\n   </em>\n   , or my application for employment with, MGM Grand ... must be filed no more than six (6) months after the date of the employment action that is the subject of the claim or lawsuit.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , emphasis added.) Presumably Plaintiff intended for her employment to last longer than ninety days. The reference to ninety-days on which Plaintiff replies is found elsewhere in the employment application and is limited expressly to how long the application will be considered current. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at Pg ID 642.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiff's next objection relates to her assertion that the claim she filed with the State of Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs Unemployment Insurance Agency tolled the statute of limitations. Magistrate Judge Patti thoroughly addressed that argument (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   R &amp; R at\n   13-14, ECF No. 51 at Pg ID 1077-78), and correctly in this Court's view.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Plaintiff also objects to the R &amp; R based on her assertion that she satisfied the six month limitations period by filing this lawsuit sixteen days after certain \"post-employment retaliatory action.\" The action Plaintiff is referring to is conduct by an employee from Defendant's Human Resources Department during the June 22, 2015 telephonic hearing before an ALJ on her unemployment benefits claim. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Obj. at 10-11, ECF No. 52 at Pg ID 1097-98.) Again, Plaintiff raises this argument for the first time in her objections and thus it is waived. In any event, Plaintiff does not mention this post-employment conduct anywhere in her Complaint as a basis for the sex discrimination or retaliation claims asserted here. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl., ECF No. 1.) Nor does Plaintiff refer to this conduct in her response to Defendant's summary judgment motion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Resp., ECF No. 42.) As such, the limitations period did not begin to run for purposes of this lawsuit when the alleged post-employment retaliatory conduct occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Despite Plaintiff's assertions to the contrary, this Court does not find any disputes of fact relevant to the statute of limitations issue. The Court also concludes that Magistrate Judge Patti correctly analyzed the legal issue of whether the six-month limitations period bars Plaintiff's claims. The Court therefore adopts the recommendations in Magistrate Judge Patti's February 12, 2018 R &amp; R. Nevertheless, because the Court finds the issues raised by Plaintiff to have been meritorious, it is denying Defendant's request for costs and attorney's fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Accordingly,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that Defendant's motion for summary judgment is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION TO GRANT DEFENDANT'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT (DE 40)\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Anthony P.

However, the Court should deny Defendant's request for an award of costs and attorney fees associated with this motion (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   DE 40 at 3, 32), as the issues on which this recommendation is based merited review by the Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Plaintiff Barbrie Logan filed this lawsuit\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   against Defendant MGM Grand Detroit Casino (\"Casino\"). The facts underlying Plaintiff's complaint stem from her employment as a culinary utility person, and her causes of action include sex discrimination and retaliation in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. (DE 1 \u00b6\u00b6 1-2, 29-38.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Defendant filed an answer and affirmative defenses on March 24, 2016. Among other things, Defendant asserted that Plaintiff's claims \"may be barred, in whole or in part, by applicable statute(s) of limitation or limitation period(s), contractual or otherwise.\" (DE 10 \u00b6 14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Instant Motion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Judge Parker referred this case to me for all pretrial proceedings. Currently before the Court is Defendant's July 13, 2017 motion for summary judgment. In sum, Defendant requests that the Court \"dismiss Plaintiff's claims against it in their entirety with prejudice,\" and \"award Defendant its costs and attorneys' fees in having to file the instant Motion.\" (DE 40 at 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Plaintiff filed a tardy response, which was nevertheless accepted and considered, and Defendant filed a reply. (DEs 42, 43.) On September 19, 2017, the Court denied Plaintiff's request to file a sur-reply. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DEs 46, 45, 47.) On October 10, 2017, I entered a notice of determination of motion without oral argument. (DE 48.) Plaintiff filed a response to this notice, wherein she noted, among other things, her expectation \"to be heard during oral argument to designate specific facts and admissions on file in this case not specified in the written Response.\" (DE 49.) However, the Court has been adequately informed from the briefing, and this motion is ready for a report and recommendation on the papers alone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Fed.

While the filing of an EEOC charge is not the same as the filing of a lawsuit or the commencement of an action, it is certainly more akin to the filing of a \"claim\" in the sense that, \"[t]he most natural reading of these provisions [in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e-5(b), (e)(1) ] is that the first is intended to be definitional, defining a 'charge' as an allegation of discrimination....\"\n   <em>\n    Edelman v.

A \"claim,\" in turn, is defined as \"[t]he assertion of an existing right[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Claim\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Black's Law Dictionary\n   </em>\n   (10th ed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   2014). A claim necessarily involves making allegations. An EEOC charge under Title VII makes an allegation of discrimination (on one or more of several eligible bases) and, in so doing, essentially asserts an existing right to be free from discrimination. Once the EEOC relinquishes its jurisdiction by issuing a notice of right to sue letter, a plaintiff would have whatever time is remaining under the contractual limitations period in which to file suit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Reconciling the ostensive conflict in the case law of both the Sixth Circuit and the Eastern District of Michigan, but applying the common principles which emerge from it, it is clear that if Plaintiff had pursued her EEOC charge within the 180 day filing period described in \u00a7 2000e-5(e)(1), the EEOC would have had \"exclusive jurisdiction over the subject matter of the charge for 180 days\n   <em>\n    after the filing of the charge.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    Lewis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9368501\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/241/769/#p772\">\n    241 F.Supp.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   772 (citing\n   <em>\n    Frank's Nursery &amp; Crafts, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"727218\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/177/448/#p462\">\n    177 F.3d at 456\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added) ). That is, once the charge has been filed, the EEOC may consider it for up to\n   <em>\n    another\n   </em>\n   180 days before the aggrieved party may seek to file suit on his or her own. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(f)(1). In other words,\n   <em>\n    the contractual limitation would have been equitably tolled while the EEOC maintained exclusive jurisdiction.\n   </em>\n   In this case, Plaintiff did not file her EEOC charge within 180 days of her employment separation, or, for that matter, within the six-month contractual limitation period (which is equivalent to 182.5 days in a non-leap year). Had she filed her charge soon after her employment separation, the EEOC might have made short shrift of it, as occurred in\n   <em>\n    Smithson\n   </em>\n   , leaving her a comfortable window of whatever remained of the six-month contractual period once it started to run again, within which to file a timely lawsuit. Had she waited until the 179\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   day to file her charge, she would have gained at least three days of breathing room to file suit once her right to sue letter issued (182.5 days, minus 179 days).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Instead, Plaintiff waited until 216 days after her separation to file her EEOC charge. The EEOC's jurisdiction not having been brought into play until after the six-month contractual limitation period for filing a claim or lawsuit had run, and well after the 180 days provided by statute, she ought not receive the benefit of equitable tolling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Admittedly, the equitable tolling approach has not been articulated in any of the above-cited cases; however, it seems to account for this Court's previously expressed concerns, harmonizing several core concepts. First, it takes into account the fact that \"both Michigan state courts and federal courts applying Michigan law consistently uphold similar 180-day statutes of limitation in employment cases, whether they allege federal or state claims.\"\n   <em>\n    Fritz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4138695\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/835/377/#p382\">\n    835 F.Supp.2d at 380\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (referencing several cases).

Protected by equitable tolling-effectively, treating the filing of the EEOC charge as the commencement of an action, or in this case, as the \"filing of a claim\"-a plaintiff who files her EEOC charge within 180 days of the discriminatory conduct (under \u00a7 2000e-5(e)(1) ) would preserve her right to file suit (in accordance with the contractual limitations period) while the EEOC conducts its investigation (under \u00a7 2000e-5(f)(1) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Fourth, as the Court pointed out in\n   <em>\n    Smithson\n   </em>\n   , the EEOC does not \"always retain[ ] jurisdiction over a charge for a period of 180 [days] after the filing of any charge[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Smithson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%20465564\">\n    2016 WL 465564\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 n.4. A blanket rule that refuses to enforce any contractual limitations period which is less than 180 days fails to take into consideration the fact that an EEOC charge, investigation, and issuance of a right to sue letter may all occur well before six months has passed. Of course, any contractual limitation period which is less than 180 days would still be subject to judicial scrutiny for reasonableness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Fifth, equitable tolling is consistent with the observation made in\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   that \"the submission of an EEOC charge should count, for the purpose of a contractual six-month limitation, as the commencement of an action.\"\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%20119395\">\n    2013 WL 119395\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 n.1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Finally, it is important to note, at least for purposes of this case, that the 180-day time period for filing a charge with the EEOC under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(e)(1) is slightly shorter than the six months (182.5 days or 183 days in a leap year) provided in this contract. Thus, the conclusion in\n   <em>\n    Fritz\n   </em>\n   that \"any period of\n   <em>\n    180 days or less\n   </em>\n   is preempted by the EEOC's period of exclusive jurisdiction and necessarily precludes any judicial consideration of Plaintiff's claim\" need not be addressed here.\n   <em>\n    Fritz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4138695\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/835/377/#p382\">\n    835 F.Supp.2d at 383\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). In the instant matter, the contract at issue provided\n   <em>\n    more\n   </em>\n   than 180 days for filing a claim or lawsuit. More to the point, by equitably tolling the timeclock spelled out in the contract, had this plaintiff filed her EEOC charge at any time within 180 days after the alleged unlawful employment practice occurred, she would not have been precluded from any judicial consideration under the six-month limitation period (assuming she filed her lawsuit within the remaining portion of the contractual period once the EEOC's period of exclusive jurisdiction had expired).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Here, Plaintiff agreed to file \"\n   <em>\n    any claim or lawsuit\n   </em>\n   ...\n   <em>\n    no more than six (6) months\n   </em>\n   after the date of the employment action that is the subject of the claim or lawsuit.\" (DE 40-4 at 2.) Working from the\n   latest date covered by her complaint-the December 4, 2014 termination of the employment relationship-any claim or lawsuit regarding this event (or, giving Plaintiff the benefit of the doubt, any EEOC charge regarding same) should have been filed on or about June 4, 2015. Stated otherwise, even treating Plaintiff's July 8, 2015 submission of her EEOC charge as the filing of her \"claim\" or \"commencement of an action\" (instead of the February 17, 2016 filing of her complaint in this Court), or, applying equitable tolling upon the filing of an EEOC charge, Plaintiff's action was around 34 days late under the agreed upon six (6) month statute of limitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The agreement between Plaintiff and Defendant to limit the statute of limitations to six (6) months is enforceable but must take into consideration the EEOC's period of exclusive jurisdiction. More than six months passed between the termination of Plaintiff and Defendant's employment relationship and Plaintiff's filing of her EEOC charge. In other words, the statute of limitations expired before Plaintiff invoked the EEOC's period of exclusive jurisdiction. If the Court agrees with these conclusions, then it need not address:\n   <strong>\n    (a)\n   </strong>\n   the timeliness of Plaintiff's July 8, 2015 EEOC charge under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(e)(1) as to the 2009-2014 time period at issue in Plaintiff's complaint, or\n   <strong>\n    (b)\n   </strong>\n   the merits of Plaintiff's Title VII sex and retaliation discrimination claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Accordingly, the Court should\n   <strong>\n    GRANT\n   </strong>\n   Defendant's July 13, 2017 motion for summary judgment (DE 40) and dismiss with prejudice the claims set forth in Plaintiff's complaint (DE 1).

In addition, a court may someday have to visit whether Section 2000e-5(f)(1)'s post-notification 90-day period to file suit is, itself, subject to contractual limitation or should trigger equitable tolling.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    , Ann K.
