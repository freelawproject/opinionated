FURMAN, United States District Judge:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In 2014, Plaintiff Lindsey A. Kidd applied for a job with the Georgia Department of Public Health (\"GaDPH\"). Using a subscription-based online research platform operated by Defendant Thomson Reuters Corporation (\"Thomson Reuters\"), the GaDPH obtained information indicating that Kidd had been convicted of a crime. That information turned out to be wrong, but in the meantime it appears to have cost Kidd the job. As a result, she now brings claims against Thomson Reuters under the Fair Credit Reporting Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201681\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , (\"FCRA\"), a statute that protects consumers with respect to the collection and dissemination of personal information collected by \"consumer reporting agencies.\" The question presented here, which raises issues of first impression in this Circuit, is whether Thomson Reuters qualifies as a \"consumer reporting agency\" covered by the statute. The Court concludes that it does not and, thus, grants summary judgment to Thomson\n   Reuters with respect to all of Kidd's claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The following relevant facts, taken from the Complaint and admissible materials submitted by the parties, are undisputed unless otherwise noted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Costello v. City of Burlington\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4087567\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/632/41/#p45\">\n    632 F.3d 41\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 45 (2d Cir. 2011). At issue in this case is an online research platform-called Consolidated Lead Evaluation and Reporting or \"CLEAR\" for short-offered by Thomson Reuters to subscribers. (Docket No. 49 (\"Def.'s SOF\") \u00b6 3). CLEAR \"provides subscribers with access to proprietary and public records information for investigative purposes.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 4, 8). It is primarily used by federal, state, and local government agencies to investigate crimes and suspected fraud. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 5-7). The platform includes public records information regulated by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (\"GLBA\") and the Driver's Privacy Protection Act (\"DPPA\"), so prospective customers are required to have permitted uses under those statutes to access data and must identify and certify those permitted uses to Thomson Reuters in various documents. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 9, 10). Similarly, each time an authorized user seeks access to CLEAR, that user must select a permitted use for undertaking the search (such as a use permitted by the GLBA, the DPPA, or state voter registration laws). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11). Only then can the user enter a search query into CLEAR. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12). A subscriber searching CLEAR by using a name may retrieve a wide array of records-including aliases, court docket references, criminal history, and other information associated with the name. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14; Docket No. 57 (\"Pl.'s SOF\") \u00b6 14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Significantly, Thomson Reuters explicitly prohibits the sale and use of CLEAR for any purpose regulated by the FCRA. (Def.'s SOF \u00b6 18). It communicates and enforces that prohibition in several ways, including employee training, mandatory employee reporting, marketing materials, contractual requirements, mandatory customer certifications, customer vetting, investigations, and remedial actions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 21-68). Additionally, Thomson Reuters will not sell CLEAR to customers that lack a permitted use for the product or have only FCRA-regulated uses. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39). Despite these efforts, Thomson Reuters has discovered instances in which CLEAR subscribers have used the platform for employment screening and other purposes regulated by the FCRA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 63; Pl.'s SOF \u00b6\u00b6 60, 63). When the company learns of such alleged misuse, it opens an investigation. (Def.'s SOF \u00b6 64). There were forty-six such investigations from May 1, 2012, through the filing of Kidd's complaint. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 68). After conducting investigations in those cases, Thomson Reuters terminated ten CLEAR subscriber accounts; concluded that twelve of the subscribers had not misused CLEAR; and secured new attestations of compliance from the other twenty-four subscribers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In November 2014, Kidd applied for a job as an Immunization Program Consultant with the GaDPH and agreed in writing to submit to a \"criminal history and background check.\" (Pl.'s SOF \u00b6 76). Kidd received word from GaDPH that she was the top candidate for the position and was given an expected start date. (Pl.'s SOF \u00b6\u00b6 77, 78). On November 10, 2014, however, GaDPH obtained a \"National Comprehensive Report\" through CLEAR, which included criminal history information purportedly about Kidd (in addition to her date of birth, social security number, and information on her professional license status). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 14, 94-95). Most significant for present purposes, the report stated that Kidd was divorced and that she had been convicted of a crime in Baltimore, Maryland-both of which were inaccurate. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6\u00b6 95, 96). On December 16, 2014, a GaDPH representative advised Kidd that there was a problem with her application because a criminal case had appeared on her background check. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 79). Kidd did not obtain access to the CLEAR results until after she hired an attorney; in the meantime, the possibility of a job at GaDPH disappeared. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 82, 88, 91-92). Kidd allegedly could not find another suitable job until April 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 93; Docket No. 64).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On March 4, 2016, Kidd filed putative class action against Thomson Reuters, alleging violations of the FCRA. (Docket No. 1 (\"Compl.\")). At the initial pretrial conference, the parties proposed, and the Court agreed, to bifurcate the case, with a first phase limited to discovery on the threshold issues of whether Thomson Reuters is a \"consumer reporting agency,\" as defined in Title 15, United States Code, Section 1681a(f), and whether CLEAR reports are \"consumer report[s],\" as defined in Title 15, United States Code, Section 1681a(d)(1). (Docket No. 19, at 2; Docket No. 27). Thomson Reuters now moves for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    THE SUMMARY JUDGMENT STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Summary judgment is appropriate where the admissible evidence and pleadings demonstrate \"no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.

Significantly, by its terms, the statute applies only to a \"consumer reporting agency\" (or \"CRA\"), which is defined, in relevant part, as any person or entity \"which, for monetary fees, dues, or on a cooperative nonprofit basis, regularly engages in whole or in part in the practice of assembling ... information on consumers for the purpose of furnishing consumer reports to third parties.\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681a(f). A CRA, therefore, is defined in part by reference to a \"consumer report.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Rather unhelpfully, however, \"consumer report\" is defined, circularly, by reference to the definition of a CRA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681a(d)(1). That is, the statute defines \"consumer report,\" in relevant part, as the \"communication of any information\n   <em>\n    by a consumer reporting agency\n   </em>\n   bearing on a consumer's credit worthiness, credit standing, credit capacity, character, general reputation, personal characteristics, or mode of living which is used or expected to be used or collected in whole or in part for the purpose of serving as a factor in establishing the consumer's eligibility for\" various purposes, including employment.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4015535\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/49/377/#p381\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In interpreting a statute, a court \"must begin with the language employed by Congress and the assumption that the ordinary meaning of that language accurately expresses the legislative purpose.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Doing so here, the Court concludes that whether Thomson Reuters qualifies as a CRA turns in the first instance on whether its subjective purpose in assembling information concerning consumers is to furnish consumer reports to third parties. That is because an entity qualifies as a CRA only if it \"regularly\" assembles information on consumers \"\n   <em>\n    for the purpose of\n   </em>\n   furnishing consumer reports to third parties,\" and \"purpose\" means \"[t]he reason for which something is done or created or for which something exists\" or to \"[h]ave as one's intention or objective,\" OXFORD ENGLISH ONLINE DICTIONARY , https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/purpose (last visited October 25, 2017);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   MERRIAM-WEBSTER ONLINE DICTIONARY , https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/purpose (last visited October 25, 2017) (defining \"purpose\" as \"something set up as an object or end to be attained\" or \"intention\"). By its plain terms, therefore, the statute applies only to a person or entity that regularly assembles consumer information with a particular purpose or subjective intention-namely, of providing it to third parties for use (actual or expected) in connection with an FCRA-regulated end, such as employment eligibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Notably, that conclusion is consistent with the approach taken by courts in other Circuits, which have looked to the subjective intent of defendants in determining whether they qualified as CRAs under the FCRA. In\n   <em>\n    Liberi v. Taitz\n   </em>\n   , No. 11-CV-0485 (AJG),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%2010919114\">\n    2012 WL 10919114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (C.D. Cal. Mar. 16, 2012), for example, the Court concluded that the defendant, which operated a public records search engine similar to CLEAR, was not a CRA because, among other things, it had \"established that it did not\n   <em>\n    intend\n   </em>\n   the Background Reports [it issued] to be credit reports.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *6 (emphasis added). By contrast, the court in\n   <em>\n    Lewis v.

Indeed, Thomson Reuters takes affirmative steps-through both words and actions-at every stage of the customer acquisition, application, contracting, and support processes to ensure that subscribers are not using CLEAR for FCRA-regulated purposes. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s SOF \u00b6\u00b6 21-68). For instance, it trains and tests its employees on prohibited uses for CLEAR, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 22-32); it includes admonitions and disclaimers on its marketing materials, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 33-38); it requires its subscribers to agree in writing to not use CLEAR for prohibited purposes, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 40-42); it mandates that all subscribers complete a certification process, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 45-51); it vets its customers before providing them access to the platform through a credentialing process, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 52-56); it requires all subscribers to verify the continuing accuracy of their certifications every two years, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 58); it instructs employees to report any misuse, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 62-64); and it sets out methodical remediation procedures to weed out those abusing the platform, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 62-68). By contrast, there is no evidence in the record that, in making the CLEAR platform available to its subscribers, Thomson Reuters assembled information on consumers with the subjective intention of supplying \"consumer reports.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Kidd points to the fact that Thomson Reuters investigated forty-six instances of suspected subscriber misuse as evidence that the company knew that CLEAR would be used for FRCA purposes. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Opp'n 10-11). That number, however, is miniscule when compared to the number of CLEAR subscribers (more than 80,000) and searches (more than 100,000 per day) (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Def.'s SOF \u00b6\u00b6 7, 13), and thus falls far short of establishing that Thomson Reuters \"regularly\" assembles information for the purpose of furnishing consumer reports to third parties, as required to fall within the definition of a CRA. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681a(f) ;\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Rugg v.

Moreover, in every instance of suspected misuse, Thomson Reuters investigated the conduct and either found no actual abuse or took some\n   form of remedial action. (Def.'s SOF \u00b6\u00b6 64, 68). Far from supporting Kidd's argument, therefore, this evidence supports the conclusion that Thomson Reuters has taken meaningful steps to prevent-and thus does not intend-the use of its platform for FCRA-regulated purposes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Liberi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%2010919114\">\n    2012 WL 10919114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7 (\"Here, Plaintiffs'\n   <em>\n    own\n   </em>\n   evidence confirms that Intelius did not intend the Background Reports to be governed by the FCRA.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Finally, Kidd cites a statement by Thomson Reuters in a single CLEAR marketing brochure-namely, that subscribers can use the platform to \"investigate potential clients, employees and other parties,\" (Docket No. 58, Ex. K)-as evidence that the company subjectively intended for CLEAR to be used for FCRA-regulated purposes. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl's Opp'n 5, 10, 18, 23). In doing so, however, Kidd takes the statement out of context. The very next sentence of the brochure states that CLEAR \"shows graphical connections between people, addresses, and phone numbers\n   <em>\n    to help you verify a person's identity\n   </em>\n   ,\" (Docket No. 58, Ex. K (emphasis added)), a purpose that does not fall within the scope of the FCRA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681a(d)(1) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   FED.

Additionally, at its bottom, the brochure states that \"[t]he data provided to you by CLEAR may not be used as a factor in establishing a consumer's eligibility for ... employment purposes or for any other purpose authorized under the FCRA.\" (Docket No. 58, Ex. K). In the face of the many controls Thomson Reuters has put in place to ensure that CLEAR is not used for any FCRA-regulated purposes, no reasonable jury could rely on that one document (of the hundreds of marketing materials in the record, no less) to find that the company \"regularly\" assembles information \"for the purpose\" of providing \"consumer reports\" to third parties. It follows that Thomson Reuters is not a CRA and is entitled to summary judgment on all of Kidd's claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, Thomson Reuters's motion for summary judgment is GRANTED, and all of Kidd's claims are dismissed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   One issue remains: Both parties' submitted briefs or exhibits that were either under seal or partially redacted.
