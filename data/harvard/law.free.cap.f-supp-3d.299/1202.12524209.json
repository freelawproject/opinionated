On March 27, 2017, Plaintiff U.S. Bank National Association, as Trustee for Chase Mortgage Finance Corporation Multiclass Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates Chaseflex Trust Series 2006-1 (\"U.S. Bank\") filed its Complaint for Quiet Title to Real Property, filed March 27, 2017, in\n   <em>\n    U.S. Bank Nat'l Ass'n v.

On July 28, 2017, \"J Brown Successor to First Morgan\" removed the case to federal court. Notice for Removal, filed July 28, 2017 (Doc. 1 at 1-3)(\"Notice of Removal\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Noting that the Notice of Removal is insufficient to demonstrate that the Court has subject-matter jurisdiction, the Honorable Kirtan Khalsa, United States Magistrate Judge, issued the Show Cause Order on September 20, 2017, which directs First Morgan, if it is a business entity, to obtain counsel authorized to practice law before the Court, to cause such counsel to formally enter an appearance, and to show cause in writing why the Court should not remand the Case for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Show Cause Order at 4. In the alternative where First Morgan is a natural person asserting his or her own legal rights pro se, the Show Cause Order directs First Morgan to enter an appearance pro se and to respond to the Show Cause Order.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Show Cause Order at 4.

The Court liberally construes it as First Morgan's response to the Show Cause Order. For the reasons that follow, the Brown Aff. does not demonstrate that the Court has subject-matter jurisdiction. Accordingly, the Court will remand the case to the state court in which U.S Bank originally filed its Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     LAW REGARDING SUBJECT-MATTER JURISDICTION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   It is a well-known principle that courts may examine their subject-matter jurisdiction at any time in the proceedings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tuck v.

In regard to the diversity-of-citizenship requirement, plaintiffs must, as a general rule, specifically allege the citizenship of each defendant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   13B Charles A. Wright, Arthur R. Miller, Edward H. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 3611, at 517-18 (2d ed. 1984).

Under this construction, Brown represents himself pro se, so the Court need not determine whether Brown is eligible to represent First Morgan. The Court concludes that Brown has failed to demonstrate that the Court has subject-matter jurisdiction, so the Court will remand the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     THE COURT DOES NOT HAVE DIVERSITY JURISDICTION\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In the Notice of Removal, Brown asserts, without more, an amount in controversy of $54,058,180.00.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Notice of Removal at 3. Brown also asserts that the \"Defendants are not a resident of New Mexico\" and that the \"Defendants are diverse,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Notice of Removal at 3, because none of the \" 'parties in interest properly joined and served as defendants is a citizen of the State in which such action is brought,' \" Notice of Removal at 3 n.2 (quoting\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201441\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2) ). Because $54,058,180.00, in the context of this action to quiet title to a single lot in a subdivision in Santa Fe, New Mexico, did not, in Magistrate Judge Khalsa's judicial experience and common sense, appear to be a good-faith, plausible estimate of the amount in controversy, and she gave Brown the opportunity to provide evidence establishing his estimate's validity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Show Cause Order at 2-3.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dart Cherokee Basin Operating Co. v.

Because Brown's assertions regarding diversity are legally insufficient, Magistrate Judge Khalsa gave Brown an opportunity to remediate that deficiency by responding to the Show Cause Order.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Show Cause Order at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Brown Aff. does not address Magistrate Judge Khalsa's jurisdictional concerns. Instead, it contains a number of queries and statements that are irrelevant to the Court's subject-matter jurisdiction,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Brown Aff. at 2 (\"is it not true, i believe, whomever has a vested interest in said case should reply post haste so it can be determined who or what is before this Court?\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 3 (\"i James, a man, believe my claim is before the Court. i James, a man, intend to do no harm. i James, a man, intend not to trespass. i James, a man, take said Order [to Show Cause] under advisement.\"), and a \"verified\" statement that \"James\" \"intend[s] to amend,\" Brown Aff. at 1. Consequently, the Court agrees with Magistrate Judge Khalsa and concludes that Brown's assertion that his claim is worth $54,058,180.00 is implausible such that Brown has not included a good-faith, plausible allegation that the case satisfies diversity-jurisdiction's amount-in-controversy requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In addition to not properly alleging the requisite amount in controversy, Brown does not properly allege diversity of citizenship. Brown and U.S. Bank may well be \"citizens of different States,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1), but nothing in the record indicates that is so. The information in the Complaint does not allow the Court to determine the citizenship of either U.S. Bank or First Morgan, and the Complaint does not mention Brown at all. The Notice of Removal contains only an allegation that \"Defendants are not a resident of New Mexico,\" Notice of Removal at 3, and an allegation that-because\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201441\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441\n   </extracted-citation>\n   's in-state-defendant rule is satisfied-the parties are diverse,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Notice of Removal at 3 &amp; n.2. The Brown Aff. provides no relevant information regarding Brown's, U.S. Bank's, or First Morgan's citizenship. Consequently, the Court cannot determine the citizenship of any of the parties, much less that there is complete diversity of citizenship as\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   requires.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Although Brown's filings do not establish that the Court has subject-matter jurisdiction, the Court's independent inquiry reveals that the underlying facts may well satisfy diversity-jurisdiction's requirements. As to the amount in controversy, Brown's allegation that a single lot in Santa Fe is worth more than fifty-four million dollars is implausible, a claim that the value of such a lot exceeds $75,000.00 would be plausible. The Court's cursory internet research confirms that conclusion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Assessment Information Search\n   </em>\n   , SANTA FE COUNTY ASSESSOR'S OFFICE https://www.santafecountynm.gov/assessor/online_tools/assessment_information_search (listing the \"Total Full Value\" of 830 Paseo de Don Carlos-the subject of U.S. Bank's quiet-title suit-as $625,819.00).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Additionally, the parties to the case are probably diverse. \"[F]or the purposes of federal-court diversity jurisdiction ... national banks,\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   corporate entities chartered not by any State, but by the Comptroller of the Currency of the U.S. Treasury ...

U.S. Bank is, thus, a citizen of Ohio for the purposes of diversity jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Court cannot determine Brown's citizenship.

Consequently, the Court cannot soundly infer that Brown is a Texas resident, much less that he is a Texas domiciliary. While Brown's pleadings have either been filed in person at the United States District Court for the District of New Mexico Clerk's office located in Santa Fe or mailed from Santa Fe, the Court cannot soundly infer that Brown is a New Mexico domiciliary, because Brown could be present in New Mexico transiently. That Brown's commercial mail receiving agent markets its services specifically to people who live in Recreational Vehicles (\"RVs\") on a \"full time\" basis strengthens that possibility.\n   <em>\n    FULL TIME RVers\n   </em>\n   , TEXAS HOME BASE, MAIL FORWARDING/RECEIVING , http://www.texashomebase.com/rvers/.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Removal is improper even if Brown is a New Mexico citizen, because \"[a] civil action otherwise removable solely on the basis of [diversity] jurisdiction ... may not be removed if any of the parties in interest properly joined and served as defendants is a citizen of the State in which such action is brought.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201441\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2).
