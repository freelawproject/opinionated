The Court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   [T]he evidence shows that the notice in this case contains a \"Date Mailed\" field, stamped August 19, 2014.

A declaration from an EEOC official in the relevant office notes the EEOC's \"usual and regular procedure\" is \"to mail the [right to sue notice] on the same day, or in some instances on the following day\" as the date reflected on the notice. This furnishes some circumstantial evidence of normal business practices, but does not definitively show the notice was mailed on August 19.

Dallas Rapid Area Transit\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    117\n   </footnotemark>\n   In\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   , the Fifth Circuit considered whether the doctrine of res judicata applied in the employment discrimination context. In that case, the plaintiffs had previously brought suit based on a prior-issued right-to-sue letter, but brought a second suit after having received a second right-to-sue letter. Notably, the plaintiffs in\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   did not receive their second right-to-sue letter until over a month after final judgment in the first suit was entered. The employer moved to dismiss the second suit as res judicata. The plaintiffs asserted that the claims in their second suit could not be considered part of the same series of transactions as those in in their first suit, because the conduct alleged in the second suit, which spanned March 2001 to April 2002, was different from that alleged in their first suit, which spanned November 1998 to February 2001.\n   <footnotemark>\n    118\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The Fifth Circuit first analyzed whether the first and second cases were both based on the same series of transactions. The court concluded that, although the \"factual\n   allegations articulated in the two complaints differ, all of the claims in question originate from the same continuing course of allegedly discriminatory conduct by DART and Chief Rodriguez. Additionally, both lawsuits cite the same motivation for the alleged discrimination-that Appellants 'continue to publicly speak out against race discrimination [at DART].' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    119\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The Fifth Circuit then considered whether a Title VII claim may be barred by res judicata if, at the time of the earlier suit, the plaintiffs have not yet received a right-to-sue letter. In holding that the plaintiffs' first suit precluded the second suit, the Fifth Circuit noted that \"[t]o prevent their claims from being precluded, Appellants could have requested a stay in\n   <em>\n    Davis I\n   </em>\n   until they received their letters.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    120\n   </footnotemark>\n   In so holding, the Fifth Circuit cited several of our sister circuits, all of which have similarly held that Title VII claims are barred \"where the plaintiff failed to take measures to avoid preclusion under res judicata while they pursued the requisite Title VII remedies.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    121\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The case presently before the Court is distinguishable from\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   and its progeny. Plaintiff initially brought Charge 4 as a part of her case in\n   <em>\n    Montgomery-Smith III\n   </em>\n   , but the Court dismissed the allegations based on that charge for failure to exhaust.\n   <footnotemark>\n    122\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because Charge 4 was dismissed without prejudice in\n   <em>\n    Montgomery-Smith III\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiff brought the present suit based on Charge 4 and Charge 5 on June 5, 2017.\n   <footnotemark>\n    123\n   </footnotemark>\n   On June 8, 2017, the Court issued a rule to show cause why\n   <em>\n    Montgomery-Smith III\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Montgomery-Smith IV\n   </em>\n   were not related,\n   <footnotemark>\n    124\n   </footnotemark>\n   and on June 16, 2017, Plaintiff moved to have the cases consolidated.\n   <footnotemark>\n    125\n   </footnotemark>\n   In her motion to consolidate, Plaintiff explained that she sought to consolidate the two cases \"to avoid any issues of collateral estoppel if the related cases are not tried together before the same jury, and to avoid inconsistent results from two juries involving essentially the same material causes of action.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    126\n   </footnotemark>\n   On June 19, 2017, the Court denied Plaintiff's motion to consolidate the cases, explaining that \"[b]ecause trial is set to begin in approximately\n   one month, [and] the parties have already filed their proposed jury instructions, jury verdict form, and voir dire questions,\" the \"Court [would] not delay the trial of [\n   <em>\n    Montgomery-Smith III\n   </em>\n   ] at [that] late date.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    127\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The causes of action in this case unquestionably overlap with the underlying allegations in\n   <em>\n    Montgomery-Smith III\n   </em>\n   . However, because in this case Plaintiff states she does not \"make any claims prior to March 26, 2015,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    128\n   </footnotemark>\n   the date the Court in\n   <em>\n    Montgomery-Smith III\n   </em>\n   found was the last date upon which Plaintiff could rest her claims,\n   <footnotemark>\n    129\n   </footnotemark>\n   and took \"measures to avoid preclusion under res judicata while [she] pursued the requisite Title VII remedies,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    130\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Court finds Plaintiff's Title VII claims based on Charge 4 and Charge 5 are not barred by collateral estoppel.

Although the underlying conduct that formed the basis of Plaintiff's Title VII and \u00a7 1981 claims was the same, the plaintiff's \u00a7 1983\n   claim \"was being brought for a violation of her rights to make and enforce contracts under \u00a7 1981.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    159\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, the Court found the plaintiff could bring a \u00a7 1983 claim in addition to her Title VII claim because she alleged a violation of a separate statutory right under \u00a7 1981 apart from Title VII.\n   <footnotemark>\n    160\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   In this case, Plaintiff alleges that the actions and inactions of Devin George and Darlene Smith, in their individual capacities, in conspiring to retaliate, discriminate, intimidate, isolate, deny promotions, and create a hostile work environment against her violate\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <footnotemark>\n    161\n   </footnotemark>\n   but does not reference any underlying violation other than Title VII and Louisiana Revised Statutes section 9:2798.1. With respect to Plaintiff's alleged \u00a7 1983 claim pursuant to Louisiana Revised Statutes section 9:2798.1, a review of this statute shows that the statute is a \"discretionary immunity statute\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    162\n   </footnotemark>\n   and does not provide a cause of action for plaintiffs. As a result, Louisiana Revised Statutes section 9:2798.1 does not provide a separate statutory violation under \u00a7 1983. Plaintiff has otherwise failed to allege a statutory right separate and apart from those protected by Title VII. In fact, under her \u00a7 1983 cause of action, Plaintiff specifically alleges \"[t]he pattern or practice of discrimination, harassment, and retaliation against [her],\" as detailed in the previous paragraphs within her \u00a7 1983 cause of action,\n   <footnotemark>\n    163\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and 1991.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    164\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, Plaintiff's reliance on\n   <em>\n    Gallentine\n   </em>\n   is misplaced, and her \u00a7 1983 claims must be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   <em>\n    d.
