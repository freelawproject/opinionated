For the reasons that follow, the motion is granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The following facts are alleged in the amended complaint (Dkt. No. 22).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Between January 2015 and January 2017, defendants Joseph Meli (\"Meli\") and Matthew Harriton (\"Harriton\") raised over $97 million from investors, including millions of dollars from Nagelberg and Hayden, in a fraudulent scheme. Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 1-6, 89-150, 216.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Meli and Harriton represented to investors that they had exclusive access to bulk premium tickets to some of the biggest live events in the United States.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34. They told investors that they would pool investor funds to purchase large blocks of tickets for theatrical and live-entertainment events, including the Broadway musical Hamilton, and concerts of popular music artists including Adele, The Rolling Stones, Bob Dylan, Paul McCartney, and others, which they would then resell at a substantial mark-up to secondary market brokers in bulk or directly to fans who attend the events, generating high returns for investors.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 1, 37-40, 52-53, 73, 150, 217.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Meli and Harriton set up four entities, 875 Holdings, LLC, Advance Entertainment, LLC, Advance Entertainment II, LLC, and 127 Holdings LLC (the \"four entities\"), in which plaintiffs and others invested, and which were purportedly to\n   act as vehicles to purchase the tickets.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 5, 24-27, 41-80.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Meli and Harriton showed investors a 2015 letter agreement with Jeffrey Seller, a Hamilton producer, under which Advance Entertainment, LLC purportedly purchased 35,000 premium Hamilton tickets for $7 million (the \"Hamilton agreement\"), and a 2016 letter agreement with September Management, Ltd., under which Advance Entertainment, LLC could acquire up to $15 million of premium tickets to Adele concerts.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 38-39, 55-68. Meli and Harriton told investors that their investment was \"in exchange for an entitlement to certain proceeds from the re-sale of the\" Hamilton tickets and Adele concert tickets.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 58, 64. However, no agreement existed between the defendants and Mr. Seller or September Management, Ltd. to purchase tickets to those events, and the bulk of the money raised from investors was not used to purchase tickets.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 54-68.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Of the more than $97 million raised, over $59 million went directly to prior investors to create the illusion of profitable returns.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 33, 219. More than $10.2 million was misappropriated for Meli and Harriton's personal use.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 220. More than $1.8 million was transferred to other entities controlled by Meli and Harriton and to their family members.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 221.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    TriPoint\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   TriPoint is an investment bank located in New York City.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28. It advertises to investors its trusted advice and proven execution.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 81. TriPoint worked as a placement agent for Meli and Harriton by helping them find investors.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 82. It distributed materials promoting Meli and Harriton's experience, and their plan to buy blocks of tickets to live events in advance of the event and to turn a profit by reselling them in the secondary market.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 83-84. Meli and Harriton paid TriPoint a broker fee tied to the gross proceeds that TriPoint introduced into the investment, and a remainder fee based on profits supposedly earned on particular investments.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 88.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In December of 2015, Hayden met with a TriPoint investment banking associate named Robert Nathan during a conference in Los Angeles.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 89. Nathan told Hayden that TriPoint was acting as a placement agent for an investment with Meli and Harriton.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 90. Hayden told Nathan that he was only interested in low risk investments, and asked what due diligence TriPoint had done on Meli and Harriton and their entities.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Nathan explained the purported investment scheme to Hayden.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 91. He touted Meli's extensive experience in the live event and concert industry and Harriton's extensive investment experience, and told Hayden that Harriton was his family friend who he had known since high school.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 92. Nathan told Hayden that first he would have to invest in a diversified portfolio of live events, following which he could invest in individual high profile events like Hamilton and Adele concerts.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 93.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Nathan showed Hayden the Hamilton agreement, under which Advance Entertainment, LLC purportedly purchased 35,000 premium Hamilton tickets for $7 million, and assured Hayden that TriPoint had verified the agreement and the relationship between Meli and Harriton and Mr. Seller, the Hamilton producer.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 95-96. Nathan told Hayden that TriPoint had examined records of past ticket deals done by Meli and Harriton and verified profits made by investors.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 98. He also told Hayden that TriPoint was verifying all of the wire transfers to the four entities to ensure that all investor money that TriPoint introduced to the investment was being used to fund ticket deals.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 100. Nathan sent Hayden the LLC agreement for 875 Holdings, LLC, as well\n   as other investment documents and instructions on how to proceed with the investment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 103. In January of 2016, Hayden invested $500,000 in 875 Holdings, LLC, in reliance on Nathan's representations.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 102-04, 262-63. Nathan then introduced Hayden to Meli, and in the following months Hayden made additional investments in other entities controlled by Meli and Harriton.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 105-120.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   During their early discussions, Hayden told Nathan that his friend Nagelberg was also considering the investment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 121. Nathan told Hayden about TriPoint's due diligence investigation of Meli, Harriton, and their entities knowing that Hayden would relay that information to Nagelberg, and knowing that Nagelberg would rely on it in deciding whether to invest.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 122, 125. Hayden conveyed to Nagelberg what Nathan told him about the investment opportunity and about TriPoint's due diligence.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 123-24. Hayden also introduced Nagelberg to Meli, and Meli then introduced both Hayden and Nagelberg to Harriton.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 126. In reliance on Nathan's representations, Nagelberg decided to invest.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 123-49, 262-63. Hayden and Nagelberg lost approximately $4.2 million in funds they invested in the four entities.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 265.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Hayden and Nagelberg claim that Nathan lied about TriPoint's investigation into Meli, Harriton, and their entities, and accuse TriPoint of assisting in the fraud. They assert claims against TriPoint for fraud, aiding and abetting fraud, negligent misrepresentation, and unjust enrichment. TriPoint argues that it did not know that Meli and Harriton were engaged in fraud, and moves to dismiss the claims for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    Legal Standard\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), all factual allegations in the complaint are accepted as true and all reasonable inferences are drawn in the plaintiff's favor.\n   <em>\n    DiFolco v.

Those arguments are unavailing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   First, the fraud claim against TriPoint is not based on the fraud Meli and Harriton engaged in, but on false representations that TriPoint made to Hayden. Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 257-58. Nathan told Hayden that TriPoint verified the Hamilton agreement and the relationship between Meli and Harriton and Mr. Seller, that TriPoint reviewed prior returns on ticketing arrangements by Meli and Harriton and verified profits made by investors in those deals, and that TriPoint was verifying wire transfers to the four entities to ensure that the money it introduced into the investment went to fund ticket purchases.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 96, 98, 100, 257. Plaintiffs allege that those statements were false-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , that TriPoint had not actually confirmed the truth of those things-because had TriPoint conducted a proper investigation as it said it did, it would have discovered that there was no agreement to purchase Hamilton tickets, there were no prior profits on ticket deals, and the money it introduced to the deal was not going to ticket brokers but to prior investors and to Meli and Harriton's own use.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 96-97, 99, 101, 258. TriPoint knew when it made those statements the thoroughness of its investigation into the scheme, and plaintiffs urge the reasonableness of the inference that TriPoint must have been aware that its investigation was not thorough enough to support those statements. The possibility remains, as TriPoint argues, that when it made those statements it believed that its investigation was adequate and its conclusions correct. Decision of that point requires hearing and consideration of the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Second, to satisfy Rule 9(b), \"a complaint alleging fraud must '(1) specify the statements that the plaintiff contends were fraudulent, (2) identify the speaker, (3) state where and when the statements were made, and (4) explain why the statements were fraudulent.' \"\n   <em>\n    United States ex rel.
