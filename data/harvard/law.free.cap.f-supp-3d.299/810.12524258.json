AFRICK, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The concept of reasonableness plays a leading role in American law, from the \"reasonable person\" of tort law fame to the \"[t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures\" enshrined in the Fourth Amendment. It is also central to the inquiry currently before the Court: after plaintiff Ana Christine Shelton sought as much as millions in compensatory damages, yet won only nominal damages and no other judicially sanctioned relief, what amount of attorney's fees and costs-if any-would it be reasonable for the Court to award her?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This case arose from Nelson Arce's interactions with the Louisiana criminal justice system. After pleading guilty to a drug possession offense in Louisiana state court, Nelson-who was deaf-was placed on probation in Jefferson Parish.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff alleged that Jefferson Parish probation office staff knew that Nelson required a qualified American Sign Language (\"ASL\") interpreter to effectively communicate, but did not provide such an interpreter to facilitate communication at meetings between themselves and Nelson.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff contended that, as a result, Nelson inadvertently violated the terms and conditions of his probation, leading to his incarceration in the Jefferson Parish Correctional Center (\"JPCC\") for 90 days.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff further alleged that JPCC officials likewise understood Nelson's communication needs, but ignored them.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   For example, plaintiff argued that JPCC officials never interpreted JPCC rules and regulations into ASL for Nelson.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff alleged that Nelson thus did not understand the rules governing inmates in JPCC, but that, notwithstanding, JPCC twice penalized Nelson for violating these rules.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On August 22, 2016, Nelson and his father, Lazaro Arce, filed a lawsuit in this Court against the State of Louisiana, through the Department of Public Safety and Corrections (\"Louisiana\"); Sheriff Newell Normand, in his official capacity as the Sheriff of Jefferson Parish (\"Sheriff of Jefferson Parish\");\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Jefferson Parish.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Their initial complaint asserted claims under Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\") and \u00a7 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (\"Rehab Act\"), and prayed for compensatory damages, as well as declaratory and injunctive relief, against all defendants.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Nearly two months after initiating their case, Nelson and Lazaro filed a motion for a preliminary injunction against Louisiana, asking the Court to order Louisiana to provide a qualified ASL interpreter for Nelson's probation meetings while the case was pending.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Before the Court had an opportunity to hold an evidentiary hearing or otherwise act on the motion, the parties reached an agreement that addressed Nelson and Lazaro's concerns.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   After the parties informed the Court of this development, and with the parties' consent, the Court in a minute entry dismissed the motion for a preliminary injunction as moot.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Several months later and in the midst of discovery, Nelson unfortunately passed away.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   All parties have consistently recognized that Nelson's death was unrelated to the litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   After learning of Nelson's untimely passing, the Court dismissed without prejudice all claims for injunctive relief without opposition.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Shortly thereafter, plaintiff was substituted in Nelson's place and reurged the claims for injunctive relief.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   With plaintiff's consent, the Court granted Louisiana's motion to dismiss plaintiff's claims for injunctive relief, as plaintiff did not have standing to assert such claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Prior to trial, the Court also dismissed all claims against Jefferson Parish,\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   as well as all claims brought by Lazaro.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   Further, the parties held settlement discussions\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   before the U.S. Magistrate\n   Judge about two months before trial. Plaintiff's initial settlement demand was $2 million\n   <em>\n    per defendant\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to plaintiff, she made this demand \"understanding that any settlement would mean no admission of liability, a significant concession particularly in light of Nelson's death\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   -a position seemingly at odds with her recognition that any alleged transgression by defendants did not cause Nelson's death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiff then reduced her demand to $1 million per defendant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff contends\n   that she \"indicated a willingness to negotiate,\" but \"[d]efendants did not give any offer whatsoever.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On the eve of trial, however, defendants offered plaintiff a combined $95,000, inclusive of attorney's fees and costs, to settle the case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff alleges that she countered their offer with \"an admission of liability, $95,000 in damages, plus an application of attorney's fees and costs.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendants argue that \"this never occurred.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   In any event, no settlement was reached, and the case proceeded to trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   After nearly a week of hearing the evidence, the jury found that Louisiana and the Sheriff of Jefferson Parish had both discriminated against Nelson in violation of Title II of the ADA and of \u00a7 504 of the Rehab Act, and that the discrimination had been intentional.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, the jury found that the discrimination had not caused any injury to Nelson-a point hotly contested by the parties-and it therefore did not award plaintiff any compensatory damages.\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   Per the parties' stipulation,\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Court then awarded plaintiff nominal damages of $1 as to each defendant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Plaintiff now requests attorney's fees in the amount of $495,853.50 and costs in the amount of $32,373.08.\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n   Louisiana and the Sheriff Jefferson Parish both oppose plaintiff's request.\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Court will address each of plaintiff's requests in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \"In the United States, parties are ordinarily required to bear their own attorney's fees-the prevailing party is not entitled to collect from the loser.\"\n   <em>\n    Buckhannon Bd. &amp; Care Home, Inc. v.
