LAWSON, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Under the Internal Revenue Code, the government is allowed to assert a lien\n   against the property of a delinquent taxpayer, and sell that property to satisfy the unpaid tax obligation. The tax lien is perfected at the time it is assessed, and, with a few exceptions, no formal filing requirement is necessary for the government to obtain priority over other interests. This case presents the question whether the plaintiff condominium association's lien against the unit of a taxpayer-owner for unpaid condominium assessments satisfies one of those exceptions. The plain language of the Internal Revenue Code compels an affirmative answer, but only as to the amount of the assessments recorded when the IRS filed its public notice of the tax lien. The association's assessment lien will take priority over the tax lien for the amount of the assessment recorded, but not for related costs and attorney's fees, which had not been fixed at the time the IRS's tax lien notice was made part of the public record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The basic facts of the case are undisputed. Defendant Pamela Norwood bought a condominium unit, which was part of the Yarmouth Commons Condominiums. Her unit was conveyed to her by a warranty deed on March 29, 2015. That deed described the unit by reference to the \"Restated Master Deed\" for the condominium property, which was recorded on November 19, 2003. That master deed memorializes an agreement by \"two-thirds of the co-owners and mortgagees of record\" that \"Yarmouth Commons Condominium...shall be held, conveyed,... encumbered,...or in any other manner utilized, subject to the provisions of the [Michigan Condominium Act], and to the covenants, conditions, restrictions, uses, limitations, and affirmative obligations set forth in this Master Deed and Exhibits 'A' and 'B' hereto.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Among other things, Exhibit A, the association's bylaws, memorialized the consent of the co-owners to provisions stating that \"the Association may enforce collection of delinquent assessments by a suit at law for a money judgment or by foreclosure of the statutory lien that secures payment of assessments.\" Another provision states that \"[e]ach Co-owner, and every other person who from time to time has any interest in the Project, shall be deemed to have granted to the Association the unqualified right to elect to foreclose the lien securing payment of assessments either by judicial action or by advertisement.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On September 1, 2015, plaintiff Yarmouth Commons Association assessed condominium association fees due from Norwood that added up to $1,490. Those amounts constituted expenses of the association and late fees from September 1, 2015 to January 10, 2016. On January 28, 2016, the Association recorded a notice of lien with the Register of Deeds for Macomb County, Michigan. The notice stated that the lien was in the amount of $1,490 for \"unpaid assessments,\" but that amount was \"exclusive of interest, costs, attorney fees and any future assessments which may become due.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On April 6, 2015, the IRS made an assessment of past due income taxes against Norwood for the 2009 tax year that Norwood failed to pay. However, notice of that assessment was not made public until February 8, 2016, when the IRS recorded a Notice of Federal Tax Lien with the Macomb County Register of Deeds against the property of Pamela Norwood for her federal income tax liability for 2009. That notice stated the amount of back taxes then due as $67,340.88.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   There appears to have been some pre-suit contact between counsel for the parties about lien priorities. Included in those discussions was the Macomb County treasurer, to whom property taxes on the unit\n   also were owed. However, they were unable to resolve that question, presumably because Norwood's equity in the unit was less than the total amount of the liens. The plaintiff then put the question to the test by filing suit in state court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The government removed the case to this Court and filed a counter-claim against the condominium association, and a cross-claim against Norwood for payment of the past due taxes. Norwood failed to respond to the complaint, and the Court granted the government's motion for a default judgment on its cross-claim. The parties, except Norwood, stipulated that the assessment by Macomb County for unpaid property taxes had priority over the interests of the condominium association and the IRS, and the County was dismissed from the case. After a brief period of discovery, the parties filed their cross motions for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The fact that the parties have filed cross motions for summary judgment does not automatically justify the conclusion that there are no facts in dispute.\n   <em>\n    Parks v.

Yarmouth Commons also contends that it is entitled under the Condominium Act to recover its attorney's fees incurred during efforts to collect the assessment, notwithstanding that the notice of lien did not state the amount of any such fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The government argues that (1) priority of competing liens under federal law, where one of the liens is a federal tax lien, is determined by the general rule of \"first in time, first in right\"; (2) both liens arose, under the applicable laws allowing them, at the time of assessment, and the tax obligation in this case was assessed before the assessment for condominium fees; (3) the assessment for condominium fees was not \"choate,\" as required by federal law, until the notice of the condominium lien was recorded on January 29, 2016; and (4) the exception under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206323\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6323\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), which protects certain holders of \"security interests\" from preemption by unrecorded federal tax liens, does not apply in this case, because the condominium lien is not a \"security interest\" as defined by the statute, since (a) the lien interest was not \"acquired by contract,\" but is instead a \"statutory lien\" that arose by operation of law, and (b) the lien also is not any form of mortgage or other secured interest (e.g., as evidenced by a financing statements filed according to the U.C.C.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Both sides rely on cases deciding priority disputes that arose under the Bankruptcy Code, presumably because there is scant authority on this precise issue under the tax code. However, for reasons discussed\n   below, the bankruptcy cases do not provide much guidance.

In this case, the identity of the lienor (the plaintiff), the property subject to the lien (Norwood's condominium unit), and the amount of the lien ($1,490) all plainly were stated in the recorded notice of lien.

The lien holder's argument was indistinguishable from the plaintiff's position in this case. The Court held: \"While we believe that the established practice of awarding costs in the ordinary sense fairly renders those items an incident of the rights of those protected under section 6323, we see no warrant either in the intent of section 6323 or the practices prevailing among the States at the time of its enactment to treat attorneys' fees as a right entitled to priority over a federal tax lien.
