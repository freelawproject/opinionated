(Doc. No. 1). Ten months later, on April 21, 2016, a Superseding Indictment was returned adding Aweis Haji-Mohamed, Marquis Brandon, and Keno Lane, and seven new counts, including possession of an analogue substance, conspiracy to commit Hobbs Act robbery, using a firearm to commit a crime of violence, possession of a stolen firearm, false declarations before a grand jury, and obstruction of justice. (Doc. No. 46). The charges were amended two months later on June 27, 2016, with the return of the Second Superseding Indictment, adding Charles Braden and Santez Bradford as defendants, and twenty-one new counts, that contained the charges already leveled, plus additional counts including conspiracy, the unlawful transfer of a firearm, theft of a firearm, and possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime. (Doc. No. 67).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   After the return of the Second Superseding Indictment, and given \"the complexity of the case, the numerous pending motions, and the anticipated length of trial,\" the case was reassigned from a visiting judge to the undersigned on May 25, 2017. (Doc. No. 349). Shortly thereafter, on June 8, 2017, the Court entered a number of Orders and Memoranda (Doc. Nos. 365-373), which resolved the vast majority of pending motions. Among them was an Order that severed the case into two trials. One trial would include Counts Sixteen, and Eighteen through Twenty-Six that contained charges only against Bradford and Johnson; the other trial would include the remaining charges against all Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   At a status conference on July 17, 2017, the Court set two trial dates, with the trial involving all Defendants scheduled to begin on April 3, 2018\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   , and the second trial involving Johnson only\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   set to start on May 1, 2018. (Doc. Nos. 400). The Court also informed the parties that the trial dates were firm and would not be changed absent the most extraordinary of circumstances. The Court went on to advise the Government that if it intended to file any additional charges, it should do so at the earliest opportunity because the Court did not intend to continue the trial based upon a late-filed Indictment. This was confirmed in a contemporaneous Order that stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   If the Government intends to secure yet another Superseding Indictment from the grand jury it should do so as promptly as possible. There is no reason for delay because the Middle District presently has three grand juries impaneled. In the interim, counsel for the Government and the Defendants shall make themselves available to discuss any potential charges that may be forthcoming. On or before September 1, 2017, counsel shall meet and the Government shall provide to defense counsel additional evidence relating to such possible or anticipated charges, to the extent it can do so. If these meetings do not occur before September 1, 2017, then counsel for the respective Defendants shall notify the Court immediately. Because the trial\n   dates are firm settings, any continuance will be granted only for good cause shown, and the filing of a Superseding Indictment, unless it comes very late, will not meet that standard.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   (Doc. No. 399 at 1-2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Despite this Court's prompting and suggestion, the Government waited many months before securing another Superseding Indictment. In fact, the controlling Third Superseding Indictment was not returned until February 28, 2018, just six days before the pretrial motion deadline, and little over a month before the first trial was set to begin. While that Indictment adds no new Defendants, it adds eight new counts. Specifically as it relates to Braden, the Third Superseding Indictment adds four charges: two counts of possessing a firearm while an unlawful user of a controlled substance; armed home invasion, and using a firearm in relation to a crime of violence. Those crimes are all alleged to have occurred between January and March 2015, well within the time frame of the charges set forth in the Superseding and Second Superseding Indictments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The timing of the return of the Third Superseding Indictment is a bit suspect,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and undoubtedly adds pressure to Defendants and counsel who are preparing for trial. This Court has expressed concerns in the past about the practice of returning Superseding Indictments on the eve of trial, obviously to no avail. The question presented by Braden's Motion, however, is whether the Government's action in seeking the Third Superseding Indictment warrants dismissal on the grounds of prosecutorial vindictiveness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \"A showing of vindictive prosecution requires (1) an exercise of a protected right; (2) a prosecutorial stake in the exercise of that right; (3) unreasonableness of the prosecutor's conduct; and (4) the intent to punish the defendant for exercise of the protected right.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Rather he relies on the presumption that there was vindictiveness in the return or the additional charges shortly before trial. In this vein, he argues:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   Braden's and other defendant's successful partial granting of the motions to sever placed a great burden on the Government by having to try two cases instead of one. There is no new revelation or discovery to support the government's delayed shift to add the additional charges. At any point in this case, the government could have charged him with these charges and those not to only after plea bargaining was unsuccessful and defendant's pretrial motions were successful and then did so with an extreme delay even after the Court's admonition that the trial date would be firm and no continuances would be granted to the defense unless extreme situations arose.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   There is little reason to suspect that the prosecutor's view of Braden's case changed significantly between the two indictments, given that the government already possessed all of the relevant evidence that supported the third superseding indictment well before procuring the indictment.... [T]he only substantive occurrence between the two indictment was Braden acting based on his pretrial rights to proceed to trial and reject a plea offer and to file for a motion to sever from the other defendant which was granted in part, thereby forcing the United States to try two trials, instead of one on the second superseding indictment. The government has never suggested that any other development altered its perception of the case for over a year that it was pending, so there is nothing to indicate that the superseding indictment compensated for unexpected changes or an incomplete initial grasp of the pertinent issues or facts.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   (Doc.

No. 198) to preclude proof of gang membership. The Court did so because the Government represented that the proof at trial would show that (1) Brandon and Bradford were members of the Five Deuce Hoover Crips; (2) Haji-Mohamed was a member of the Bloods, and (3) those affiliations factored into some of the crimes charged. Brandon now seeks to limit that ruling by requesting that the Government \"be precluded from referencing any supposed gang affiliation related to Mr. Brandon, including in its opening statement, until such time that credible proof is presented to the jury that establishes said fact.\" (Doc. No. 495 at 1-2). He contends that discussion about gang membership prior to proof \"would be unduly prejudicial.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Insofar as Brandon wants to preclude the jury from hearing anything about potential gang membership until the evidence begins, that presents two problems. First, this Court typically reads the Indictment to the jury venire so that the prospective jurors understand what the case is about, and can express any concerns they may have about sitting on the jury given the nature of the allegations. In at least two counts of the Second Superseding Indictment (Counts Fourteen and Fifteen), and at least five counts of the Third Superseding Indictment (Counts Twenty-Two through Twenty-Six), Brandon is identified as a member of the Five Deuce Hoover Crips.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Second, even if the references to gang affiliation are omitted when the venire is read the Indictment, \"a criminal defendant is guaranteed the right to an impartial and unbiased jury.\"\n   <em>\n    Holder v.

Brandon's \"Second Motion to Strike\" (Doc. No. 497)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   In another ruling issued June 7, 2017 (Doc. No. 368), the Court granted Brandon's Motion to Strike (Doc. No. 196) \"with respect to the allegations surrounding the murder of Isaiah Starks.\" (Doc. No. 368 at 1). Accordingly, the phrase, \"which [2] AWEIS HAJI-MOHAMED a/k/a SON SON, aided and abetted by [l] REGINALD JOHNSON, III, a/k/a CHEEFA, and [3]MARQUIS BRANDON a/k/a DUMMY, used to shoot and kill Isaiah Starks a/k/a Blue on or about February 9, 2015\" was ordered stricken from Count Thirteen. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Nevertheless, and while the Third Superseding Indictment eliminated the allegation a pistol was used to kill Starks, it retained the language about the gun being used to shoot Starks in Count Seventeen. That Count reads:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <em>\n    COUNT SEVENTEEN\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   THE GRAND JURY FURTHER CHARGES:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   Between on or about January 22, 2015, and on or about September 11, 2015, in the Middle District of Tennessee, [1] REGINALD JOHNSON, III, a/k/a CHEEFA, [2] AWEIS HAJI-MOHAMED a/k/a SON SON, and [3]MARQUIS BRANDON a/k/a DUMMY each having previously been convicted in any court of a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, did knowingly possess, in and affecting commerce, a firearm, to wit: a Springfield XD, .40 caliber semi-automatic pistol, which [2] AWEIS HAJI-MOHAMED a/k/a SON SON, aided and abetted by [1] REGINALD JOHNSON, III, a/k/a CHEEFA, and [3]MARQUIS BRANDON a/k/a DUMMY, used to shoot Isaiah Starks a/k/a Blue on or about February 9, 2015, and which [1] REGINALD\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   JOHNSON, III, a/k/a CHEEFA, and [3] MARQUIS BRANDON a/k/a DUMMY used around the end of February 2015 to regain possession of a Glock, Model 23, .40 caliber semi-automatic pistol that [1] REGINALD JOHNSON, III, a/k/a CHEEFA had previously sold to another person.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   In violation of Title 18, United States Code, Sections 922(g)(1), 924, and 2.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   (Doc. No. 481 at 9-10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The inclusion of \"used to shoot Isaiah Starks a/k/a Blue on or about February 9, 2015\" contravenes this Court's Order. In a Memorandum Opinion accompanying the June 7, 2017 Order, the Court observed that, while the charges in \"the Second Superseding Indictment are wide-ranging\" and encompass crimes ranging from gun possession, to drug distribution, to Hobbs Act robberies,\" ... \"[t]hrowing an uncharged murder into the mix ... adds a whole new level of prejudice, which can only serve to inflame the passions and/or prejudices of the jury.\" (Doc No. 367 at 6). Therefore, the Court stated that would \"redact the language referencing the Starks' murder from Count Thirteen of the Superseding Indictment,\" and that the \"Motion to Strike will be granted solely with respect to the allegation[s] surrounding the murder of Isaiah Starks.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Part-and-parcel of the allegations surrounding the murder of Starks was that he was shot by Hajid-Mohamed. In fact, the Court prefaced its discussion of the applicable law by observing that its \"only real concern is with the allegation in Count Thirteen that the Springfield XD, .40 caliber semiautomatic pistol was used\n   <em>\n    to shoot and kill\n   </em>\n   Isaiah Starks on February 9, 2015.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4) (emphasis added). To reduce that concern and lessen potential prejudice, the Court entered the Order that specifically stated that the references to the firearm being used \"used to shoot and kill Isaiah Starks\" would be stricken. That ruling. however, \"d[id] not preclude the Government from presenting eyewitness testimony that Haji-Mohamed fired the weapon,\" (Doc. No. 366 at 2), or that others were present when he did so.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Accordingly, Brandon's \"Second Motion to Strike\" (Doc. No. 497) is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   and the Count relating to the shooting and killing of Isaiah Starks is\n   <strong>\n    REDACTED\n   </strong>\n   as set forth in this Court's July 7, 2017 Order (Doc. No. 368). While the Court stands by its ruling relating to what language will be retained in the Indictment, the Government, in its Response to Brandon's Motion (Doc. No. 529), raises a number of arguments as to the allowable scope of proof at trial in relation to the incident involving the shooting and killing of Starks. The Court will consider arguments on that issue at the pretrial conference, or at some other point prior to the start of trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   <strong>\n    VIII.

No. 511)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Although going about it in various ways, each of these Motions is directed at severing one or more of the Counts in the Third Superseding Indictment from those contained in the Second Superseding Indictment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Braden moves to dismiss Count 32 and 33, which added the home invasion charge (Count 32) and another charge of using a firearm during the commission of a crime of violence (Count 33). He argues that those counts \"add a tremendous sentencing exposure to [his] already pending counts,\" and claims \"it would be impossible to think Braden could receive a fair trial on wholly unrelated charges like home invasion when he is charged in a conspiracy to commit a robbery with two codefendants where the evidence against those codefedants far far [sic] outweighs the direct evidence the government will present against Braden in those charges.\" (Doc. No. 510 at 3). He also complains about the potential \"spillover effect\" in that \"[t]here is a danger that on these two counts the jury will convict on the basis of the cumulative evidence of the other conspiracies and firearm charges rather than on the basis of the evidence relating to Braden on these specific counts relating to just him.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Haji-Mohamed notes that the Third Superseding Indictment adds four additional counts against him, including two felon in possession charges (Counts 20 and 21), and stealing (Count 18) and possessing a stolen firearm (Count 19) charges. He acknowledges that these counts \"do not significantly imperil [him] any greater than the Second Superseding Indictment,\" but notes other defendants face \"counts involving serious consecutive time,\" that \"leave[s] them with choosing between two unwanted choice of delay or being unprepared.\" (Doc. No. 508 at 2). He requests either a severance of the new counts or a continuance of the trial, and \"imagines if the Court severed the new counts or proceeded to trial on the Second Superseding Indictment here will be less untimely superseding indictments in the future.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   As for Brandon, he concedes that the Government informed him it would be seeking additional charges prior to the September 1, 2017 deadline imposed by the Court, and that those potential charges were discussed in detail. He notes, however, that \"[t]he Third Superseding Indictment contains eight (8) charges against [him] that were not found in the previous indictment, including two (2) additional Hobbs Act robberies and corresponding violations of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c).\" (Doc. No. 511 at 2). With the filing of those charges, Brandon's \"maximum punishment increased dramatically,\" and he is now \"essentially facing a life sentence.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). He objects to a continuance and argues that proceeding to trial on the new charges on April 2, 2018 would violate\n   <extracted-citation index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203161\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3161\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Brandon is correct that the Speedy Trial Act provides that \"the trial shall not commence less than thirty days from the date on which the defendant first appears through counsel,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203161\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3161\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2), and that thirty days will not have run from the time Defendants were arraigned on the newest Indictment and the April 2, 2018 trial date. In similar fashion, the Government asserts that, because the Defendants \"were not arraigned on the Third Superseding Indictment until March 12, 2018, ... the trial should be continued to April 12, 2018, or soon thereafter to ensure the defendants' [sic] have the statutory 30-day period\" under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203161\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3161\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2).

Any repetition or overlap is necessary precisely because the Government chose to wait a little more than a month before trial to add eight new counts that significantly increases all Defendants' exposure.

This itself was no small feat given the number of lawyers involved, and the fact that the Government estimated the case would take a month and a half to try. Based upon that agreement, the Court cleared its calendar for six weeks (except for Fridays) to devote to this case. At least if the charges contained in the Second Superseding Indictment are tried during this period, the majority of the charges will be resolved one way or another, and the Court will not have lost two-dozen trial days that could have been devoted to hearing other cases. This approach will help to insure the Court's ability to control its own calendar and will not prejudice Defendants by forcing them to go to trial on new charges returned just a month before trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Linton v.

Cal.

No. 511 at 3). Each of the Defendants have been waiting long enough for their day in court on the Second Superseding Indictment: Johnson has been detained since August of 2015; Brandon has been detained since April 2016; and Braden and Haji-Mohamed have been detained since September 2016. Accordingly, the Court will sever the Counts in the Third Superseding Indictment, and proceed to trial on April 2, 2018 on the charges contained in the Second Superseding Indictment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   One final point merits discussion. In his Motion, Haji-Mohamed claims he is \"being rushed to trial,\" and that he \"would prefer a continuance so that Mr. Cooper could act as the lead attorney.\" (Doc. No. 508 at 1). However, at the March 5, 2018 status conference, Haji-Mohamed stated that he was prepared to go to trial on April 2, 2018, with Mr. Komisar serving as lead counsel and Mr. Cooper assisting, so long as the\n   charges were limited to those contained in the Second Superseding Indictment. The Court will hold Haji-Mohamed to the representations that he made in open court and on the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Moreover, Haji-Mohamed is not being \"rushed to trial.\" Quite the contrary, the trial has been scheduled for more than seven months. At the time it was scheduled, Haji-Mohamed was represented by Mr. Komisar, who represents him to this day. True, Robert E. McGuire was added as counsel on November 20, 2017, so that he could he could cross-examine a particular witness, but Mr. McGuire was relieved of his representation after he applied for, and received, a position as an Assistant United States Attorney.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   With the departure of Mr. McGuire,\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Court appointed Mr. Cooper, who is now the fourth lawyer assigned to represent Haji-Mohamed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   As it now stands, Haji-Mohammed is being represented by two-court appointed lawyers, one of whom has been his lawyer since shortly after he was arrested. Haji-Mohamed is in more than capable hands, as both lawyers have extensive federal criminal trial experience. While Haji-Mohamed might prefer to have Mr. Cooper pull the laboring oar, a \" 'defendant relying on court-appointed counsel has no constitutional right to the counsel of his choice.' \"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Rather, the delay allegedly resulted from (1) a state prosecutor had retained jurisdiction over the home invasion charge; (2) counsel ruptured his ACL and damaged his meniscus at the end of October 2017, requiring surgery in mid-December and follow-up rehabilitation; (3) a close family member passed away (apparently around the same time); and (4) counsel is responsible for a large number of cases. However, and while the Court appreciates counsel's injury and the death of a family member, these factors neglect to consider that the state prosecutor gave the federal prosecutor her blessing to proceed with federal charges on July 28, 2017 (\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 7), and a second veteran federal prosecutor entered the case on April 17, 2017 (Doc.
