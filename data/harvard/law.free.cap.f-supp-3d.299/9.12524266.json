Roseberry-Andrews, proceeding\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   , has filed suit under the Freedom of Information Act (\"FOIA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , seeking certain records from the Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\" or \"Defendant\") regarding her employment with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\"ICE\") Freedom of Information Act Office (the \"ICE FOIA Office\"). Defendant has moved for summary judgment, arguing that it has conducted a reasonable search of its records and produced all responsive, non-exempt information. Roseberry-Andrews has cross-moved for summary judgment, alleging that Defendant did not conduct a proper search, was dilatory in responding, did not properly apply FOIA exemptions, and failed to comply with FOIA's \"segregability\" requirement. The Court agrees with Defendant on many of the issues raised by the parties, but ultimately concludes that Defendant has failed to provide sufficient evidence that the ICE FOIA Office conducted an adequate search or complied with FOIA's \"segregability\" requirement. Thus, Defendant's motion for summary judgment will be granted in part and denied in part, with leave granted to file a renewed motion within 60 days. Accordingly, the Court will reserve judgment in part and deny in part Roseberry-Andrews' cross-motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

It has submitted a declaration from Fernando Pineiro, the Deputy FOIA Officer of the ICE FOIA Office, describing its search. ECF No. 22-3 (\"Pineiro Decl.\") \u00b6 1. Pineiro explains that when the ICE FOIA Office receives a FOIA request, it \"identif[ies] which program offices, based on their experience and knowledge of ICE's program offices, within ICE are reasonably likely to possess records responsive to that request, if any, and to initiate searches within those program offices.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    \u00b6 19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Once the ICE FOIA Office has determined the appropriate program offices for a particular FOIA request, it provides points of contact in each component office with \"a copy of the FOIA request and instructs them to conduct a search for responsive records.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   According to Pineiro, \"[p]er the ICE FOIA Office's instructions, the individuals and component offices are directed to conduct searches of their file systems, including both paper files and electronic files, which in their judgment ... would most likely be the files to contain responsive documents.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Once these searches are complete, any potentially responsive documents are sent to the ICE FOIA Office.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In this case, the ICE FOIA Office instructed seven program offices to search for responsive documents.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    \u00b6 24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Those seven offices included five that Roseberry-Andrews asked to be searched (ELR, OPLA, Privacy, ICE FOIA, and OAS) and two that she did not ask to be searched (the Office of Diversity and Civil Rights (\"ODCR\") and the Office of the Chief Information Officer (\"OCIO\") ). The search did not include three offices named in Roseberry-Andrews' request (HR, EEO, and Reasonable Accommodation).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Orig. Compl. Ex. 1 at 8-9. Pineiro's declaration identifies the search terms that five of the seven offices used for their searches. Pineiro Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 33-35, 37-38. Those offices generally searched for terms that included Roseberry-Andrews' name (\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    \u00b6 37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ) or the names of the ICE employees identified in the complaint (\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 35, 38\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).

ECF No. 22-4 (\"Tyrrell Decl.\") \u00b6 1 &amp; Ex. G (\"\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   Index\"). DHS withheld or redacted information pursuant to FOIA Exemptions 5, 6, 7(C), and 7(E).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tyrrell Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 21-39 &amp;\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   Index.

First, she argues that DHS impermissibly delayed responding to her request.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Cross-Mot. Br. at 6. Indeed, she argues both that DHS's delays were so severe that they rise to the level of a \"policy-or-practice\" claim (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , that DHS has established a policy or practice of failing to comply with FOIA requests) and that DHS's delay violated her constitutional right to due process because she needed the documents DHS produced in advance of a court proceeding she asserts took place on August 29-30, 2016.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    at 5-8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Second, she argues that the ICE FOIA Office failed to conduct an adequate search because it \"provided no explanation of the nature of any search that it conducted.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    at 12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
