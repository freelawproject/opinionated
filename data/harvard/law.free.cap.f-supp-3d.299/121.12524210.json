The Blue Family Trusts are irrevocable trusts that are to be \"construed according to the laws of Singapore.\" Deed I \u00b6\u00b6 3, 20; Deed II \u00b6\u00b6 3, 20.

In a fixed trust, the shares of the beneficiaries are explicitly fixed from the outset. Tang Decl. \u00b6 4. In contrast, in a discretionary trust the shares of beneficiaries are not fixed from the outset; instead, the trustee is typically given the authority in the trust deed to determine whether to apply trust assets for the benefit of beneficiaries.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20981\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Claimants are among the currently named beneficiaries of the Blue Family Trusts.

Deed II at 16-17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The discretionary nature of the Blue Family Trusts is evident from the terms of the deeds of settlement, which state that the trustee \"may\":\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   pay or apply the income of the Trust Fund to or for the benefit of all or such one or more of the Beneficiaries exclusive of the other or others of them as shall for the time being be in existence and in such shares if more than one and in such manner generally as the Trustees shall\n   <em>\n    in their absolute discretion\n   </em>\n   from time to time think fit.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Deed I \u00b6 5(c) (emphasis added); Deed II \u00b6 5(c) (same). The trustee also has discretion to decline to distribute income to any of the beneficiaries and, instead, may apply all of the trusts' income to pay maintenance costs, liabilities, or to add to the trust capital. Deed I \u00b6\u00b6 5(a), (b), (d); Deed II \u00b6\u00b6 5(a), (b), (d). The trustee's discretion is similar with respect to capital-it may apply the trusts' capital \"to or for the benefit of all or such one or more of the Beneficiaries exclusive of the other or others of them.\" Deed I \u00b6 6(b); Deed II \u00b6 6(b). Hence, if the trustee decides to distribute income or capital, it has absolute discretion to restrict such payouts to a subset of beneficiaries. In other words, the trustee could distribute all income and capital to some combination of the non-claimant beneficiaries, leaving nothing for the claimants. Furthermore, the trustee has discretion to determine the beneficiaries of the Blue Family Trusts. Specifically, the trustee may, at any time during the trust period, irrevocably remove any beneficiary (including any claimant) from the list of beneficiaries, or elect to add additional beneficiaries.

Accordingly, to the extent that any part of the trust fund remains undisposed at the conclusion of the trust period, the trustee will hold any remaining assets in trust for the Final Repository. Deed I \u00b6 7; Deed II \u00b6 7. However, in exercising its powers throughout the trust period, the trustee \"shall not take into account any interest which the Final Repository as Final Repository may at any time have in the Trust Fund.\" Deed I \u00b6 7(c); Deed II \u00b6 7(c). Nor is the trustee obliged to disclose to any member of the Final Repository that he or she \"may become entitled to an interest in the Trust Fund ... except after ... the Final Repository has become entitled to an absolute vested indefeasible interest in the Trust Fund.\" Deed I \u00b6 7(d); Deed II \u00b6 7(d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   To date, two claimants have received distributions from Blue Family Trust II, while six claimants have not received any distributions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Claimant Ibrahim Atiku Bagudu received a distribution from Blue Family Trust II in the amount of \u20ac117,865 around May 21, 2013.

IBRAHIM BAGUDU'S STANDING BASED ON HIS ANNUITY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   An initial issue is whether claimant Ibrahim Bagudu's annuity provides him, or any other claimants, with standing to contest the forfeiture. By a deed of appointment dated September 3, 2010, the trustee established an annuity of $100,000 from Blue Family Trust II for the benefit of Ibrahim Bagudu. Mullins Stmt. \u00b6 23. Ibrahim Bagudu received four annuity payments (totaling $400,000) between January 2011 and July 2013.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3834725\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/959/81/#p95\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thereafter, when the assets of the Blue Holdings Companies were frozen pursuant to English court orders in connection with this litigation, Ibrahim Bagudu's annuity payments ceased.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24. The government has conceded that the annuity provides Ibrahim Bagudu with a vested proprietary interest in the trust assets.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Tr. of Oct. 26, 2017 Hr'g at 31:19-32:15; Pl.'s Mot. to Strike at 2 n.1, 25; Tang Decl. \u00b6 27. The loss of a $100,000 annuity clearly is a sufficient injury to establish Article III standing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cambio Exacto\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1397261\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/166/522/#p527\">\n    166 F.3d at 528\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Substantial economic harm is plainly the type of injury for which parties may seek redress in federal court.\"). Indeed,\n   Ibrahim Bagudu has already been injured because he has not received annuity payments for the last three years. Forfeiture of the claimed assets will cause that injury to continue, while return of the assets will allow the annuity payments to resume. Thus, Bagudu has also satisfied the causation and redressability elements required for standing. The government nonetheless contends that there are impediments to, or limitations on, Bagudu's standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   To begin with, the government argues that Bagudu lacks standing because his annuity merely gives him an interest in the trust assets which \"consist of shares of stock in the Blue Holdings Companies ... [and] it is well established that a corporate shareholder does not have standing to challenge the forfeiture of the corporation's property.\" Pl.'s Mot. to Strike at 25. It is true that courts generally have held that a corporate shareholder lacks standing to contest the forfeiture of a corporation's assets.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Apr. 16, 2009). But Ibrahim Bagudu does not assert standing as a mere shareholder. He instead asserts his claim as an annuitant-and, in that capacity, it is clear that he has a proprietary right to a specific portion of the claimed assets, and will be directly harmed by forfeiture of those assets.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mot. to Strike at 24-25 (\"[T]he Claimants have no present, vested interest in any\n   <em>\n    specific\n   </em>\n   property, other than Ibrahim Bagudu's interest in the Annuity.\" (emphasis added) ). In fact, the government's expert, Professor Tang, did not characterize the annuity as a proprietary right to shares of stock-he instead stated that Bagudu has a present right to $100,000. Tang Dep.

And it appears that he so conceded for good reason-this point is widely acknowledged in the scholarly treatises on discretionary trusts.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Graham Virgo,\n   <em>\n    The Principles of Equity and Trusts\n   </em>\n   381 (2d ed. 2016), Ex. 4 to Pl.'s Reply [ECF No. 192-5] (\"A discretionary trust is a trust for distribution subject to a power of selection which is exercisable by the trustees amongst the objects of the trust.

Opp'n at 21-22. The Court will analyze these asserted rights in turn. Ultimately, they are of little aid to claimants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The first two rights involve claimants' ability to sell for value their interests as (1) beneficiaries entitled to an equal share of the trust assets upon termination and (2) members of the Final Repository. But \"the ability to assign or sell a thing for value does not say anything about the nature of the [interest] assigned or sold.\" Pl.'s Reply at 12. It is plain that claimants lack any proprietary interest in any specific trust assets, and they cannot create such an interest through assignment or sale. In any event, it is clear from the language of the trust deeds that the underlying rights claimants intend to sell for value are unvested, and contingent on the favorable exercise of the trustee's discretion. Per the deeds, the trustee has absolute discretion to exclude any beneficiaries-including claimants-from any end-of-trust-period trust. Deed I \u00b6 6(c) (when the trust period concludes, the trustee shall hold the assets in trust \"for such Beneficiaries and in such proportions or for one to the exclusion of the other or others and if more than one in such shares absolutely as the Trustees may ... appoint\"); Deed II \u00b6 6(c) (same). Because the trustee has the power to eliminate beneficiaries at its discretion,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Deed I \u00b6 9; Deed II \u00b6 9, it is also uncertain whether claimants will even be among the named beneficiaries at the end of the trust period. Hence, it is inconsistent with the terms of the trust deeds to characterize claimants' interest at termination as a \"present\" interest to which claimants are \"entitled.\" Claimants' interest in the Final Repository is no more certain-rather, it is contingent on the trustee not exhausting all of the assets during the trust period. And, as previously noted, the trustee \"shall not take into account\" any interest that members of the Final Repository might have during the life of the trusts. Deed I \u00b6 7(c); Deed II \u00b6 7(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The third and fourth rights can be addressed more quickly. With respect to the third right-to band together and terminate the trusts-claimants have acknowledged that, at the time their claims were filed and even now, this right is unavailable to them.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. of Oct. 26, 2017 Hr'g at 80:3-14; Tjio Dep. Tr. at 85:3-21. Thus, it cannot serve as the basis for standing.\n   <em>\n    Wheaton College v.

Cir. 2012) (\"[S]tanding is assessed at the time of filing ....\"). And the fourth right-claimants' ability to demand information and an accounting from the trustee-says nothing about whether claimants have any colorable interest in specific assets of the trust. After all, shareholders have the right to demand information about the corporations in which they invest, yet it is widely accepted, in Singapore and the United States, that they lack any interest in specific corporate property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Turning to the fifth asserted right, under the trust deeds claimants clearly have a right to be considered, in the exercise of the trustee's discretion, for distributions. The trustee has a fiduciary duty to act properly and reasonably in this regard. Tjio Decl. \u00b6 6. But the \"right to be considered as a potential recipient of benefit by the trustee[ ]\" \"is not a proprietary interest in the assets held by the trustee[ ] ....\"\n   <em>\n    JSC Mezhdunarodniy Promyshlenniy Bank v. Pugachev\n   </em>\n   , [2015] EWCA (Civ.) 139, [13] (Eng.), Ex. 10 to Pl.'s Reply [ECF No. 192-11].

Although Professor Tjio characterized this right as a proprietary interest, he readily acknowledged that it does not provide claimants with the right to enjoy, control, or possess the trust property, and that it does not constitute a vested interest in any specific trust assets.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tjio Dep.

Claimants have the right to be considered for distributions, subject to the exercise of the trustee's discretion and in conformance with the trustee's fiduciary duties. But this is not a proprietary right to specific assets; rather, it is an expectancy interest in the favorable exercise of discretion by the trustee. Claimants also have the right to bring suit against the trustee in Singapore to enforce the proper administration of the trusts.

But the claimant in\n   <em>\n    Tuthill Road\n   </em>\n   faced a different type of contingency than claimants do here. The value of his proceeds was contingent on the discretion of the trustee, while his interest in the proceeds was vested.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11179885\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/233/1017/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (\"[T]he fact remains that should the property be sold for any amount of money, that money is due to [the claimant].\"). Here, by contrast, whether or not claimants have any interest in the trust assets is contingent on the discretion of the trustee, and their status as beneficiaries does not provide them with any vested interest. Pl.'s Mot. to Strike at 16 (\"Claimants not only cannot say\n   <em>\n    how much\n   </em>\n   they will one day receive, they also cannot say-unlike the beneficiary in\n   <em>\n    Tuthill Road\n   </em>\n   -\n   <em>\n    whether\n   </em>\n   they will receive anything ....\"). Claimants, then, have a far weaker interest than did the claimant in\n   <em>\n    Tuthill Road\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Ultimately, whether claimants have a legally cognizable interest in the assets of these trusts is a close question, even under the forgiving standard that applies in the civil forfeiture context. Claimants-as the beneficiaries of discretionary trusts who have not been favored by the trustee-have a future, contingent interest in the trust assets, but they lack present rights to any specific trust property. In other contexts, courts have generally found such interests too hypothetical to create an actual case or controversy. Claimants have failed to provide the Court with any authority in which a claimant with a similar unvested, contingent interest in property was found to have standing to contest a forfeiture. The Court therefore concludes that claimants have failed to satisfy their burden of demonstrating standing by a preponderance of the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Whether Claimants Can Avoid the Doctrine of Corporate Separateness\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The government asserts that even if claimants could show that they have a legally cognizable interest in the trusts' assets, they would lack standing for an independent reason: \"it is undisputed and\n   indisputable that the Trusts' assets are\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   the Claimed Assets.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21. Instead, the trusts' assets consist entirely of shares of stock in the Blue Holdings Companies, and it is the Blue Holdings Companies that hold title to the claimed assets (i.e., the account portfolios). Claimants accuse the government of \"elevating form over substance\" and ignoring the \"overarching unified family trust structure.\" Cls.' Opp'n at 31-32. But the government did not create this \"multi-layered, interlocking trusts structure\" with separate corporate entities. Pl.'s Reply at 1. It simply seeks to have claimants \"honor and adhere to the forms and procedures commensurate with this freely-chosen design.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   To that end, it is undisputed that Singapore law, like U.S. law, recognizes the doctrine of corporate separateness. Cls.' Opp'n at 38; Tang Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 28-30; Tjio Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 21-22. Hence, shareholders of a Singapore company do not own or have any proprietary interest in the assets of that company. Tang Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 28-30; Tjio Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 3, 22. Claimants nonetheless contend that the doctrine of corporate separateness is \"merely the 'starting point,' \" and they present several arguments why it should be disregarded here. Cls.' Opp'n at 38 (quoting Tjio Decl. \u00b6 22).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   To start, claimants state that Singapore law \"leaves room 'for reverse veil piercing,' \" and \"other means to disregard the corporate form where it [is] rational and pragmatic to do so.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 39-40.

Cls.' Opp'n at 38 (quoting Tjio Decl. \u00b6 3). But whether or not Singapore courts would do so is immaterial-the relevant question is whether, under U.S. law, a shareholder has a sufficient \"financial interest\" in a corporation's assets to establish Article III standing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bank Julius Baer II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3834725\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/959/81/#p95\">\n    959 F.Supp.2d at 96\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
