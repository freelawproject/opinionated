Plaintiff James Thor Kirk was incarcerated at the time of filing and is proceeding pro se. For the following reasons, the Court will construe Kirk's Federal Habeas Corpus Petition liberally as a civil rights complaint under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and then dismiss the Complaint under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b) for failure to state a claim on which relief may be granted. Because Kirk has three or more strikes under the Prison Litigation Reform Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e (\"PLRA\"), he may not proceed on this action or in future actions in forma pauperis in the federal courts unless he \"is under imminent danger of serious physical injury.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201915\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   On August 22, 2017, Kirk filed the present Federal Habeas Corpus petition, which seeks to reopen \"case D-202-CV-198600516 for the purpose of investigation of the wrongful death of my father Edward Kevin Kirk.\" Complaint at 1. Kirk contends that he received $4,000.00 in compensation for his father's wrongful death and he asserts that amount \"to be injustice and inadequate compensation.\" Complaint at 1. Kirk seeks to reopen the civil case, an investigation into his father's wrongful death, and \"just financial compensation.\" Complaint at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Rule 4 of the Rules Governing Section 2254 cases provides for the dismissal of a habeas petition \"[i]f it plainly appears from the petition and any attached exhibits that the petitioner is not entitled to relief in the district court.\" Additionally, the Court has the discretion to dismiss sua sponte a civil action filed by a prisoner if it appears that the action is frivolous, malicious, or fails to state a claim on which relief may be granted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b).

Rather, Kirk challenges an unrelated civil proceeding's validity, alleging that he was denied adequate compensation in a 1986 wrongful death action filed in state court and seeking to reopen that action and be awarded additional compensation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint at 1.

Detention Ctr.\n   </em>\n   , No. CIV 14-00891 JCH\\SCY (D.N.M., October 17, 2014)(Doc. 9)(dismissing, under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201915\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(2)(B), Kirk's complaint). Title 28 of the United States Code, \u00a7 1915(g), provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   In no event shall a prisoner bring a civil action or appeal a judgment in a civil action or proceeding under this section if the prisoner has, on 3 or more prior occasions, while incarcerated or detained in any facility, brought an action or appeal in a court of the United States that was dismissed on the grounds that it is frivolous, malicious, or fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, unless the prisoner is under imminent danger of serious physical injury.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201915\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g). Kirk has accrued at least four strikes under \u00a7 1915(g) and, therefore, he can no longer proceed in forma pauperis in the federal courts unless he is \"under imminent danger of serious physical injury.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201915\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that: (i) the Prisoner's Motion And Affidavit For Leave To Proceed Pursuant\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201915\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , filed August 22, 2017 (Doc. 2), is denied; (ii) the Petitioner's Federal Habeas Corpus Petition, filed August 22, 2017 (Doc. 1), which the Court construes as a civil rights Complaint under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , is dismissed for failure to state a claim on which relief may be granted under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b), and all pending motions are denied as moot; and (iii) the Petitioner may not proceed in forma pauperis in a civil action or appeal a judgment in a civil action under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201915\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915\n   </extracted-citation>\n   unless he is\n   under imminent danger of serious physical injury.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-23\">\n    Section 1915(g) states that:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n    <em>\n     In no event\n    </em>\n    shall a prisoner bring a civil action or appeal a judgment in a civil action or proceeding under this section if the prisoner has, on 3 or more prior occasions, while incarcerated or detained in any facility, brought an action or appeal in a court of the United States that was dismissed on the grounds that it is frivolous, malicious, or fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, unless the prisoner is under imminent danger of serious physical injury.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-25\">\n    <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201915\">\n     28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (g) (emphasis added). Given the statute's plain language, the Court cannot grant Kirk's request to proceed in forma pauperis on this action, even though (i) there is no evidence that Kirk has been warned about \u00a7 1915(g)'s three-strikes rule, and (ii) Kirk originally filed his Complaint as a habeas corpus petition, and \u00a7 1915(g)'s three strikes rule does not apply to habeas corpus petitions. Any harm to Kirk by strict adherence to the three-strike rule is mitigated, however, by the reality that the Court is also dismissing the Petitioner's Federal Habeas Corpus Petition, which the Court construes as a civil rights Complaint under\n    <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , for failure to state a claim on which relief may be granted under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
