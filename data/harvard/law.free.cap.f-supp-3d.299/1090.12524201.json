PERRY, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Husband and wife plaintiffs, Michael and Robbin Dailey, seek damages and injunctive relief for radioactive contamination of their home allegedly caused by neighboring West Lake Landfill, located in North St. Louis County, Missouri. The Daileys assert that their property has been damaged by soil, dust, and air contamination from improper generation, handling, storage, and disposal of radioactive materials by six corporate defendants. The defendants consist of landfill owners and operators, and radioactive waste generators and disposers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The Daileys filed suit in St. Louis County Circuit Court, pleading various state-law tort theories. Defendants removed the action to this court arguing that the allegations arise under federal law-specifically the Price-Anderson Act (PAA) as amended in 1988,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202210\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2210\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   -which provides a federal compensation regime for damages resulting from a nuclear incident. After removal, the Daileys filed a motion to remand but later withdrew it and filed a First Amended Complaint with a PAA claim and various state-law tort claims. Now before the Court are defendants' multiple motions to dismiss the amended complaint. Defendants argue that the amended complaint fails to properly allege a claim under the PAA, that the Daileys' state-law claims are preempted by federal law, and that medical monitoring and emotional distress claims are not allowed here because no bodily injury is alleged. Defendant Mallinckrodt joins the other defendants' arguments for dismissal but also seeks dismissal of the amended complaint on the grounds that it fails to provide Mallinckrodt with fair notice, and it fails to plead a sufficient nexus between Mallinckrodt and the alleged damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Although the Eighth Circuit has not addressed the issue of PAA preemption of state-law claims, numerous other circuit courts have found that the PAA is the sole avenue for recovery when a public liability action for a nuclear incident is plead. I\n   agree. Therefore, the Daileys' state-law tort claims for nuisance and alternatively, for strict liability, shall be dismissed. However, the amended complaint withstands dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) as to the sufficiency of the pleading of a PAA claim and as to fair notice to defendant Mallinckrodt. But because the Daileys only allege property damage and not bodily injury, their requests for medical monitoring and emotional distress relief are not allowed under the PAA and will be stricken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   From 1942 to 1957, under contract with United States government organizations, defendant Mallinckrodt LLC processed natural uranium into various uranium compounds at a facility located in downtown St. Louis, Missouri. The processing was part of the Manhattan Project-a United States research project designed to develop the first nuclear weapons. The first step in the processing, called \"milling,\" generated a sandy waste material known as \"mill tailings,\" which contain radioactive decay products. In the late 1940's, the Manhattan Project acquired an additional tract of land near Lambert Airport-the St. Louis Airport Site (SLAPS)-for storage of mill tailings and other scrap waste from the uranium processing occurring at the downtown site.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Subsequently, some mill tailings were buried at SLAPS near Coldwater Creek and others were moved in the 1960's from SLAPS to a storage site on Latty Avenue in Hazelwood, Missouri. Around the same time, defendant Cotter Corporation purchased mill tailings from both SLAPS and Latty Avenue. Cotter eventually mixed the tailings with radioactively contaminated soil and sold the mixture as \"daily cover\" for landfill operations. In 1973, Cotter disposed of the daily cover mixture by dumping it at West Lake Landfill located in Bridgeton, Missouri. According to the Daileys, the Landfill was never an adequate storage or disposal site for radioactive waste, and therefore resulted in contamination of the surrounding communities. As of December 31, 2004, the Landfill stopped accepting waste and is now only used as a transfer station. The Landfill is currently under the regulation of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) pursuant to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In 1999, plaintiffs Michael and Robbin Dailey purchased a home on a parcel of real property located in Bridgeton, Missouri adjacent to the Landfill.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Daileys allege that their property is contaminated with radioactive material that has migrated over from the Landfill. Samples of soil from their yard, and dust from within their home, confirm a highly-elevated presence of radioactive particles. Trees in the vicinity of their property contain radiological and organic contamination. Air samples from their property are contaminated by radioactive Radon gas emissions and are frequently offensive in odor. Surface-water runoff that migrates to their property from the Landfill contains radioactive contamination. The Daileys allege that this off-site contamination also occurred from careless and reckless hauling of the radioactive waste, which resulted in spills during transport. In 2016, the Daileys learned of this radioactive waste contamination, which has resulted in the loss of use and enjoyment of their property and diminished their property value.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Daileys bring this suit against six defendants, who can be divided into two categories: (1) \"Landfill Defendants\" are owners and operators of the Landfill including defendants Bridgeton Landfill, LLC; Republic Services, Inc.; Allied Services, LLC; and Rock Road Industries, Inc., and (2) \"Radioactive Waste Defendants\" are waste generators and disposers including defendants Mallinckrodt LLC and Cotter Corporation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Mallinckrodt filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim based on Rules 8(a) and 12(b)(6), Fed. R. Civ. P., and also joined the motion to dismiss filed by the five other defendants. According to Mallinckrodt, the amended complaint: (1) fails to state a valid PAA claim in that it does not allege radiation exposure in excess of the federal dosage limits; (2) requires dismissal of state-law claims preempted by the PAA and federal law; and (3) fails to plead a plausible case for causation of damages by Mallinckrodt and fails to provide fair notice of the factual claims against Mallinckrodt. The other defendants join Mallinckrodt's first two arguments concerning preemption and standard of care, and also argue that medical monitoring and emotional damages are not recoverable under the PAA in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   This case is similar to many other cases that have been brought in this district by a neighbor of West Lake Landfill based on alleged odor and property contamination. Some of the previously-filed cases are still pending, and others have been dismissed after settlement. Some of the arguments before the court in these motions to dismiss were raised by the same defendants in earlier cases.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McClurg v.

According to the Daileys, the \"PAA statute cannot preempt conduct or circumstances that the statute does not cover in the first place\" because \"the PAA does not preempt state law claims for radioactive waste contamination that do[ ] not qualify as a 'nuclear incident' as that term is defined by the PAA.\" ECF No. 77 at 13.

There is no need to reexamine this issue here. Allowing state-law claims to proceed simultaneously with a PAA claim would create an obstacle to the accomplishment of the purpose and objective of the PAA. There is an irreconcilable conflict in allowing both the state-law and PAA claims to proceed simultaneously.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The Daileys cannot have their cake and eat it too. Although their initial petition filed in state court contained no PAA claim, after removal to this court, they amended their complaint to contain such a claim. Because the Daileys allege that defendants \"caused damage to Plaintiffs' property and/or the loss of use of the Plaintiffs' property which constitutes a 'nuclear incident' or series of 'nuclear incidents' under the Price Anderson Act,\" their amended complaint asserts a federal cause of action under the PAA that supplants all possible state causes of action.

The allegations of the amended complaint for both Count II (Permanent Nuisance) and Count III (Temporary Nuisance) assert that the defendants \"caused and contributed to the radioactive contamination of Plaintiffs' property\" which resulted in an \"unreasonable interference with Plaintiffs' use and enjoyment\" of their property. ECF No. 70 at \u00b6 104 p. 34, 107 p.35, 130-31. The Court notes that almost every paragraph of the amended complaint in these two state-law counts mentions the radioactive contamination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9988503\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/687/876/#p880\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 100-36 p.34-38.

According to defendants, the Daileys' PAA claim should be dismissed because they have \"failed to allege exposure to radiation exceeding the applicable Atomic Energy Commission (\"AEC\") or Nuclear Regulatory Commission (\"NRC\") radiation dose limits and have not identified any relevant federal nuclear safety standards that Defendants may have breached.\" ECF No. 72 at 9. Nuclear safety standards have changed over the years but under the current NRC (the AEC's successor) guidelines, the annual permissible dose limit for individual members of the general public exposed to radiation as a result of activities at NRC-licensed operations is not to exceed 0.1 rem (1mSv).\n   <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2020.1301\">\n    10 C.F.R. \u00a7 20.1301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   According to the amended complaint, the Daileys' property has been \"contaminated by radioactive material in amounts greater than allowed under federal safety regulations for unrestricted use\" and this has resulted in the Daileys being exposed to \"a dose in excess of the 15 millirem per year effective dose equivalent maximum dose limit for humans deemed to be protective by the EPA.\" ECF No. 70 at \u00b6 90-91.

The Daileys also contend that it is premature to decide the standard of care this early in the suit because application of a specific dosing limit is not required at this\n   stage of the litigation.

From 1942 to 1957, Mallinckrodt brought highly concentrated uranium containing high levels of radium from Africa into a facility in downtown St. Louis for uranium refinement. ECF No. 70 at \u00b6 1, 22, 36. Mallinckrodt was working as a private contractor processing uranium for the government's nuclear weapon development program.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 37. At its facility just west of the Mississippi River in downtown St. Louis, Mallinckrodt processed uranium by chemically milling the natural uranium ore to extract the uranium and create a yellow powder that could be processed into nuclear fuel. The waste product of the milling process was \"mill tailings\" which contained radioactive decay products and heavy metals.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 38. These mill tailings were transported by someone other than Mallinckrodt to various storage sites, eventually made their way into the Landfill, and contaminated the Daileys' adjoining property.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 42-70. The radioactive contamination found on the Daileys' property in the soil, dust, and Radon gas contain the same \"fingerprint,\" or chemical profile, as the uranium ore brought into St. Louis\n   from Africa by Mallinckrodt many years earlier.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 86, 94, 98.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In a public liability action under the PAA, the substantive rules for decision are derived from the law of state where the nuclear incident occurred, unless such law is inconsistent with federal law.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202014\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2014\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (hh). In this case, the Daileys allege tort liability based on temporary and permanent nuisance, or alternatively, strict liability. Missouri law recognizes both public and private nuisance.

These actions breached a duty of care to the Daileys and the public generally. Due in part to Mallinckrodt's negligent disposal of the radioactive waste, the Daileys' property is now contaminated. This contamination has resulted in a loss of use and enjoyment of the Daileys' property, and also a diminishment in property value. ECF No. 70 at \u00b6 112-24 p. 32-34.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   In evaluating a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, I do not weigh the factual allegations or determine their sufficiency or credibility at this stage of the litigation, I just construe them in favor of the Daileys. Although many of the allegations are directed at \"defendants\" generally, I find that there are sufficient factual allegations to state a PAA claim against Mallinckrodt. Missouri nuisance law does not require that Mallinckrodt be an owner of the offending property, which in this case is the Landfill. The Daileys have alleged a sufficient nexus to Mallinckrodt's processing of uranium by alleging that the radioactive contamination found on their property contains the same chemical fingerprint as the waste created by Mallinckrodt. I will deny Mallinckrodt's motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    VI. Medical Monitoring and Emotional Damages\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Finally, all defendants join in arguing that the Daileys' claims for medical monitoring and emotional damages are not cognizable under the PAA because they have not alleged any physical injury. The Daileys respond that it is premature to dismiss their medical monitoring claim as discovery will filter out which types of claims will ultimately go forward. However, they make no response to dismissal of an emotional damages claim in a PAA action. The Daileys also attempt to clarify that they are not seeking medical monitoring in the common sense but instead \"monitoring as a form of injunctive relief, as a remedy to the property nuisance they are\n   suffering\"-labeling it as \"environmental monitoring costs.\" ECF No. 77 at 32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Under 'Count II' of the amended complaint, the Daileys seek \"medical monitoring in the form of environmental testing, clean-up, and medical tests.\" ECF No. 70 \u00b6 112 p. 36. Traditionally, medical monitoring is done for the purpose of detecting the onset of disease. This understanding is consistent with the Daileys' request for \"medical tests.\" However, they also include \"environmental testing\" and \"clean-up\" in their medical monitoring claim. To the extent that the Daileys seek medical monitoring, i.e. medical testing, in regards to their claim for property damage under the PAA, this claim is dismissed because there are no allegations of bodily injury.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Berg Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9419471\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/293/1127/#p1132\">\n    293 F.3d at 1132-33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that a medical monitoring claim lacks the jurisdictional requirements of the PAA when there is only future risk of disease but no present physical injury). The Daileys fail to respond to defendants' argument concerning emotional damages. Regardless, I agree with defendants that an emotional distress claim without alleged physical injury also fails under the PAA.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9419471\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/293/1127/#p1132\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9419471\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/293/1127/#p1132\">\n    at 1130-32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (statutory language, legislative history, and case law all support the conclusion that the PAA requires bodily injury for an emotional distress claim).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Conclusion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The Price-Anderson Act is the sole means for relief when a public liability action for a nuclear incident is plead-as the Daileys have done here. The federal PAA claim preempts all state-law claims brought based on the same factual allegations. The Daileys' state tort claims in Counts II through IV of the amended complaint will be dismissed. The amended complaint does, however, plead the basic elements of a public liability action sufficient to survive dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6). Although the amended complaint does not allege violations of the NRC's radiation exposure limits for individual members of the public as mandated for licensed facilities, the Daileys have stated sufficient allegations for a property damage claim under the PAA to survive dismissal. Their allegations against defendant Mallinckrodt are adequate to state a valid claim based on Missouri tort liability, and provide fair notice. Finally, because the Daileys have only alleged property damage and not bodily injury, their medical monitoring and emotional distress claims are not allowable under the PAA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Accordingly,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS HEREBY ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that defendant Mallinckrodt LLC's motion to dismiss [# 71] and defendants Allied Services LLC, Bridgeton Landfill LLC, Cotter Corporation, Republic Services Inc., and Rock Road Industries, Inc.'s motion to dismiss [# 72] are\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED in part and DENIED in part\n   </strong>\n   .
