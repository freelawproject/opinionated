INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff Jean-Gabriel Bernier, a federal prisoner, brought this action against the Federal Defendants\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   alleging, among other things, that the Federal Bureau of Prisons violated his Eighth Amendment right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment by refusing to prescribe him the drug Harvoni to treat his Hepatitis C. The court previously dismissed Plaintiff's\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   claims for money damages on qualified immunity grounds, but allowed his claim seeking injunctive relief in the form of Harvoni treatment to move forward.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This matter is before the court on the Federal Defendants' Motion to Dismiss the remaining claim for injunctive relief as moot, and Plaintiff's Motion for Reconsideration of the court's dismissal of his damages claim against Defendant Allen, Chief Physician of the Federal Bureau of Prisons. For the reasons discussed below, the Federal Defendants' Motion to Dismiss is granted and Plaintiff's Motion for Reconsideration is granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Defendants sought dismissal on multiple grounds, but the court's opinion focused on only two. First, Defendants sought dismissal of Plaintiff's Eighth Amendment claim for injunctive relief, asserted against Defendants in their official capacities, for failure to state a claim.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267521\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/242/31/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 40 ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 1-7, 45-46;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 16 (requesting that the BOP Director direct Defendant Allen to approve Plaintiff's treatment with Harvoni). The court, however, found that Plaintiff had stated a cognizable claim under the Eighth Amendment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bernier\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267521\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/242/31/\">\n    242 F.Supp.3d at 40-41\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Specifically, after concluding that Plaintiff had sufficiently alleged a serious medical need, the court found the following allegations \"more than adequate\" to satisfy the Rule 8(a) pleading standard with respect to Defendants' deliberate indifference to Plaintiff's serious medical need:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that the BOP has violated its own policies and the standard of care in the medical profession by ignoring test results-his FibroSure scores from 2012, 2014, and 2015-indicating he has cirrhosis that requires treatment with Harvoni. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 13, 15, 18-19. The BOP's exclusive reliance on APRI scores and old biopsy results to deny him Harvoni, he further contends, is not premised on valid medical criteria, but instead driven by \"avoiding the costs of the Harvoni treatment by denying mostly all prisoners who presently suffer from Hep[atitis] C.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25. Plaintiff posits that if he were to receive Harvoni now, then \"the liver damage already done to the liver will most likely be reversed and the painful [symptoms] which he Plaintiff suffers as a result of the present liver damage will cease to exist.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 41 (first alteration in original).

The court held:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   Plaintiff's\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   claims are easily dismissed on the second prong of the qualified immunity test because the rights Plaintiff claims were violated were not clearly established at the time the alleged violations occurred. Plaintiff has cited no binding case, and the court is aware of none, holding that denying a prisoner Harvoni to treat Hepatitis C based only on his APRI score violates the Eighth Amendment ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267521\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/242/31/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267521\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/242/31/\">\n    at 39\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . So, in summary, following Defendants' initial motion to dismiss, the court\n   permitted Plaintiff to proceed with his Eighth Amendment claim for injunctive relief, but dismissed his\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   claim for damages against Defendant Allen.

If Plaintiff intends to continue to pursue his\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   claim against Defendant Allen, he shall do so in one of two ways. Plaintiff must either: (1) file and serve an amended complaint, or (2) serve the original complaint and, within 21 days of service, submit a more definite statement under Rule 12(e).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Momenian v.

The amended complaint or more definite statement should set forth with greater specificity, to the extent known, (1) the time, place, and personnel involved in Plaintiff's institutional testing and treatment for Hepatitis C ; (2) the institutional personnel involved in making a recommendation regarding treatment with Harvoni and their recommendations; (3) the BOP approval process for receiving Harvoni treatment; and (4) Defendant Allen's role in denying treatment with Harvoni. The court requires these additional factual allegations to make an informed determination about the qualified immunity question should Defendant Allen once more raise\n   that defense as a ground for dismissal. Additionally, in preparing his supplemental pleading, Plaintiff shall take into account recent developments in the case, including Plaintiff's treatment with Zepatier and the fact of BOP's policy change regarding prisoner priority levels for Hepatitis C treatment, as those events might bear upon the required showing of \"deliberate indifference\" given \"the rapidly evolving legal and medical developments in this area.\"\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cunningham v.
