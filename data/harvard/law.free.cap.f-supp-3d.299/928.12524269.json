Graff (\"Graff\" or \"Plaintiff\") sued Defendants Leslie Hindman Auctioneers, Inc. (\"Hindman\"); Biltmore Loan and Jewelry-Scottsdale, LLC (\"Biltmore\"); The Owings Gallery, Inc. (\"Gallery\"); Nathaniel O. Owings (\"Owings\"); Ray Harvey (\"Harvey\"); and Unknown Defendants 1-3 (collectively, \"Defendants\") in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois. (R. 1-1.) Defendant Harvey removed the case to federal court. (R. 1.) Before the Court is Plaintiff Graff's motion for remand. (R. 13.) Defendant Harvey opposes the motion. (R. 26.) For the following reasons, the Court denies 1) Plaintiff's motion for remand and 2) Plaintiff's request (and Defendant's counter request) for attorneys' fees and costs associated with the removal/remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff Graff brings this suit to recover allegedly stolen and pawned paintings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff claims that Deborah Graff, a woman he was divorcing at the time, stole three pieces of \"Western American art\" from his Dallas home. (R. 1-1 at \u00b6 16, 21.) Plaintiff further alleges that Deborah Graff pawned the three paintings with Biltmore and then failed to pay back the loan secured with the paintings. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 21-22, 31.) The paintings changed hands from Biltmore to Hindman, who sold two of the three paintings at an auction in September 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 22-23.) Gallery, Owings, and Harvey, among others, bought one of the paintings as a group. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 25.) These parties, as well as the other current owners of the paintings, have either refused to return the paintings to Plaintiff or Plaintiff has been unable to contact them on account of not knowing their identity. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 24, 30, 32.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff Graff filed this lawsuit in the Circuit Court of Cook County on August 25, 2017. (R. 1-1; R. 15 at 1.) On the same day, Plaintiff requested issuance of a summons for each Defendant and summonses were issued on August 25, 2017. (R. 15 at 2.) One business day after the summonses were issued, on August 28, 2017, Plaintiff sent a copy of the complaint and each summons to the appropriate sheriffs' offices for service on the Defendants, as suggested by Illinois statute 735 ILCS 5/2-202(a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2, 12-15.) The sheriffs began serving the Defendants, including Harvey and Hindman. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3.) The sheriff served Defendant Harvey on September 7, 2017, and Harvey filed his notice of removal on September 19, 2017. (R. 1; R. 26 at 4-5; R. 15 at 2-3.) Defendant Hindman was served on September 21, 2017. (R. 26 at 5; R. 15 at 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff Graff now moves to remand the case back to the Circuit Court of Cook County, and also moves for attorneys' fees and costs associated with the improper removal. (R. 13.) Defendant Harvey opposes the motion and also requests its own attorneys' fees and costs.
