The Airline sponsored an employee benefit plan, Defendant American Airlines, Inc. Pilot Long-Term Disability Plan (the \"Plan), administered by the Pension Benefits Administrative Committee (the \"Plan Administrator\"). Vetter stopped working in January, 2012 due to health problems including fatigue, depression, and severe stomach pains. Administrative Record (\"AR\") 164-65, ECF No. 21. She took sick leave through February 21, 2012, then applied for long-term disability benefits pursuant to the Plan in April 2012. AR 60, 118. The Plan Administrator initially denied the benefits on July 31, 2012. AR 158-62. On appeal, it awarded her benefits of $12,795.79 for the period from May 3, 2012 through July 23, 2012, but determined that benefits were not appropriate after July 23, 2012 because Vetter no longer was disabled. AR 57-69. It did not address benefits between February 22, 2012, when Vetter stopped receiving pay, and May 3, 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In this action, filed pursuant to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (\"ERISA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201132\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , Vetter challenges the denial of benefits for the periods from February 22, 2012 until May 3, 2012, and July 23, 2012 until she returned to work on October 1, 2013.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl., ECF No. 1; Pl.'s Reply &amp; Opp'n 1 n.1, ECF No. 29.

I find that the Plan's decision not to award benefits before May 3, 2012 or after July 23, 2012 was not supported by substantial evidence, but also that the onset and duration of Vetter's disability are not clear on the record before me. Therefore, I will deny the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment, and remand the case to the Plan Administrator for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Pursuant to agreements that the Airline entered into with the Allied Pilots Association (\"APA,\" the union that represents Vetter and other pilots), the Airline provides, administers and funds the Plan, which provides long-term disability benefits for eligible pilots.

The Plan defines \"disability\" or \"disabled\" as \"an illness or injury, verified through a qualified medical authority in accordance with Section V of the Plan, which prevents a Pilot Employee from continuing to act as an Active Pilot Employee in the Service of the Employer,\" with exceptions not relevant here.

According to Vetter, her condition worsened in summer 2012 and she \"started suffering symptoms similar to Bells Palsy.\" Vetter Decl., AR 165. In her January 28, 2013 Declaration, Vetter stated that she recently was diagnosed with Lyme disease and that two physicians, Dr. Kessler and Dr. Corrigan, found that she was \"ineligible to fly due to a medical condition and w[ould] not be eligible until [her] illness resolve[d].\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201132\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201132\">\n    at 164, 165\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . On appeal, the Plan approved Vetter for long-term disability benefits \"because of [her] medical inability to act as a Pilot\" due to \"her claimed condition of insomnia,\" but only for the period May 3, 2012 through July 23, 2012. Sept. 25, 2013 Ltr., AR 52; Aug. 12, 2013 Ltr., AR 57.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Thus, it is undisputed that Vetter had a qualifying disability from May 3, 2012 until July 23, 2012. Therefore, the issue is whether the Plan abused its discretion in finding that Vetter's disability did not exist prior to May 3, 2012 and ceased to exist after July 23, 2012. A disability \"exist[s]\" and \"continue[s] to exist[ ] only if the Pilot Employee has received and continues to receive qualified medical care consistent with the nature of the illness or injury that gives rise to such Disability.\" Plan \u00a7 V.A, AR 138. A disability \"cease[s] to exist\" for purposes of the Plan \"if (1) health is restored so as not to prevent the Pilot Employee from acting as an Active Pilot Employee in the service of the [Airline], (2) verification of such Disability can no longer be established or (3) appropriate medical care is wantonly disregarded by such Pilot Employee.\" Plan \u00a7 V.B, AR 138.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Plan provides that \"[a]ny dispute as to the clinical validity of a Pilot Employee's claim of the existence of a Disability or the continuation of the illness or injury which gave rise to such Disability shall be referred to a clinical authority selected under the Agreements\" between the Airline and the APA, \"and the findings of such authority regarding the nature and extent of such illness or injury shall be final and binding upon the [Airline], the [APA] and the Pilot Employee....\" Plan \u00a7 V.D, AR 138.
