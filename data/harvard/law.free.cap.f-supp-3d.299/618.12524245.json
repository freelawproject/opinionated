RAMBO, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiff Walter Rodriguez, a federal inmate formerly incarcerated at the minimum-security\n   Federal Prison Camp at the United States Penitentiary in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania (\"USP-Lewisburg\"), initiated this action against several Bureau of Prisons (\"BOP\") officials\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   with a\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   -styled complaint on October 18, 2012, as amended on July 9, 2014, and as supplemented on August 19, 2014 and September 15, 2014. (Docs. 105, 138, 146-1.) In the amended complaint, Plaintiff alleges that his constitutional rights were violated in connection with a physical and verbal assault by Defendant PA Potter and subsequent medical care; that several Defendants subsequently retaliated against him after it was discovered that he wished to pursue legal action against Defendants; and, that he was subjected unconstitutional conditions of confinement in his restricted confinement cell.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Presently before the court are four motions for summary judgment, filed by Defendants. (Docs. 216, 223, 228, 234.) For the reasons set forth below, the motions for summary judgment will be granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Facts\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   For purposes of addressing the motions for summary judgment, the court will set forth the allegations in the amended complaint, along with any factual disputes between the parties as set forth in the filed statements of material facts. All the events in the amended complaint occurred at various security level facilities at Plaintiff's former place of confinement, USP-Lewisburg.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff is a chronic care inmate suffering from chronic diabetes and \"other chronic ailments.\" (Doc. 105 \u00b6 71; Doc. 217 \u00b6 2; Doc. 229 \u00b6 2.) Plaintiff requires insulin and monitoring to treat his diabetes. (Doc. 105 \u00b6 71.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On August 11, 2012, between approximately 9:15 and 9:30 p.m., while located at a unit at the Federal Prison Camp in Lewisburg, Plaintiff started to feel sick, lightheaded, nauseous, dizzy, weak, and disoriented. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14.) He thought he was going to faint. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) As a result, he approached Correctional Officer (\"CO\") Ross\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   at the Office Station and asked him to call the paramedics. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15.) CO Ross opened the medical room for Plaintiff and allowed him to check his blood sugar level with a glucometer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The blood sugar level read \"high,\" or over 500. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff asserts that the normal range is between 90 and 110. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   CO Ross called Defendant PA Potter, who was located at the Lewisburg Penitentiary at the time, to inform him of Plaintiff's\n   condition.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16.) According to Plaintiff, PA Potter \"showed reluctance\" to travel to Plaintiff at the Camp, and instead instructed Plaintiff to drink water and return to bed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff then returned to his unit. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Later, when CO Ross and Defendant CO Eichner came to the unit to perform the inmate count, CO Ross called in a \"medical emergency\" for Plaintiff. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17.) Two inmates assisted Plaintiff to the medical room at the Camp's Administration Building, where Plaintiff laid down on a medical bed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) CO Eichner remained in the room with Plaintiff until PA Potter and Defendant Lieutenant Knapp arrived. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Fifteen (15) minutes after CO Ross called in the \"medical emergency,\" and approximately twenty-five (25) minutes after Plaintiff first notified CO Ross about his condition, PA Potter and Lieutenant Knapp arrived at the medical room. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Upon arriving at the medical room, PA Potter yelled, \"What the f*** am I here for? What the f*** you expect me to do?\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18.) Plaintiff responded, \"help me.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) PA Potter then asked Plaintiff to extend his left arm in order to \"finger stick\" him. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19.) After Plaintiff did this, PA Potter grabbed Plaintiff's wrist and threw his arm back aggressively.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) PA Potter then prepared a syringe and injected Plaintiff \"with force,\" causing pain to Plaintiff. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20.) PA Potter then grabbed Plaintiff by his shirt and pulled him to a sitting position. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff asserts that he feared for his safety and physical well-being and believed PA Potter would strike him. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21.) When Plaintiff stood up, PA Potter struck him on the back of his neck and shoved him forward, causing further pain to Plaintiff. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22.) PA Potter cursed at Plaintiff, \"Get the f**k out of my office,\" and pushed Plaintiff out of the room. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   After he left the office and was staggering down the hallway, Plaintiff heard PA Potter asking CO Eichner, \"Where did he go? Where did he go?\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24.) PA Potter then threw a sandwich at Plaintiff that struck him on his back as he walked down the hallway. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25.) Plaintiff claims that CO Eichner and Lieutenant Knapp witnessed these events and did not intervene at any point.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26.) Plaintiff also avers that PA Potter never monitored or followed up with Plaintiff's condition after treatment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   During his deposition taken in connection with this litigation, Plaintiff testified that he does not remember how long the entire incident on August 11, 2012 lasted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   (Doc. 225-1 at 16; 42-43.) He testified that Defendant Knapp was in the room for the entire incident, standing at the foot of Plaintiff's bed at the time, but Defendant Knapp did not touch him, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 76-77), nor did Plaintiff complain to Defendant Knapp, (Doc. 249 at 9 \u00b6 7). Plaintiff could not remember if Defendant Knapp spoke to him at all. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 77.) Plaintiff also admits that, since the incident, he has had no contact with Defendant Knapp and that Defendant Knapp is not responsible for any of his injuries. (Doc. 249 at 9 \u00b6 13.) As to Defendant Eichner, Plaintiff testified that he remained by the door during the incident, and could not remember if he stepped out of the room at any time. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 79.) Plaintiff also testified that, as a result of the incident with Defendant PA Potter, he did not bleed, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 42); he did not remember if he was bruised, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ); he did not fall to the ground when struck and shoved by Potter (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ); and, he was not injured when struck with the sandwich, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ). (\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 217 \u00b6\u00b6 13-15, 18; Doc. 224 \u00b6 4.) Further, Plaintiff stated that he never treated with a physician for a physical or mental injury resulting from the incident. (Doc. 225-1 at 45-46;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 217 \u00b6 19; Doc. 224 \u00b6 4; Doc. 235 \u00b6 15.) In addition, Plaintiff has never been diagnosed with a physical or mental condition as a result of this incident. (Doc. 225-1 at 46;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 217 \u00b6 20; Doc. 224 \u00b6 5.) In Plaintiff's counter statement of material facts, he now asserts that he asked for medical and psychological help afterwards, but was denied assistance and, instead, was sent to a restricted housing unit at USP-Lewisburg, or the \"SHU.\" (Doc. 249 at 4, 6, 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   After the August 11, 2012 incident, on the same night between approximately 9:50 p.m. and 10:05 p.m., Plaintiff called his brother, Pablo Rodriguez, to tell him about the incident with PA Potter and ask that he search for an attorney for legal advice. (Doc. 105 \u00b6 30.) Plaintiff also told his brother that he planned to write everything down in detail and mail the account to him for use by an attorney. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff avers that it is BOP policy to monitor and record telephone calls. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The next morning, August 12, 2012, Plaintiff went to the medical department to get his insulin shot and notified the PA on duty that he was having pain in the back of his neck. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31.) Plaintiff asked for painkillers, but was told to buy aspirin from commissary instead. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) He was not further treated for his neck pain. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff saw a Correctional Officer Wagner at his cell when he returned from medical and told her about his distress over his condition. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On August 13, 2012, at 3:55 p.m., Plaintiff went to see the facility's psychologist, Dr. Banks, to seek help for depression and emotional distress. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31.) Plaintiff avers that he was still in shock and was suffering from nightmares and panic attacks. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Two days after Plaintiff placed the telephone call to his brother, on August 14, 2012, at approximately 8:00 a.m., a correctional officer arrived at Plaintiff's prison workplace, Unicor Recycling, and detained him. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32.) Plaintiff was separated from general population and placed in administrative detention in USP-Lewisburg's SHU. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff avers that Defendant SIS Agent Fosnot made this decision and specifically placed Plaintiff in \"G\" block, which holds gang members and violent inmates. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff further asserts that he was \"distressed\" about the move to the SHU because he knew PA Potter worked there. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Once Plaintiff arrived at the SHU, he was placed in a temporary cell and interviewed by Agent Fosnot and a psychologist. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35.) Plaintiff told them about the incident with PA Potter and about his health issues. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) At the end of the interview,\n   Agent Fosnot told Plaintiff, \"it sucks to be you now.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff was then placed in an SHU cell. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) At his deposition, Plaintiff testified that Agent Fosnot told him that, rather than return him to the Camp, he was placing Plaintiff in the SHU cell \"for [his] own security.\" (Doc. 225-1 at 56.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On August 18, 2012, Defendant PA McClintock approached Plaintiff in the SHU and told him that Plaintiff would be staying in the SHU program for eighteen (18) months. (Doc. 105 \u00b6 36.) Before walking away, PA McClintock laughed and said, \"Potter will see you soon.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Further, each time PA McClintock came to Plaintiff's SHU cell to administer Plaintiff's insulin and other medication,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   he told Plaintiff, \"this is your new home for the next 18 months.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38.) Plaintiff asserts that, because he did not trust PA McClintock with his medication and feared harm, he refused to take his medication. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39.) However, on approximately four (4) occasions, Plaintiff took insulin and other medication from a correctional officer he did not recognize. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40.) A PA was present on these occasions, apparently shielded from Plaintiff's view by the cell door, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. 225-1 at 62), and Plaintiff eventually discovered that the PA was PA Potter, (Doc. 105 \u00b6 40). This discovery caused distress for Plaintiff, including extreme headaches. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On September 12, 2012, at approximately 7:00 p.m., PA Potter called Plaintiff a \"dumb a**.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43.) In addition, Plaintiff discovered that PA Potter was preparing his insulin and other medication.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Because Plaintiff feared for his life, when PA Potter would give him the insulin syringe, Plaintiff would pretend to inject himself with it, but instead would empty it into the air. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) He also kept his pills under his tongue in order to spit them out later. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On September 16, 2012, Plaintiff wrote complaints to Defendants Lieutenant Hult and Warden Thomas, expressing his concerns over being approached by PA Potter, but these complaints were ignored. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 45.) Warden Thomas counters that, complaints such as those made by Plaintiff, are not typically ignored; rather, Defendant Thomas refers all complaints for investigation to the SIS. (Doc. 235 \u00b6 9.) In his counter statement of material facts, Plaintiff adds that Warden Thomas is briefed about the complaint first, signs a report, and then forwards it for investigation. (Doc. 249 at 8 \u00b6 9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On September 27, 2012, after PA McClintock heard that Plaintiff was suing him, he threatened Plaintiff with a \"you wanna play games\" statement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. 105 \u00b6 37.) The following morning, Plaintiff asked Defendant CO Crawley to turn off the light in his SHU cell because he had headaches and could not sleep. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 48.) CO Crawley responded, \"suck it up, and next time don't come to the SHU,\" and refused to turn off the light. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) He also denied Plaintiff a shower. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) On October 3, 2012, CO Crawley again denied Plaintiff a shower. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 50.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On October 20, 2012, Plaintiff told a psychologist at his SHU cell that he could\n   not sleep due to the bright lights being on all day and night, and that he was having constant headaches and severe depression. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 49.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   On October 23, 2012, after seventy (70) days of confinement in the SHU, Agent Fosnot came to Plaintiff's cell to take a statement and told Plaintiff, \"You shouldn't be here.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 51.) Two days later, on October 25, 2012, Plaintiff was taken to an outside doctor's appointment, but the correctional officer escorting him teased him, saying, \"watch it, watch it, here comes PA Potter,\" and, \"it is a good thing we don't have cameras in this area.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 52.) The CO also told Plaintiff, \"If you were at the Camp you would not have to put up with being handcuffed and shackled.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 53.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On November 15, 2012, Agent Fosnot transferred Plaintiff to USP-Allenwood's SHU without informing Plaintiff of the SIS investigation findings. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 55.) Plaintiff remained in restricted confinement, segregated from general population. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 61.) Subsequently, on January 22, 2013, Plaintiff was transferred to FCI-Schuylkill's Medium Facility SHU, where he remained in restricted confinement and segregated from general population. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 62.) Once there, Plaintiff was evaluated by a psychologist and he told her about his previous SHU confinement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 63.) Thereafter, on January 25, 2013, Plaintiff was released to the FCI-Schuylkill's Camp general population. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 64.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In addition to providing the aforementioned chronological background with respect to his confinement in the SHU, Plaintiff also asserts the following facts with respect to the conditions of his confinement there. While confined in USP-Lewisburg's SHU, Plaintiff was locked down 24/7, with two cell mates in a six (6) by nine (9) foot cell. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 57.) The cell always held three (3) inmates, despite availability in other cells. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 58.) Plaintiff was provided with no recreation, nor was he permitted to go to the law library. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 57.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Plaintiff and his cell mates were never provided with a mop or broom to clean the cell, and paint was peeling from the ceiling. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 59.) The cell's toilet would clog with fecal matter and toilet paper for days. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In addition, the cell was infested with cockroaches and mice. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) It was also extremely hot, causing Plaintiff to feel thirsty and dehydrated. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff does not indicate how he attempted to grieve these conditions to prison staff, other than to simply state that he complained to correctional officers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Overall, Plaintiff asserts that he was subjected to a total of 165 days in restricted confinement, 91 of which were in USP-Lewisburg's SHU, in retaliation for what prison officials overheard in Plaintiff's telephone conversation with his brother following the incident with PA Potter and for \"denouncing the physical and verbal assault inflicted to him by PA Potter.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 65.) He terms his treatment in the SHU as a \"campaign of harassment.\" (Doc. 225-1 at 59.) He further asserts that, prior to being placed in restricted confinement, he had a job with Unicor Industries, was participating in institutional educational programs, was regularly attending religious services, and was taking college correspondence classes. (Doc. 105 \u00b6 66.) These activities, as well as his general support network, were interrupted by his retaliatory restrictive confinement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Procedural History\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Plaintiff initiated this civil action with a complaint filed on October 18, 2012. (Doc. 1.) However, by order dated May 13, 2014, the court granted Plaintiff's motion for leave to file an amended complaint. (Doc. 95.) The amended complaint was filed on July 9, 2014, (Doc. 105), and supplemented\n   on August 19, 2014, (Doc. 138), and September 15, 2014, (Doc. 146-1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Defendants filed motions to dismiss the amended complaint. (Docs. 107 &amp; 129.) In a memorandum and order issued on March 31, 2015, the court granted in part and denied in part the motions to dismiss. (Docs. 174 &amp; 175.) Specifically, Plaintiff's Eighth Amendment claim of deliberate indifference to his medical needs was dismissed, and the following claims were permitted to proceed: (1) an Eighth Amendment claim of excessive use of force against Defendant PA Potter; (2) Eighth Amendment failure to protect/failure to intervene claims against BOP Defendants; (3) Eighth Amendment conditions of confinement claims against all Defendants; (4) an access to the courts claim against Defendant Fosnot; and (5) a retaliation claim against all Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Defendants have now filed motions for summary judgment, seeking judgment in their favor as to all these claims. (Docs. 216, 223, 228, 234.) Responsive and reply briefings have been filed. Thus, the motions for summary judgment are ripe for disposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Standard of Review\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56 sets forth the standard and procedures for granting a motion for summary judgment.

In Defendant PA Potter's motion, he argues that summary judgment should be granted in his favor on the following grounds: (1) Plaintiff's allegations, even if true, do not support a claim against PA Potter for use of excessive force; and (2) there are no facts in the record to support Plaintiff's claims of conditions of confinement and retaliation against PA Potter, as Plaintiff has not shown any personal involvement by Potter in these claims. In Defendant Eichner's motion, he argues that summary judgment should be granted in his favor on the following grounds: (1) because Plaintiff's allegations of excessive force against PA Potter do not rise to the level of a constitutional violation, Plaintiff's claims for failure to protect/failure to intervene against Defendant Eichner, made in connection with the excessive force claim, must fail; (2) assuming,\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   , that Plaintiff has established the excessive force claim against PA Potter, there is no evidence that Defendant Eichner had a realistic and reasonable opportunity to intervene; and (3) there is no evidence that Defendant Eichner had any personal involvement with regard to the conditions of confinement and retaliation claims. In Defendant Knapp's motion, he argues that summary judgment should be granted in his favor because: (1) Plaintiff has made no allegations in support of claims of failure to protect/failure to intervene with respect to Defendant Knapp's actions in the medical room on August 11, 2012; and (2) there is no evidence that Defendant Knapp had any personal involvement with regard to the conditions of confinement and retaliation claims. In BOP Defendants' motion, they argue that summary judgment should be entered in their favor on the following grounds: (1) Plaintiff has failed to produce sufficient evidence in support of claims of failure to protect/failure to intervene against any of the BOP Defendants; (2) Plaintiff's conditions of confinement claims do not rise to the level of a constitutional violation; (3) Plaintiff has failed to establish an access to the courts claim against Defendant Fosnot; (4) Plaintiff has failed to establish a retaliation claim against BOP Defendants; and (5) Plaintiff has failed to establish a due process claim against Defendant Fosnot. The court will discuss the lack of personal involvement of the Defendants with respect to Plaintiff's claims first, followed by a discussion of the merits of the claims as they relate to the remaining relevant Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Personal Involvement\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   A\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   civil rights action under \u00a7 1331 has the same standards as does a \u00a7 1983 civil rights action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Paton v.

It is clear from the record that Plaintiff is not alleging that any of the other Defendants are personally involved in this excessive use of force claim. Turning to the failure to protect/failure to intervene claims related to this same August 11, 2012 incident, the record also reveals that Defendants Thomas, McClintock, Crawley, and Fosnot were nowhere near the event at the time, and therefore had no opportunity or ability to intervene or provide protection to Plaintiff. Further, to the extent that Plaintiff asserts this claim against Defendant Warden Thomas, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. 105 at 15 \u00b6 89), the claim, in essence, is nothing more than an assertion of\n   <em>\n    respondeat superior\n   </em>\n   liability which seeks to hold the Warden liable based on his supervisory role.

Further, Defendants Eichner and Knapp claim that Plaintiff acknowledged at his deposition that he is not asserting his conditions of confinement and retaliation claims against them. (Docs. 225 at 13; Doc. 230 at 15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Addressing Defendants Eichner and Knapp's personal involvement first, the court notes that, in response to the argument regarding Plaintiff's deposition statements, Plaintiff generally asserts that \"some\" of his answers at his deposition were \"defective,\" and that \"questions were vague and not specific and at time[s] confusing, and thus jeopardized the defense of the Plaintiff.\" (Doc. 247 at 6.) While Plaintiff's response may raise the possibility of disputed facts here, a careful review of the amended complaint confirms that Plaintiff does not allege that either Defendants Eichner or Knapp was personally involved in: (1) the decision to place Plaintiff in the SHU in retaliation for his seeking legal\n   action against them after the August 11, 2012 incident, or (2) subjecting him to the unconstitutional conditions of confinement in the SHU. Plaintiff has failed to offer any evidence disputing the lack of personal involvement by these Defendants.

That I responded with Lieutenant Knapp and inmate Rodriguez was walking into the exam room. That inmate Rodriguez then laid down on the bed and became unconscious. After the inmate did not respond to verbal stimuli, I then used mild painful stimuli, which is a technique used for an unresponsive inmate and squeezed his finger approximately two times. That I remember talking to inmate Rodriguez and asking him if he was alright but I don't believe I ever cursed at him by saying \"fuck.\" That I didn't jam the needle into Rodriguez's arm, I just gave him a shot like I normally do. That after I gave him the shot, inmate Rodriguez sat up on his own and then started to fall over so I reached down and grabbed him where the shoulder meets the neck. I never slapped him. That I then told him he was done and to have a good day and Rodriguez walked out of the office. I never told him to \"get the fuck out of the office.\" That I then got him a diabetic sandwich and I was about 4 feet away from him and I underhand tossed the sandwich to Rodriguez.

That Potter grabbed inmate Rodriguez's fingers and forcibly pulled them apart because he wasn't responding to his questions. I saw no medical reason for why Potter would do this. That when Potter injected inmate Rodriguez, he jammed it into his arm with what I would call unnecessary force. That although Lieutenant Knapp was in the area, he spent most of the time in the hallway and it is very possible he did not witness much of the incident and I'm not sure what he may have seen. That after the injection, Potter slapped the back of inmate Rodriguez's neck and I remember this because I could hear the slap on the back of his neck. At this point, Potter did not even allow enough time for the injection to take effect, so I would not say it was Potter just trying to help him up in a medical way. That Potter then proceeded to pick him up by the back of the neck and then he pushed him out of the exam room. That at this point, I did hear Potter say, \"Now get the fuck out of my office\" and as inmate Rodriguez was leaving the area, he was literally crying.... I never saw Potter throw a sandwich at the inmate.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 57-58.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Defendant Knapp asserted in his affidavit, in part, the following recollection of the incident:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   That Potter started asking inmate Rodriguez questions and he was unresponsive.

That Potter then took his blood glucose testing and inmate Rodriguez just continued to lay there and moan. At no time did I observe Potter use any force on inmate Rodriguez and after he took his glucose reading, Potter then gave him an injection to his upper arm. That Potter then told inmate Rodriguez he was done with him and he could return to his unit. Inmate Rodriguez\n   still sat there slumped over and moaning. It was at this time, Potter put his hand under his arm and his other hand around the back of his neck and assisted him to a sitting and then standing position. That in my opinion what Potter did was help the inmate get to his feet after being issued medication in order to assist him and at no time did I ever consider it to be any type of use of force on inmate Rodriguez. That at this point, Potter did tell inmate Rodriguez to get the fuck out of the office. That I never saw Potter throw a sandwich at the inmate.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 60-61.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Plaintiff made the following assertions in his affidavit:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   That Potter began cussing at me by saying, \"What the fuck am I here for, what do you expect me to do.\" Office Eichner and Knapp heard this. That Potter then asked me to put my left arm out and he grabbed my wrist and threw my arm back and then injected me with force on my left arm. That Potter then grabbed me by the shirt and pulled me up to a sitting position. I then stood up and Potter hit me with his right hand on the back of the neck and also pushed me forward at the same time. That Potter then pushed me and said, \"get the fuck out of my office.\" That I was then walking away and Potter came out of the office and threw a diabetic sandwich at my back which hit me from about 10 feet away.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 71.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The Special Investigative Agent, Defendant Fosnot, concluded the following, as stated in his report dated November 21, 2012:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   The investigation revealed a preponderance of the evidence to support the allegation of Physical Abuse of an Inmate against Leonard Potter. Although Potter denied using any force, both inmate Rodriguez and Officer Eichner are very specific in stating Potter jammed or forced the needle into Rodriguez's arm. Additionally, they also both recall Potter slapping inmate Rodriguez on the back of the neck and pushing him out of the exam room immediately after he was just treated with insulin. Potter did admit he \"tossed\" a sandwich at inmate Rodriguez after just treating him, which struck Rodriguez in the face. Thus, the charge of Physical Abuse of an Inmate is sustained against Potter. Furthermore, Lieutenant Knapp, Officer Eichner and inmate Rodriguez all confirm they heard Potter tell inmate Rodriguez to \"get the fuck out of his office\" at the conclusion of the incident. Therefore, the charge of Unprofessional Conduct is also sustained against Potter.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 81.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   These conflicting accounts of what transpired create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Plaintiff was subjected to excessive force on August 11, 2012, especially in light of Defendant Potter's denial of the allegations before this court.

Upon review of the amended complaint and Plaintiff's brief in opposition to the motion for summary judgment, it is clear that Plaintiff is not making this claim against these Defendants. Moreover, Plaintiff has presented no evidence to demonstrate personal involvement by these Defendants in the decision to place Plaintiff in the SHU after the August 11, 2012. Plaintiff does claim, however, that Defendant Fosnot, the SIS agent in charge of the investigation into the events of August 11, 2012, was the official who ordered Plaintiff's removal to the SHU. (Doc. 105 \u00b6 11.) In the motion for summary judgment, Defendant Fosnot asserts that Plaintiff was placed in the SHU in administrative segregation \"for his own protection until the incident could be investigated.\" (Doc. 236 at 5.) He also states, \"Defendant Fosnot of the SIS was assigned to the matter and oversaw the investigation. Plaintiff remained in the SHU until his claims went through the administrative process. This process took several months and Plaintiff was removed from the Lewisburg SHU at its conclusion.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In opposition, Plaintiff has presented no evidence that Defendant Fosnot placed him in the SHU in administrative segregation for any purpose other than to investigate the August 11, 2012 incident. In the absence of evidence of personal involvement and retaliatory motive with respect to the decision to transfer Plaintiff to the SHU, summary judgment will be granted in favor of all Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n    <em>\n     Retaliation in SHU\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Plaintiff also asserts that he faced retaliation for seeking legal action related to the August 11, 2012 incident once he was actually in the SHU. Plaintiff makes this claim against Defendants Thomas, McClintock, Crawley, Fosnot, and Potter. All Defendants deny Plaintiff's allegations. As there appears to be no question that Plaintiff was engaged in the constitutionally protected activity of challenging the legality of Defendant Potter's and others' actions on August 11, 2012, the court will address the remaining elements of this retaliation claim in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   <strong>\n    a.\n    <em>\n     Adverse Action\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Plaintiff contends that he suffered adverse action in the form of the verbal harassment and his conditions of confinement which, as he terms it, constituted a \"campaign of harassment.\" As to verbal abuse, Plaintiff claims that various Defendants made statements to him such as, \"It sucks to be you now,\" (Doc. 105 \u00b6 35); \"Potter will see you soon,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36); \"this is your new home for the next 18 months, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b638); \"suck it up, and next time don't come to the SHU,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 48); and, \"If you were at Camp you would not have to put\n   up with being handcuffed and shackled,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 53).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   General verbal harassment and antagonizing have been found not to constitute an actionable adverse action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Marten v.

Plaintiff has presented no evidence beyond bald allegations that Defendants Thomas, McClintock, Crawley, and Fosnot subjected him to these actions, ranging from conditions in his cell to verbal statements made by corrections officers, in retaliation for his seeking legal action related to the August 11, 2012 incident. With that said, the court also finds that Plaintiff has also failed here to establish the causal link between the exercise of his constitutional rights and the adverse action taken against him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   What is more troubling for the court is Plaintiff's contention that he suffered adverse action in the form of the forced interaction with Defendant Potter himself in the SHU mere days after August 11, 2012, as well as for the weeks following the incident. According to Plaintiff, Defendant Potter was either directing, or performing himself, the dispensing of necessary medication such as insulin to Plaintiff in the SHU. While at first Potter hid his presence from Plaintiff behind the cell door when Plaintiff was receiving his medication, once Plaintiff discovered Potter was on the unit, Potter did nothing to hide the fact the he himself was treating Plaintiff. Plaintiff directs the court to no less than fifteen (15) occasions that Defendant Potter came to his SHU cell to administer medication, and with each occasion, Potter referred to Plaintiff as an \"a** hole.\" This interaction caused great distress to Plaintiff, including extreme headaches and a fear of taking the insulin he presumably believed was somehow tainted by Defendant Potter.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant Potter presents no evidence to refute Plaintiff's allegations that he was allowed to administer medication to Plaintiff in the SHU after the incident and that he undertook a \"campaign of harassment\" against Plaintiff in the SHU in retaliation for Plaintiff's efforts to bring legal action against him. Rather, he insists that he had no personal involvement in this claim. As such, the court finds the presence of disputed facts which should be resolved by a jury and not this court on summary judgment. Further, in light of this factual dispute related to adverse action, the court will also send to a jury the question of whether Plaintiff has established a causal connection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   In sum, the court will grant summary judgment in favor of Defendants Thomas, McClintock, Crawley, and Fosnot with respect to this retaliation claim. The court will allow the claim of retaliation to go forward against Defendant Potter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   <strong>\n    G.\n    <em>\n     Due Process\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Plaintiff also raises a vague claim that his due process rights were violated when Defendant Fosnot ordered his placement in the SHU and denied Plaintiff a satisfactory review of his claims of abuse. Defendant Fosnot counters that the only reason Plaintiff was placed in the SHU was placement in administrative segregation is required for a prisoner's safety while his claims of abuse are being investigated.

The Court applied\n   <em>\n    Sandin\n   </em>\n   and concluded that placement without any type of due process hearing for a period of fifteen (15) months was not an atypical and significant hardship. Furthermore, the inmate's \"commitment to and confinement in administrative custody did not deprive him of a liberty interest and that he was not entitled to procedural due process protection.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"854618\" index=\"169\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/112/703/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"854618\" index=\"169\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/112/703/\">\n    at 708\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

This determination is bolstered by Defendant Fosnot's statement regarding Plaintiff's administrative custody:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-124\">\n   [B]efore I conduct any investigation on a complaint alleging physical abuse I must first forward it to OIA for their review who then forwards it to the office of OIG and then forward[s it] to the Civil Rights Division for review and possible investigation.

In my experience this process usually take much longer than 70 days and can take as long as a year.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   (Doc. 237 at 11.)
