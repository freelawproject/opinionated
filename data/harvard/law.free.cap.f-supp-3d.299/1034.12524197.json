No. 142]. For the reasons stated herein, Defendant's Motion is granted, and this case is transferred to the Northern District of California.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In this patent infringement suit, the Regents of the University of Minnesota (\"the University\") allege that Gilead Sciences, Inc. (\"Gilead\") infringes the University's intellectual property rights in a patent for a drug known as sofosbuvir. (Compl. \u00b6 3 [Doc. No. 1].) Sofosbuvir is an antiviral agent used to treat the hepatitis C virus (\"HCV\") infections. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 41.) The University holds all rights to the patent at issue (the '830 Patent). (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33.) The University alleges that Gilead has infringed the '830 Patent by selling over one billion dollars in sofosbuvir-containing medicines, including Gilead's Sovaldi\u00ae, Harvoni\u00ae,\n   and Epclusa\u00ae brand-name medicines, without obtaining the University's authorization or otherwise compensating the University. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 3; 46-55.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Gilead is a Delaware corporation, with its principal place of business in Foster City, California. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2.) Between 2014 and 2016, Gilead employed the following twelve employees in Minnesota in the positions of Regional Sales Director, Therapeutic Specialist, Community Specialist, and Medical Scientist: Chad Blomgren, Mary Ellen Feldstein, Byron Hamilton, Tracey Johnson, Ajit Kulkarni, Joe Llewellyn, Julie Miller, Carson Munroe, Jaymee Murakami, Christi Murphy, Allison Passolt, and Thomas Wolfe.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Def.'s Resp. to Pl.'s Second Set of Interrogs., Interrog. Resp. No. 5, Ex. A to Minarik Decl. [Doc. No. 157]; D. Johnson Decl. \u00b6 5 [Doc. No. 145].)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   A majority of the twelve employees work in sales and marketing positions as Therapeutic Specialists or Community Specialists, or as managers of those positions. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Passolt Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 2-3 [Doc. No. 147]; Miller Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 2-3 [Doc. No. 152]; Vogel Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 4-5 [Doc. No. 1154]; Wolfe Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 2-3 [Doc. No. 155]; T. Johnson Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 2-3 [Doc. No. 156]; Hamilton Decl. \u00b6 4 [Doc. No. 148]; Blomgren Decl. \u00b6 4 [Doc. No. 149].) Therapeutic Specialists visit and educate \"learned intermediaries,\" such as health care providers, hospitals, and pharmacies, about Gilead's products, and Community Specialists also visit learned intermediaries, as well as community groups. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D. Johnson Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 4; 6;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   D. Johnson Dep. at 14-15, Ex. E to Hrycyszyn Decl.) Therapeutic Specialists and Community Specialists also occasionally plan local exhibits or conferences. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D. Johnson Decl. \u00b6 6 [Doc. No. 145]; D. Johnson Dep. at 9, Ex. E to Hrycyszyn Decl.) David Johnson, Gilead's Vice President of Sales and Marketing, Liver Disease Unit, asserts that while these are sales positions, \"sales\" in the pharmaceutical industry do not involve direct sales from the salesperson to the customer. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D. Johnson Dep. at 13-15, Ex. E to Hrycyszyn Decl.) Rather, pharmaceutical salespersons attempt to sway medical providers to prescribe particular medications to their patients. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ) Consistent with Johnson's testimony, Gilead's Minnesota Therapeutic Specialists, Community Specialists, and their managers contend that they do not take orders from customers or solicit sales directly from distributors, wholesalers, pharmacies, or pharmacy benefit managers. (Passolt Decl. \u00b6 10; Hamilton Decl. \u00b6 10; Blomgren Decl. \u00b6 11; Murphy Decl. \u00b6 10 [Doc. No. 150]; Miller Decl. \u00b6 11; Feldstein Decl. \u00b6 10; Vogel Decl. \u00b6 9; Wolfe Decl. \u00b6 10; T. Johnson Decl. \u00b6 11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Gilead's Medical Scientists in Minnesota respond to questions from healthcare providers about Gilead's products, and coordinate experiments and clinical projects regarding Gilead's various drug therapies. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D. Johnson Decl. \u00b6 4; Kulkarni Decl. \u00b6 4 [Doc. No. 146]; Llewellyn Decl. \u00b6 5 [Doc. No. 151].) Like the Therapeutic Specialists and Community Specialists, Medical Scientists do not take customers' orders or make direct sales. (Kulkarni Decl. \u00b6 10; Llewellyn Decl. \u00b6 11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Through its headquarters in Foster City, California, Gilead sells its healthcare products to wholesalers or pharmacies. (D. Johnson Decl. \u00b6 7.) Gilead's Minnesota sales force likewise understands that all orders are placed with corporate headquarters in California. (Kulkarni Decl. \u00b6 10; Passolt Decl. \u00b6 10; Hamilton Decl.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 10; Murphy Decl. \u00b6 10; Llewellyn Decl. \u00b6 11; Miller Decl. \u00b6 11; Wolfe Decl. \u00b6 10; T. Johnson Decl. \u00b6 11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Three Minnesota employees perform a greater portion of their work outside of Minnesota, (Kulkarni Decl. \u00b6 5; Hamilton Decl. \u00b6 5; Miller Decl. \u00b6 5), as was also true of another employee, during the time that he lived in Minnesota. (Blomgren Decl. \u00b6 6.) Yet another employee splits her time equally between Minnesota and a neighboring state, (T. Johnson Decl. \u00b6 5), while six others perform the majority of their work in Minnesota. (Passolt Decl. \u00b6 5; Murphy Decl. \u00b6 5; Llewellyn Decl. \u00b6 6; Feldstein Decl. \u00b6 5; Wolfe Decl. \u00b6 5; T. Johnson Decl. \u00b6 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   None of the employees work from a physical Gilead office in Minnesota. (Kulkarni Decl. \u00b6 5; Passolt Decl. \u00b6 5; Hamilton Decl. \u00b6 5; Blomgren Decl. \u00b6 6; Murphy Decl. \u00b6 5; Llewellyn Decl. \u00b6 6; Miller Decl. \u00b6 5; Feldstein Decl. \u00b6 5; Vogel Decl. \u00b6 7; Wolfe Decl. \u00b6 5; T. Johnson Decl.) Instead, they perform the majority of their work \"in the field,\" i.e., in health care providers' offices, clinics, hospitals, and pharmacies. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   When they are not working in the field, the employees work from their respective home offices, as opposed to a separate, physical Gilead office in Minnesota.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Kulkarni Decl. \u00b6 7; Passolt Decl. \u00b6 7; Hamilton Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 5; 7; Blomgren Decl. \u00b6 7; Murphy Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 5; 7; Llewellyn Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 6; 8; Miller Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 5; 7; Feldstein Decl. \u00b6 7; Wolfe Decl. \u00b6 7; T. Johnson Decl. \u00b6 7.) Two employees have taken a tax deduction for their home office at some point, (Kulkarni Decl. \u00b6 7; Miller Decl. \u00b6 7), although the majority have not. (Passolt Decl. \u00b6 7; Hamilton Decl. \u00b6 7; Blomgren Decl. \u00b6 7; Murphy Decl. \u00b6 7\n   <strong>\n    ;\n   </strong>\n   Feldstein Decl. \u00b6\n   <strong>\n    7;\n   </strong>\n   Wolfe Decl. \u00b6\n   <strong>\n    7\n   </strong>\n   ; T. Johnson Decl. \u00b6 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Gilead's Minnesota employees do not use an administrative or secretarial service in this state or elsewhere. (Kulkarni Decl. \u00b6 7; Passolt Decl. \u00b6 7; Hamilton Decl. \u00b6 7; Blomgren Decl. \u00b6 7; Murphy Decl. \u00b6 7; Llewellyn Decl. \u00b6 8; Miller Decl. \u00b6 7; Feldstein Decl. \u00b6 7; Wolfe Decl. \u00b6 7; T. Johnson Decl. \u00b6 7.) Their respective home offices contain a computer, printer, and iPad provided by Gilead (Kulkarni Decl. \u00b6 7; Passolt Decl. \u00b6 7; Hamilton Decl. \u00b6 7; Blomgren Decl. \u00b6 7; Murphy Decl. \u00b6 7; Llewellyn Decl. \u00b6 8; Miller Decl. \u00b6 7; Feldstein Decl. \u00b6 7; Vogel Decl. \u00b6 8; Wolfe Decl. \u00b6 7; T. Johnson Decl. \u00b6 7), and in one instance, a projector. (Murphy Decl. \u00b6 7.) Gilead pays for its employees' home phone, internet, a portion of their monthly cell phone bills, and the lease on their vehicles. (Kulkarni Decl. \u00b6 9; Passolt Decl. \u00b6 9; Hamilton Decl. \u00b6 9; Blomgren Decl. \u00b6 10; Murphy Decl. \u00b6 7; Llewellyn Decl. \u00b6 10; Miller Decl. \u00b6 9; Feldstein Decl. \u00b6 9; Vogel Decl. \u00b6 8; Wolfe Decl. \u00b6 9; T. Johnson Decl. \u00b6 9.) Gilead listed the yearly total amount of these auto lease payments as \"capitalized rents\" and \"total property\" in its 2014 and 2015 corporation franchise tax returns prepared for the Minnesota Department of Revenue. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Exs. C [at GSI-SOF00038264] &amp; D [at GSI-SOF00038266] to Hrycyszyn Decl.; D. Johnson Dep. at 37, Ex. E to Hrycyszyn Decl.) Also on these forms, Gilead entered no amount for \"average tangible property and land owned/used,\" leaving the line blank. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ex. C [at GSI-SOF00038264] &amp; D [at GSI-SOF00038266] to Hrycyszyn Decl.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Gilead's Minnesota employees do not stock any Gilead products for sale in their homes or elsewhere in Minnesota. (D. Johnson Decl. \u00b6 10.) A few employees keep\n   a limited supply of Gilead promotional material in their homes. (Passolt Decl. \u00b6 7; Hamilton Decl. \u00b6 7; Blomgren Decl. \u00b6 7; Miller Decl. \u00b6 7; Wolfe Decl. \u00b6 7; T. Johnson Decl. \u00b6 7.) Two Minnesota Gilead employees keep samples of two different Gilead products (non-HCV) in Minnesota, (D. Johnson Decl. \u00b6 10; Miller Decl. \u00b6 10; T. Johnson Decl. \u00b6 10), in an offsite storage locker leased by Gilead through a third party. (Def.'s Resp. to Pl.'s Second Set of Interrogs., Interrog. Resp. No. 4, Ex. A to Minarik Decl.) A third Gilead employee, who lives in Wisconsin, keeps a quantity of another Gilead product (non-HCV) in a storage locker located in Minnesota. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Gilead does not lease or own any other property in Minnesota such as \"offices, warehouses, manufacturing plants, research and development centers, laboratories, or any facilities where commercial stocks of Gilead commercial products are consistently maintained.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   D. Johnson Decl. \u00b6 10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   While Gilead's Minnesota sales force receives business mail at their individual home addresses, (Kulkarni Decl. \u00b6 7; Passolt Decl. \u00b6 7; Hamilton Decl. \u00b6 7; Blomgren Decl. \u00b6 7; Murphy Decl. \u00b6 7; Llewellyn Decl. \u00b6 8; Miller Decl. \u00b6 7; Feldstein Decl. \u00b6 7; Wolfe Decl. \u00b6 7; T. Johnson Decl. \u00b6 7), their business cards list Gilead's corporate address in California, not their home addresses.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The phone numbers on the business cards for three employees list a California number that forwards to the employees' automated voice messaging mailboxes. (Passolt Decl. \u00b6 6; Feldstein Decl. \u00b6 6; Wolfe Decl. \u00b6 6). Most of the Minnesota employees list their personal cell phone numbers, with Minnesota area codes, on their business cards. (Blomgren Decl. \u00b6 7; Passolt Decl. \u00b6 6; Hamilton Decl. \u00b6 6; Blomgren Decl. \u00b6 7; Murphy Decl. \u00b6 6; Miller Decl. \u00b6 6; Feldstein Decl. \u00b6 6; Wolfe Decl. \u00b6 6; T. Johnson Decl. \u00b6 6.) To the best of their knowledge, none of the employees' home addresses or personal phone numbers are listed in any Minnesota directory as an address or phone number for Gilead. (Kulkarni Decl. \u00b6 8; Passolt Decl. \u00b6 8; Hamilton Decl. \u00b6 8; Blomgren Decl. \u00b6 9; Murphy Decl. \u00b6 8; Llewellyn Decl. \u00b6 9; Miller Decl. \u00b6 8; Feldstein Decl. \u00b6 8; Wolfe Decl. \u00b6 8; T.

Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In the Complaint, filed in August 2016, the University asserts that this Court has personal jurisdiction over Gilead and that venue is proper \"under at least\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201391\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1391\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 1400.\" (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 6-7.) However, on May 22, 2017, while the parties were engaged in discovery, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a decision in\n   <em>\n    TC Heartland LLC v. Kraft Foods Grp. Brands LLC\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604310\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1514/\">\n    137 S.Ct. 1514\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604310\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1514/\">\n    197 L.Ed.2d 816\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017), that significantly affected venue in patent cases. In light of\n   <em>\n    TC Heartland\n   </em>\n   , Gilead sought expedited briefing on its motion to dismiss for improper venue, and requested a short stay of all other proceedings. (Def.'s June 8, 2017 Letter at 2-3 [Doc. No. 128].) The Court granted Gilead's request, scheduled the hearing on its motion to dismiss, and stayed all other pending deadlines and non-venue-related discovery. (June 12, 2017 Order at 2 [Doc. No. 140].)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   More recently, on September 21, 2017, and in light of\n   <em>\n    TC Heartland\n   </em>\n   , the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals issued a decision concerning venue in patent infringement cases,\n   <em>\n    In re: Cray, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266925\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/871/1355/\">\n    871 F.3d 1355\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Fed.

(September 26, 2017 Order at 1 [Doc. No. 223].)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In its supplemental briefing, Gilead argues that under\n   <em>\n    TC Heartland\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Cray\n   </em>\n   , the University cannot meet its burden to establish venue in this District because Gilead is not incorporated in Minnesota and lacks a regular, established physical location from which it conducts business in the state. (Def.'s Supp'l Mem. at 2-11 [Doc. No. 230].) While the University acknowledges that Gilead is not incorporated in Minnesota, it contends that venue is proper in this District because Gilead has a regular and established place of business here. (Pl.'s Supp'l Opp'n Mem. at 2-3 [Doc. No. 229].)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

The same is true here. As a fundamental matter, there appears to be no dispute that Gilead lacks a physical office in Minnesota, and does not own its employees' homes in Minnesota, nor did it participate in their selection. Instead, the evidence demonstrates that Gilead does not own a physical \"place\" of any kind in this District. In its Minnesota franchise tax returns for 2014 and 2015, Gilead left blank, and did not enter any dollar amount, for the line requesting \"average tangible property and land owned/used.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ex. C [at GSI-SOF00038264] &amp; D [at GSI-SOF00038266] to Hrycyszyn Decl.) On the same forms, Gilead listed the total amount of automobile leases it assumed on behalf of its Minnesota employees. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266925\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/871/1355/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) But lease payments for transient vehicles do not sufficiently evidence Gilead's regular and established physical place of business in Minnesota.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   As noted, two Minnesota employees, (D. Johnson Decl. \u00b6 10; Miller Decl. \u00b6 10; T. Johnson Decl. \u00b6 10), and a third employee, who resides in Wisconsin, maintain limited quantities of sample Gilead medications in storage lockers located in Minnesota. (Def.'s Resp. to Pl.'s Second Set of Interrogs., Interrog. Resp. No. 4, Ex. A to Minarik Decl.) Gilead leases these offsite storage lockers through a third party. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Court is not persuaded that these relatively small storage lockers, containing a limited quantity of pharmaceutical products, constitute a sufficiently regular and established physical foothold of Gilead in Minnesota.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Nor is the Court persuaded by the fact that Gilead provides computers, printers, and iPads to its Minnesota employees and pays their phone, internet, and cell phone bills. (Kulkarni Decl. \u00b6 7; Passolt Decl. \u00b6 7; Hamilton Decl. \u00b6 7; Blomgren Decl. \u00b6 7; Murphy Decl. \u00b6 7; Llewellyn Decl. \u00b6 8; Miller Decl. \u00b6 7; Feldstein Decl. \u00b6 7; Vogel\n   Decl. \u00b6 8; Wolfe Decl. \u00b6 7; T.

Gilead's provision of these non-fixed, temporary items is insufficient to establish or ratify Gilead's place of business in Minnesota.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The University also cites Gilead's \"control\" over dozens of clinical trials in Minnesota as evidence that Gilead exercises ownership or control over a place in Minnesota. (Pl.'s Supp'l Mem. at 9-10.) While Gilead may indeed closely control the protocol of these studies, and the presence of its drugs, there is no evidence that Gilead owns or controls the physical space in which the trials are held.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Condition of Employment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The University also argues that the presence of Gilead's employees in Minnesota is \"material\" to the company's business, and that Gilead depends on this physical presence. (Pl.'s Supp'l Opp'n Mem. at 6.) But Gilead did not condition its offers of employment on residence in Minnesota, let alone the maintenance of a home office in the state. (D. Johnson Dep. at 129, Ex. A to Mortara Decl.) (\"These positions cover multiple states. So it is not required that the person live in Minnesota and still be able to adequately cover these customers.\") Moreover, as a practical matter, Gilead does not require Minnesota-based employees to live in the state for purposes of serving its Minnesota customers. As Vice President of Sales and Marketing Johnson testified, \"Regardless of where [Gilead's employees] live, they're able to interact with Minnesota-based physicians.\n   <em>\n    It doesn't matter where they live\n   </em>\n   ....

Storage and/or Distribution of Employer's Products\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   As previously discussed, none of Gilead's Minnesota employees store or distribute Gilead products in or from their homes. (D. Johnson Decl. \u00b6 10.) While a few employees maintain small quantities of promotional literature in their home offices, (Passolt Decl. \u00b6 7; Hamilton Decl. \u00b6 7; Blomgren Decl. \u00b6 7; Miller Decl. \u00b6 7; Wolfe Decl. \u00b6 7; T. Johnson Decl. \u00b6 7), Gilead does not require them to do so. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D. Johnson Dep. at 79-80, Ex. A to Mortara Decl.) More typically, Gilead's employees store such materials in the trunk of their cars. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In addition, Gilead's Minnesota employees do not sell products directly to Gilead's customers. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Passolt Decl. \u00b6 10; Hamilton Decl. \u00b6 10; Blomgren Decl. \u00b6 11; Murphy Decl. \u00b6 10; Miller Decl. \u00b6 11; Feldstein Decl. \u00b6 10; Vogel Decl. \u00b6 9; Wolfe Decl. \u00b6 10; T. Johnson Decl. \u00b6 11; Kulkarni Decl. \u00b6 10; Llewellyn Decl. \u00b6 11.) Although a home office can be considered a company's place of business under some circumstances,\n   <em>\n    Cray\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266925\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/871/1355/\">\n    871 F.3d at 1365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the facts here do not sufficiently support an inference that the employees' homes are\n   <em>\n    Gilead\n   </em>\n   's places of business.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    d. Employer's Outward Representations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   As noted, a defendant's representations, such as whether it lists the alleged place of business on a website, telephone or other directory, or affixes its name on a sign associated with the physical place in the district, are also relevant to the determination of whether the place is \"of the defendant.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266925\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/871/1355/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 1362-63 (citing\n   <em>\n    Cordis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"361034\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/769/733/#p737\">\n    769 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   735 ;\n   <em>\n    Grantham\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2159405\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/420/1182/#p1185\">\n    420 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1185-86 ). \"But the mere fact that a defendant has advertised that it has a place of business or has even set up an office is not sufficient; the defendant must\n   actually engage in business from that location.

The home addresses and personal phone numbers of Gilead's employees are not listed in any Minnesota directory or listing for Gilead. (Kulkarni Decl. \u00b6 8; Passolt Decl. \u00b6 8; Hamilton Decl. \u00b6 8; Blomgren Decl. \u00b6 9; Murphy Decl. \u00b6 8; Llewellyn Decl. \u00b6 9; Miller Decl. \u00b6 8; Feldstein Decl. \u00b6 8; Wolfe Decl. \u00b6 8; T. Johnson Decl. \u00b6 8.) Likewise, the address displayed on almost all of the employees' business cards is the California address of Gilead's headquarters. (Kulkarni Decl. \u00b6 6; Passolt Decl. \u00b6 6; Hamilton Decl. \u00b6 6; Murphy Decl. \u00b6 6; Miller Decl. \u00b6 6; Feldstein Decl. \u00b6 6; Wolfe Decl. \u00b6 6; T. Johnson Decl. \u00b6 6.) Only one employee, now residing in California, states, \"to the best of his recollection,\" that when he worked in Minnesota, his business cards listed his home address, although they might have listed Gilead's corporate address \"at times.\" (Blomgren Decl. \u00b6 7.) The possible listing of this employee's former Minnesota home address, at some point in time, as a Gilead business is simply too tenuous a connection on which to find that Gilead has a regular and established place of business in Minnesota. And as to phone numbers, while most of the Minnesota employees list their Minnesota phone numbers on their business cards, (Passolt Decl. \u00b6 6; Hamilton Decl. \u00b6 6; Blomgren Decl. \u00b6 7; Murphy Decl. \u00b6 6; Miller Decl. \u00b6 6; Feldstein Decl. \u00b6 6; Wolfe Decl. \u00b6 6; T. Johnson Decl. \u00b6 6), the employees in\n   <em>\n    Cray\n   </em>\n   listed their home phone numbers as well,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266925\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/871/1355/\">\n    871 F.3d at 1364\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , yet the court found venue improper. Granted, two Gilead employees took tax deductions for their home offices, (Kulkarni Decl. \u00b6 7; Miller Decl. \u00b6 7), but again, nothing outwardly conveys that any of the Gilead employees' homes are Gilead's places of business. Such scant evidence of a physical place,\n   <em>\n    of the Defendant\n   </em>\n   , in this District is insufficient to establish venue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    III. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   In conclusion, although the Court respects the University's choice of venue, the Federal Circuit's recent decision in\n   <em>\n    Cray\n   </em>\n   , which this Court must follow, dictates the result here. Gilead does not \"reside\" in this District under the first prong of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201400\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1400\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). Nor does it have a regular and established physical place of business in this District sufficient to establish venue under the second prong of \u00a7 1400(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Because Gilead's physical headquarters are located in California, where it has a regular and established place of business, this case could have been brought in that district. Pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201406\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1406\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), the Court finds that the interests of justice favor transfer, rather than dismissal. Accordingly, the Court transfers this case to the United States District Court for the Northern District of California.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   1.
