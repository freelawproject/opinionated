TUNHEIM, Chief Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiff Lawrence Miller brought breach of contract and promissory estoppel claims in state court against his former employer Starkey Laboratories, Inc. (\"Starkey\"), to enforce certain terms of his employment contract. Starkey removed the case to federal court, arguing that the provisions at issue-together with related provisions in the contracts of other top company managers-are an Employee Retirement Income Security Act (\"ERISA\") pension benefit plan. Starkey now moves to dismiss the case on the ground that Miller's state-law claims are completely preempted by ERISA. Miller moves to remand and seeks sanctions against Starkey. Because Starkey has not shown by a preponderance of the evidence that the contracts establish an ERISA pension plan or program, the Court must grant Miller's Motion to Remand and deny Starkey's Motion to Dismiss as moot. However, because\n   Starkey's legal position is not unreasonable, the Court will deny Miller's Motion for Sanctions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Lawrence Miller worked for Starkey Laboratories from 1987 until he was terminated on September 8, 2015. (Notice of Removal \u00b6 1, Ex. B (\"Compl.\") \u00b6 3, Aug. 28, 2017, Docket No. 1.) Miller was Starkey's Senior Vice President of Human Resources. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3.) On the same day Starkey that fired Miller, it also fired its President, Chief Financial Officer, Vice President of Operations, and Miller's wife Julie, an administrative assistant. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7.) Miller and three co-defendants are presently standing trial for allegedly fraudulent conduct involving Starkey. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   3d Superseding Indictment,\n   <em>\n    United States v. Ruzicka\n   </em>\n   , Jan. 8, 2018, Criminal No. 16-246, Docket No. 298.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Miller, a Minnesota resident, brought this case against Starkey, a Minnesota corporation, in state court. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 1-2.) Miller stated two state-law causes of action, both founded on Starkey's refusal to pay certain post-separation benefits: Breach of Contract and Promissory Estoppel. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 9-17.) These claims are based on Miller's employment contract (the \"Agreement\"), dated July 1, 2006. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4; Decl. of David Bradley Olsen Supp. Mot. to Dismiss (\"1\n   <sup>\n    st\n   </sup>\n   Olsen Decl.\") \u00b6 3, Ex. B (\"Agreement\"), Aug. 28, 2017, Docket No. 6.) The Agreement provided that Miller could only be terminated for an \"important reason\" (the \"termination provision\"), and promised a \"long-term services and loyalty bonus\" (the \"loyalty benefit\") to be paid after Miller's separation, regardless of cause (the \"loyalty provision\"). (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 5-6; Agreement \u00a7\u00a7 III(1)-(2), IX.) The loyalty benefit was to be a percentage of Miller's base salary for every year of service, to be paid in six annual installments. (Compl. \u00b6 6; Agreement \u00a7 IX.) Miller alleges that both the termination and loyalty provisions were breached. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 7-8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Starkey removed the case to federal court claiming federal question jurisdiction, arguing that the loyalty provision established or is part of an ERISA pension plan, therefore giving rise to complete preemption of the state-law claims. (Notice of Removal \u00b6\u00b6 5-6.) Starkey has submitted contracts of other top executives that contain related provisions. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   1\n   <sup>\n    st\n   </sup>\n   Olsen Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 4-5, Exs. C-D; Decl. of David Bradley Olsen Opp. Remand Mot. (\"2d Olsen Decl.\") \u00b6\u00b6 4-9, Exs. F-K, Oct. 19, 2017, Docket No. 27.) Starkey filed a Motion to Dismiss for failure to state a claim, arguing that complete preemption, express preemption, and Miller's failure to exhaust his administrative remedies justify dismissal. (Mot. to Dismiss (\"MTD\"), Aug. 28, 2017, Docket No. 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Miller timely filed a Motion to Remand, arguing that the loyalty provision is not part of an ERISA plan, but is merely a freestanding single-employee contract term. (Mot. to Remand (\"Remand Mot.\"), Sept. 7, 2017, Docket No. 18; Mem. Supp. Remand Mot. at 1, Sept. 28, 2017, Docket No. 20.) Miller also alleges that he sought to arrange a meet-and-confer with Starkey, but its counsel did not respond. (Decl. of David H. Redden \u00b6 2 &amp; Ex. 1, Sept. 28, 2017, Docket No. 21.) Subsequently, Miller filed a Motion for Sanctions, arguing that Starkey's filings are legally frivolous and designed to delay this case until after Miller's trial. (Mot. for Sanctions (\"Sanctions Mot.\"), Oct. 26, 2017, Docket No. 29; Mem. Supp. Sanctions Mot., Oct. 26, 2017, Docket No. 31.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   All three motions are now before the Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    I. MOTION TO REMAND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Miller moves to remand on the ground that the loyalty provision was not part of\n   an ERISA plan. Because the Motion to Remand raises a jurisdictional question, the Court must deal with it first. If the loyalty provision was part of an ERISA plan, the Court has jurisdiction to consider Starkey's Motion to Dismiss; otherwise, remand is required.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

The Loyalty Provision\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   ERISA defines two types of plans: \"employee welfare benefit plans,\" also known as \"welfare plans,\" and \"employee pension benefit plans,\" also\n   known as \"pension plans.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201002\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1) - (2)(A). Starkey alleges that the loyalty benefit falls into the latter category, which ERISA defines as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   any\n   <strong>\n    plan, fund, or program\n   </strong>\n   which was heretofore or is hereafter established or maintained by an employer or by an employee organization, or by both, to the extent that by its express terms or\n   <strong>\n    as a result of surrounding circumstances\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   such plan, fund, or program-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   (i) provides retirement income to employees, or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   (ii) results in a\n   <strong>\n    deferral of income\n   </strong>\n   by employees for periods extending to the termination of covered employment or beyond,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   regardless of the method of calculating the contributions made to the plan, the method of calculating the benefits under the plan or the method of distributing benefits from the plan.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201002\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1002(2)(A) (emphases added). Specifically, Starkey argues that the loyalty provision established or is part of a so-called \"Top Hat\" plan; that is, \"a plan which is [1] unfunded and is maintained by an employer primarily for the purpose of [2] providing deferred compensation [3] for a select group of management or highly compensated employees.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201051\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1051\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2), 1081(a)(3), 1101(a)(1). Top Hat plans are exempted from certain ERISA requirements, but not its enforcement provisions.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n    <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201051\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n    with\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1132. As such, claims to enforce a Top Hat plan may justify complete preemption. Miller does not dispute that the loyalty benefit fulfills these elements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   For the loyalty provision to create or be part of a Top Hat plan, however, the loyalty benefit must also fulfill the requirements of all ERISA plans.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dak., Minn. &amp; E.

Miller argues that it does not meet two requirements expounded by the Eighth Circuit. First, he argues that the Agreement cannot create an ERISA benefit plan because it is an individual contract with a single employee. Second, he argues that the loyalty provision cannot be part of an ERISA benefit plan because the benefit does not require an ongoing administrative scheme. Although Miller's first argument is unavailing in light of virtually identical provisions in two other senior executive contracts, Starkey has not met its burden to show by a preponderance of the evidence that the benefits require an ongoing administrative scheme. As such, it has failed to demonstrate that the \"essence\" of Miller's claims could have been brought under ERISA.

Four of the six, including Miller's, specify that the benefit is to be paid in annual installments. And three of the six, including Miller's, provide the same payment schedule. At a minimum, Miller cannot contest that his contract is unrelated to the other two with virtually-identical loyalty provisions. Because Miller does not contest that the loyalty provision meets the basic elements of a Top Hat plan, the Court finds that Starkey has shown by a preponderance of the evidence that the circumstances surrounding the three contracts are such that they collectively established a deferred-compensation program under Section 1002(2)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

Mo. 1996) (collecting cases) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Turning to the facts of this case, the first three\n   <em>\n    Crews\n   </em>\n   factors suggest that the loyalty benefit requires ongoing administration. The benefit is to be paid in six installments over the five years after separation. Thus, as in\n   <em>\n    Petersen\n   </em>\n   , the benefit is a continual payment imposing a long-term obligation on the employer, and, as in\n   <em>\n    Emmenegger\n   </em>\n   , a payout is triggered each time a covered employee separates. But those two cases dealt with large, long-running plans; here, by contrast, the provision covered a small number of employees for a short time. And the fourth factor-frequently determinative-strongly suggests that no ongoing administration is required. Although Starkey must undertake a case-by-case review of salary data to determine when benefits should be paid and for how much, those mechanical calculations do not require discretion. Indeed, the loyalty provision expressly forecloses Starkey from exercising discretion as to eligibility: \"For purposes of this section, 'termination' shall mean any and all events causing separation of employment including voluntary and involuntary termination, death or long term disability.\" (1\n   <sup>\n    st\n   </sup>\n   Olsen Decl. \u00b6 3, Ex. B, \u00a7 IX.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   As such, this case is an inverted\n   <em>\n    Emmenegger\n   </em>\n   : there, the employer's complete discretion outweighed the fact that the benefit was a lump-sum payment; here, Starkey's complete lack of discretion outweighs the fact that the benefit is to be paid over a period of years. Thus, the Court finds that Starkey has not shown by a preponderance of the evidence that the loyalty provision requires a \"separate, ongoing administrative scheme.\"\n   <em>\n    Kulinski\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11309658\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/21/254/#p257\">\n    21 F.3d at 257\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In light of these doubts, the Court must grant Miller's Motion to Remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Costs and Fees\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Miller moves for an award of costs and fees associated with removal under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201447\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c). As discussed above, Starkey justified removal on the ground that Miller's state-law claims are preempted by ERISA because the loyalty provision established or is part of an ERISA pension plan. Because the holding of\n   <em>\n    Schieffer\n   </em>\n   is limited to single-contract welfare benefit plans, and because it is not unreasonable to argue that the loyalty benefit requires an ongoing administrative scheme, the Court finds that Starkey had a good-faith basis to justify removal. As such, the Court will decline to award costs and fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    II. MOTION FOR SANCTIONS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Miller also moves for sanctions against Starkey on the ground that its removal and Motion to Dismiss violated Rule 11(b)(2) because no reasonable and competent attorney could conclude that the loyalty provision is part of an ERISA plan and violated Rule 11(b)(1) because the motions were filed for the improper purpose\n   of creating unnecessary delay. \"The imposition of sanctions is a serious matter and should be approached with circumspection.\"\n   <em>\n    O'Connell v.
