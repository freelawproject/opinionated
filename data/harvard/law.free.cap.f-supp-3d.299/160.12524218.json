Interrelation of Operations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   When considering the first factor of the four part test, interrelation of operations, the NLRB looks to see whether the following seven functions are combined as indicia of interrelatedness: (1) accounting records; (2) bank accounts; (3) lines of credit; (4) payroll preparation; (5) switchboards; (6) telephone numbers; or (7) offices.\n   <em>\n    Tewelde\n   </em>\n   , 89 F.Supp.2d at 17 ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    W.

Plaintiff has not provided the Court with much evidence of commonality between the Embassy and Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Plaintiff argues instead that the two entities are interrelated because the \"work of the locally engaged staff 'employed' by [d]efendant and the diplomatic personnel 'employed' by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs have interrelated operations.\" Pl.'s Opp. at 6. She also asserts in her opposition that they all \"work out of the same location.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=224%20N.L.R.B.%20274\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   While plaintiff does not point to anything in the record that would verify this contention, it is undisputed that the diplomatic personnel and locally engaged staff were \"posted\" to the same Embassy located in Washington, D.C. Def.'s SOF \u00b6\u00b6 6, 11; Pl.'s SOF \u00b6\u00b6 6, 11. But plaintiff's other argument is conclusory and not supported by any evidence in the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The Court notes that Mbewe testified that \"the embassy is ... a unit under the ministry of foreign affairs,\" Ex. 11 to Def.'s Mot. [Dkt. # 80-5] at 25:20-27:7,\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   and it is undisputed that the Ministry had a role in setting the salaries and conditions of employment of the locally engaged staff as well as the diplomatic personnel.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s SOF \u00b6\u00b6 9, 13; Pl.'s SOF \u00b6\u00b6 9, 13. Thus, to the extent plaintiff has presented evidence of interrelated operations, it is very weak.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Common Management\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   There is no evidence of common management between the Embassy and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. While the Ministry is part of Zambia's government,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Mbewe Dep. at 25:20-26:1 plaintiff does not provide the Court with any information about who runs the Ministry, let alone whether any of those individuals have their hands in the Embassy's affairs. Nor does she proffer any evidence concerning the management structure at the Embassy. Although the parties do not dispute that both the Ambassador and the diplomatic heads of departments had some control over the Embassy's locally engaged staff, Def.'s SOF \u00b6\u00b6 7-8; Pl.'s SOF\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   \u00b6\u00b6 7-8, the Court has been told nothing about how the Embassy itself was managed on a daily basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Thus, plaintiff has not pointed to evidence in the record that would rebut defendant's contention that the Ministry was not involved in the management of Embassy affairs and that \"locally engaged staff were to be managed exclusively by each mission.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mem. at 17; Def.'s Reply at 5.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Common Ownership and Financial Control\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   There is very little evidence in the record with regard to the common ownership or financial control of the Embassy by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. While the Embassy is a unit under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, it is unclear whether the relationship is a financial one or how the Embassy is funded. Plaintiff has not pointed the Court to any evidence to demonstrate that the entities are financially interrelated other than the undisputed fact that the salaries of the locally engaged staff had to be approved by the Minister of Foreign Affairs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s SOF \u00b6 9; Pl.'s SOF \u00b6 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Centralized Control of Labor Relations and Personnel\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   This brings the Court to the most critical factor-the centralized control of labor relations and personnel-which is accorded the greatest weight.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sears v.

Moreover, the diplomatic personnel posted to the Embassy on behalf of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had the authority to hire, fire, and discipline locally engaged staff, and the diplomatic heads of departments gave the staff members work assignments and exercised daily supervision over their work. Def.'s SOF \u00b6\u00b6 7-8; Pl.'s SOF \u00b6\u00b6 7-8;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tewelde\n   </em>\n   , 89 F.Supp.2d at 18 (finding that there was no evidence of centralized control of labor relations where the State Department did not hire, fire, set wages, working hours, working conditions, or benefits). And plaintiff could not receive her paycheck until it was signed by Mbewe.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Barot Dep. at 20:17-21:7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Defendant argues that the Ministry had no role in Embassy personnel matters, and it points to a letter sent from a Director at the Ministry to the Ambassador to the U.S., stating that personnel matters should be addressed at the individual mission level. Ex. 12 to Def.'s Mot. [Dkt. # 80-5] (\"Finally, support staff in Missions abroad should not be encouraged to write to this Ministry over personnel matters which can and should be addressed by respective Missions who are their employers.\");\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mem. at 17; Def.'s Reply at 5. However, defendant fails to mention that in the remainder of the letter, the Director goes on to advise the Ambassador on how to deal with the employee inquiry being discussed. Ex. 12 to Def.'s Mot. [Dkt. # 80-5]. The Director also encourages the Embassy\n   to \"ensure that the general conditions of employment for all the Local Staff are standardized.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   So the letter supports more than one inference.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   More important, while these factual circumstances relate to control over employees in general, the \"focal point of the Court's inquiry ... is the degree of control an entity has over the adverse employment decision on which the Title VII suit is based.\"\n   <em>\n    Tewelde\n   </em>\n   , 89 F.Supp.2d at 19 (internal quotation marks omitted). Defendant maintains that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs \"was in no way involved in the adverse employment decisions\" in this case. Def.'s Reply at 5. But it is undisputed that Mbewe, Mbula, Minister Chioza, and the Ambassador-all of whom were characterized by defendant as employees of the Ministry, and not the Embassy-\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mem. at 17-18, were involved in plaintiff's placement on administrative leave and her ultimate termination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s SOF \u00b6\u00b6 35-37; Pl.'s SOF \u00b6\u00b6 35-37.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   So, although there is no evidence that anyone located in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Zambia had any role in the adverse employment actions at issue in this case, the diplomatic personnel who worked on behalf of the Ministry in Washington, D.C. were directly involved in the actions being challenged in this case. Indeed, defendant acknowledges in its supplemental brief that the diplomats \"manage the locally engaged staff in Washington, D.C.,\" and that \"for that limited task, they wear a different 'hat' and act in their capacity as\n   <em>\n    employer and manager\n   </em>\n   of the clerical and administrative personnel.\" Suppl. Mem. in Resp. to Ct.'s Order [Dkt. # 91] (\"Def.'s Suppl. Mem.\") at 5. This is enough to create a genuine issue of material fact on the question of whether the Ministry exercises controls over Embassy personnel matters.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   The Court recognizes that the \"single employer\" four-factor test may not perfectly capture the integration of two governmental entities. But, since the last factor addressed by the Court is generally considered the most important, the Court finds that there is enough evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is an integrated enterprise or a \"single employer\" for purposes of Title VII and the ADEA. If that factual question were resolved in plaintiff's favor, at least nine diplomats\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   posted to the Embassy would be included in the total number of Embassy employees for purposes of meeting the statutory requirement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, the\n   Court will not grant summary judgment to defendant on this basis, and it must address the merits of plaintiff's claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   <strong>\n    II. The Court will grant defendant's motion on plaintiffs ADEA claim.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that the Embassy discriminated against her on the basis of her age in violation of the ADEA. The ADEA protects \"individuals who are at least 40 years of age.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20631\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 631\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).

She advances two main arguments: (1) that defendant's shifting reasons for its decision to terminate her is evidence of discrimination, and (2) that defendant's belief that she deleted the computer files was not honestly and reasonably held.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Opp. at 10-13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Shifting Explanations for Plaintiff's Termination\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Plaintiff argues that the pretextual nature of defendant's explanation can be inferred from the fact that defendant offered \"shifting\" explanations for her termination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Opp. at 10-11. She points to the September 10 letter placing her on administrative leave, which states that defendant was doing so \"after serious consideration of the circumstances\n   surrounding [her] actions\" after the meeting \"regarding matters pertaining to [her] duties.\" Administrative Leave Letter. That same day, Chioza informed the Ambassador that plaintiff had been placed on administrative leave, stating that there had been \"misunderstandings\" with plaintiff, and that the \"matters were over salary increase and failure on the part of Ms. Barot to carry out her routine work.\" Ex. 23. to Def.'s Mot. [Dkt. # 80-5]. The November 5, 2009 termination letter informed plaintiff that \"following the review of the circumstances that led to [her] being placed on administrative leave ... the Embassy has decided that [her] services are no longer required ....\" Termination Letter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Plaintiff notes that she was paid one month's salary at the time of her termination, and that she would not have been eligible for the payment under her Employment Agreement if she had been terminated for a disciplinary reason. Pl.'s Opp. at 10. She argues that all of her employer's contemporaneous statements and actions are consistent with a non-disciplinary reason for the termination, and that defendant did not \"reverse course and state Ms. Barot was terminated for a disciplinary reason,\" that is, for deleting computer files, until during the later administrative process.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   But the language used in the 2009 documents was quite broad, and the references to the \"circumstances\" on September 9 fairly include both the memorandum and the deletion of the computer files. So plaintiff has not pointed to evidence of \"changes or inconsistencies\" in defendant's stated reasons. Moreover, while the Employment Agreement required the Embassy to give plaintiff one month's notice or one month's salary in lieu of notice if she was fired for a non-disciplinary reason, it did not bar the Embassy from doing so if she was fired for a disciplinary reason.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ex. 1 to Def.'s Mot.

After the meeting, in which plaintiff had agreed to return to her secretarial duties, plaintiff immediately informed her supervisors that the Embassy would need to purchase the paper forms that she had previously devised a computerized form to replace. Mbewe interpreted this as a threat to refuse to use the computerized forms unless the Embassy compensated her for creating them. And plaintiff admitted as much in her deposition. She testified that her job as a secretary only involved paper forms, and that she wanted defendant \"to know that the [computerized] one that [she] did was very useful. They were saving, because ... of what [she] did. So [she] had to be compensated for what [she] did.\" BarotDep. at 123:18-124:3. Concerned by plaintiff's reaction following the meeting, Mbewe logged on to plaintiff's computer to gain access to the electronic versions of the forms. After he looked for the forms in their usual spot and did not find them, Mbewe concluded that plaintiff had deleted them and promptly reported his findings to his supervisor, Mbula. Based on these circumstances, the Embassy decided to place plaintiff on administrative leave and then to terminate her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   While plaintiff has not pointed to any facts that would show that these witnesses have been dishonest about their thoughts that evening, she has come forward with some evidence that gives rise to a genuine dispute of fact concerning the reasonableness of their belief that she deleted the form. Mbewe testified that he and Mbula looked for the voucher file and that since they were unable to locate it, they believed plaintiff had deleted it. But Mbewe admitted that they \"never talked to her\" and \"never asked her\" if she had deleted the voucher template, or if she had just moved the file, and they did not search the computer to ascertain whether there was a log indicating that a file had been erased.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mbewe Dep. at 49:5-15. Meanwhile, plaintiff testified in her deposition and averred in a declaration that she did not delete the file and that she actually used the voucher template on the morning of September 10 to prepare a payment voucher for the Ambassador's car.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Barot Dep. at 112:10-22; Ex. 28 to Pl.'s Opp., Aff. of Dolores Barot [Dkt. # 86-4] (\"Barot Aff\") \u00b6 1.

It was also learnt that she felt that the computerized payment vouchers were her intellectual property. Due to the seriousness of the allegations and the absence from station of then Ambassador Dr. Inonge Mbikusita Lewanika, a decision was made by the mission administration the same night (9th September 2009) to immediately place Ms. Barot on administrative leave (suspension) pending the arrival of the Ambassador....\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-173\">\n    Upon the Ambassador's arrival back to station, she was briefed about what had transpired during her absence and informed that the decision to suspend Ms. Barot was only an interim measure and that due to the seriousness of the alleged offence Administration had decided to recommend that ultimately her employment with the embassy had become untenable and such should be terminated.
