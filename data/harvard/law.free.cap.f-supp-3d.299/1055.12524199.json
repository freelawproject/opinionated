TUNHEIM, Chief Judge\n   Plaintiffs retirement and investment funds (\"Plaintiffs\") bring this consolidated class action alleging that Medtronic, Inc., (\"Medtronic\") and a number of its officers and employees (\"Individual Defendants\") engaged in a scheme to defraud investors. In particular, Plaintiffs allege that Medtronic artificially inflated its stock price by manipulating early clinical studies of two bone-morphogenetic-protein (\"BMP\") products-INFUSE and AMPLIFY. Individual Defendants William A. Hawkins, Gary L. Ellis, Richard E. Kuntz, Dr. Julie Bearcroft, Dr. Richard Treharne, and Dr. Martin Yahiro move for summary judgment for the scheme-liability claims and control-person claims brought against them. The Court will grant in part and deny in part the Individual Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   INFUSE is the \"trade name of rhBMP-2,\" which is a BMP that induces the body to develop new bone tissue.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Am. Comp. (\"Compl.\") \u00b6 7, Nov. 4, 2013, Docket No. 28.) INFUSE is an alternative to grafting replacement bone tissue and was the first BMP to reach the market. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The FDA approved INFUSE in 2002 for what Plaintiffs allege are somewhat limited treatment purposes: degenerative disc disease, dental surgery, and certain shin fractures. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8.) INFUSE is a key part of Medtronic's \"spinal segment\" of business, which generated more than $3.5 billion in revenue in 2008, 2009, and 2010. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20.) Medtronic also sought FDA approval for AMPLIFY, a second-generation BMP. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 22, 24.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The lead Plaintiffs in this case are several institutional investors: West Virginia Pipe Trades Health &amp; Welfare Fund, Union Asset Management Holding AG, and Employees' Retirement System of the State of Hawaii, all of which allege that they purchased Medtronic common stock and were damaged by the conduct alleged in the Complaint. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 43-45.) They bring this action against Medtronic and several of its officers and employees, including: William Hawkins, former Chair of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer (\"CEO\"), (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 47); Gary Ellis, Chief Financial Officer (\"CFO\"), (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 48); Richard Kuntz, Chief Scientific, Clinical, and Regulatory Officer, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 49); Dr. Julie Bearcroft, Director of Technology Management in Medtronic's Biologics Marketing Department, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 50); Dr. Richard Treharne, Senior Vice President of Clinical and Regulatory Affairs, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 51); and Dr. Martin Yahiro, Medtronic Senior Director of Regulatory Affairs, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 52). The Complaint also alleges violations by three consultants (\"Consultant Defendants\"): Dr. Thomas Zdeblick, (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 53); Dr. Kenneth Burkus, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 54); and Dr. Scott Boden, (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 55).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiffs contend that Medtronic engaged in a scheme to manipulate the early clinical studies by omitting many of INFUSE's adverse events. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 162-65.) Plaintiffs allege that early INFUSE clinical studies revealed safety risks that threatened Medtronic's goals for the product and, as a result, Medtronic \"embarked on a scheme with physician investigators and authors to conceal the significant safety\n   risks from the public and physician community.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 15, 163.) They allege that Medtronic did so by \"forg[ing] relationships, including financial relationships, with physician authors who published research articles in respected medical journals and knowingly concealed in those original articles, or omitted altogether, known facts regarding INFUSE's adverse side effects observed in clinical trials,\" and that these research articles \"overstated apparent disadvantages of alternate bone graft procedures ... as opposed to treatment with INFUSE.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16.) Plaintiffs also allege that Medtronic \"failed to disclose that Medtronic had paid millions of dollars to the same physician authors\" and \"heavily edited the articles and specifically excised true facts learned during clinical trials about the efficacy and side effects of INFUSE, which would have alerted the public and physicians using INFUSE about its harmful side effects and lack of clinical benefit.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On June 28, 2011,\n   <em>\n    The Spine Journal\n   </em>\n   released an issue devoted to concerns regarding INFUSE. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 103;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Decl. of Christopher M. Wood (\"Wood Decl.\") \u00b6 54, Ex. 26, Apr. 7, 2015, Docket No. 103.) Plaintiffs contend that, \"[t]aken as a whole, the June 28, 2011 issue of\n   <em>\n    The Spine Journal\n   </em>\n   began to inform the market, for the first time, that the research supporting the safety and efficacy of INFUSE was not reliable.\" (Compl. \u00b6 103.) That same day, Medtronic filed its FY11 Form 10-K, which included a statement about\n   <em>\n    The Spine Journal\n   </em>\n   articles and \"conceded that the articles would have an impact on future sales.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 112.) Plaintiffs contend that these disclosures led to a drop in the value of Medtronic stock. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 113-16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that Medtronic and the Individual Defendants violated Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act by making false and misleading statements to investors (Count I) and by engaging in a scheme to pay physician authors to conceal adverse events associated with INFUSE and AMPLIFY (Count II). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 157-65.) Additionally, Plaintiffs allege that the Individual Defendants are liable under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act as control persons of Medtronic (Count III). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 166-70.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   This is not the Individual Defendants' first effort to dismiss this case. On September 14, 2014, the Court granted in part and denied in part Defendants' motions to dismiss.\n   <em>\n    W. Va. Pipe Trades Health &amp; Welfare Fund v.

The Eighth Circuit disagreed, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   [Plaintiffs] allege conduct beyond mere misrepresentations or omissions actionable under Rule 10b-5(b). [Plaintiffs'] scheme liability claim alleges that Medtronic shaped the content of medical journals by \"pa[ying] physicians ... to induce their complicity in concealing adverse events and side effects associated with the use of INFUSE and overstating the disadvantages of alternative bone graft procedures.\" Although the scheme liability claim also includes allegations that Medtronic edited language in the clinical studies that the physicians ultimately published,\n   <strong>\n    the act of paying physicians to induce their complicity is the allegation at the heart of the scheme liability claim.\n   </strong>\n   Paying someone else to make a misrepresentation is not itself a misrepresentation. Thus, [Plaintiffs] do not merely repackage allegations of misrepresentation as allegations of a scheme.\n   <em>\n    Janus\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    KV Pharmaceuticals\n   </em>\n   require some conduct other than a misrepresentation to support a scheme liability claim.

The crux of the alleged scheme is that Medtronic paid physician authors to conceal adverse events and side effects associated with the use of INFUSE and to overstate the disadvantages of alternative graft procedures.\n   <em>\n    W. Va. Pipe Trades\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12176309\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/845/384/\">\n    845 F.3d at 393\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Plaintiffs cannot maintain their scheme-liability claims by simply producing evidence of\n   <strong>\n    any\n   </strong>\n   misstatement or deceptive act related to INFUSE or AMPLIFY if the act is immaterial to the alleged scheme to pay physician authors to conceal adverse events related to INFUSE.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Plaintiffs have produced evidence of deceptive acts that are not related to the alleged scheme. First, Plaintiffs argue that Hawkins, Ellis, Kuntz, and Bearcroft continued to promote INFUSE's safety and efficacy in an effort to convince the Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services (\"CMS\") to continue Medicare coverage for the use of INFUSE. (Second Mem. in Opp. to Summ. J. (\"Opp. II\") at 31-32, Nov. 15, 2017, Docket No. 433.) Second, Plaintiffs argue that Hawkins and Ellis actively concealed from shareholders the FDA's refusal to allow Medtronic to market AMPLIFY. (Opp. II at 32-33.) Third and finally, Plaintiffs argue that Dr. Treharne prepared Dr. Yahiro for meetings with the FDA. (First Mem. in Opp. to Summ. J (\"Opp. I\") at 22-23, May 19, 2017, Docket No. 278.) These acts may have been deceptive, and they do relate to Medtronic's efforts to market INFUSE and AMPLIFY. However, they do not relate to the relatively narrow scheme-paying physician authors to publish false and misleading journal articles-that constitutes the alleged scheme in this case. The Court therefore will not consider these or other irrelevant deceptive acts in deciding whether an Individual Defendant committed acts in furtherance of the alleged scheme during the repose period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

The Court must decide whether there is a genuine issue of material fact with respect to (1) whether Dr. Treharne committed a deceptive act in furtherance of the alleged scheme during the repose period and (2) whether Dr. Treharne exercised control over Medtronic's operations during the repose period. The Court will grant the Individual Defendants' motion for summary judgment with respect to both claims brought against Dr. Treharne.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    1.

But Plaintiffs have produced a \"Personal Services Agreement\" between Medtronic and Dr. Treharne showing that he continued to provide consulting services after his retirement until August 6, 2009. (Treharne Agreement at 2, 7.) The Court must therefore consider whether any of Dr. Treharne's consulting services conducted from June 27, 2008, to August 6, 2009, concerned the decision to pay physician authors in relation to the alleged scheme.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The Complaint only references acts committed by Dr. Treharne prior to June 27, 2008, and Dr. Treharne testified that he has not performed any consulting related to the publication of articles about INFUSE since his retirement in 2006. (Treharne Dep. at 216:5-15;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 71, 87(i), 129; Treharne Dep. at 216:5-15.) Evidence submitted to the Court shows that Dr. Treharne provided consulting in relation to (1) preparing Dr. Yahiro for meetings with the FDA and (2) assisting Medtronic with a qui tam action related to INFUSE.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   First, Dr. Treharne testified that the majority of his work as a consultant dealt with preparing Medtronic for FDA panel meetings related to AMPLIFY by participating in mock panel meetings. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 80:17-84:20.) The mock panel meetings did not require the submission of clinical trials, and Dr. Treharne testified that he is unaware of what Medtronic submitted to the FDA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 94:10-95:13.) Other evidence shows that Dr. Treharne helped Dr. Yahiro prepare for meetings with the FDA. (Sealed Ex. 19, May 19, 2017, Docket No. 292; Sealed Ex. 20, May 19, 2017, Docket No. 293; Sealed Ex. 21, May 19, 2017, Docket No. 294.) Moreover, most of the evidence is dated before June 27, 2008. The only email exchange that suggests that Dr. Treharne may have been involved during the repose period is a forwarded email to Dr. Treharne about a FDA public-health notice. (Sealed Ex. 21 at 3.) Although Dr. Treharne prepared Medtronic to appear before the FDA on various AMPLIFY-related issues, the Court finds that the evidence does not suggest that this consulting work involved the decision to pay physician authors to publish false information about Medtronic's spinal products.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Second, Dr. Treharne assisted Medtronic in its defense of a qui tam action related to off-label use of INFUSE. Dr. Treharne's testimony suggests that he was deposed in that case. (Treharne Dep. at 73:12-74:16.) The only other evidence of Dr. Treharne's participation in the qui tam action is an email in which Dr. Treharne sent someone a copy of a document that he\n   believed \"the other side [was] asking for.\" (Sealed Ex. 23 at 2, May 19, 2017, Docket No. 296.) The Court finds that serving as a witness in a qui tam action is not a deceptive act related to the alleged scheme.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Plaintiffs, the Individual Defendants have satisfied their burden of demonstrating that there is no genuine issue of material fact that Dr. Treharne did not commit a deceptive act in furtherance of the alleged scheme during the repose period.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201658\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1658\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2). Accordingly, the Court will grant the Individual Defendants' motion for summary judgment with respect to the scheme-liability claim brought against Dr. Treharne and will dismiss Count II with respect to him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Control Person Liability\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The Court must decide whether there is a genuine issue of material fact with respect to whether Dr. Treharne acted as a control person of Medtronic during the repose period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   To be liable as a control person, Dr. Treharne must have controlled the general operations of Medtronic during the repose period.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Metge\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"366164\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/762/621/#p631\">\n    762 F.2d at 631\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . During the repose period, Dr. Treharne merely served as a consultant. The consulting agreement specifies that Dr. Treharne will \"provide regulatory and clinical consulting services\" to Medtronic, and does not suggest that Treharne had any role in managing Medtronic. (Treharne Agreement at 2.) In fact, the agreement specifies that Dr. Treharne is an independent contractor and \"may not incur any liability on [Medtronic's] behalf nor bind [Medtronic] to any contractual or payment obligation without the prior written consent of [Medtronic].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-5.) The Court finds that the evidence firmly establishes that Dr. Treharne did not exercise control over the operations of Medtronic after his retirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Additionally, to be liable as a control person, Dr. Treharne must have possessed the power to control Medtronic's decision to pay the physician authors, even if he did not exercise such authority.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Metge\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"366164\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/762/621/#p631\">\n    762 F.2d at 631\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Again, Dr. Treharne's consulting agreement establishes that he did not have authority to bind Medtronic to any sort of agreement with the physician authors. As discussed above, the Court finds that there is no evidence that Dr. Treharne participated in the alleged scheme during the repose period, much less exercised any amount of control over the scheme.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Accordingly, the Court will grant the Individual Defendants' motion for summary judgment with respect to the control-person liability claim brought against Dr. Treharne and will dismiss Count II with respect to him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Dr. Martin Yahiro\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Dr. Yahiro worked at Medtronic from 2003 to 2011 as Senior Director of Clinical and Regulatory Affairs. (Sealed Ex. 2 (\"Yahiro Dep.\") at 21:12-15, 27:2-11, Nov. 30, 2017, Docket No. 477; Compl. \u00b6 52.) During this time, he was tasked with managing various submissions to the FDA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27:21-30:5.) Dr. Yahiro worked to obtain FDA approval to expand INFUSE's approved uses and helped design clinical trials to further this goal.

At his deposition, Dr. Yahiro testified about an \"Infuse Bone Graft TLIF Pivotal Study Design Pre-IDE Meeting\" that purportedly occurred on June 29, 2009, which he attended. (Yahiro Dep. at 194:3-7, 195:10-19.) A PowerPoint slide from that meeting states, \"FDA Comments: FDA is extremely concerned, concerned that this study design raises concerns about bias and likely differences in both the surgeons and patients who will end up in each treatment arm.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 196:6-11.) Additionally, a PowerPoint slide prepared by McKinsey &amp; Company-who Medtronic retained to consult with on strategies related to INFUSE-lists Dr. Yahiro on both the \"TLIF trial design\" and \"Clinical strategy\" teams. (Sealed Ex. 18 at 8, May 19, 2017, Docket No. 291; Yahiro Dep. at 207:8-11.) Medtronic hoped to design studies that would demonstrate (1) \"BMP-2 is safe and efficacious relative to alternative therapies for a given indication,\" (2) \"[p]atient care is improved in an overall more cost effective manner, and (3) \"BMP-2 is safe for patients, easy to use, improves outcomes and limits liability.\" (Sealed Ex. 18 at 23.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The Court finds that Dr. Yahiro's participation in these meetings suggests-as is concomitant with his job description-that Dr. Yahiro was involved in designing trials to seek expansion of INFUSE's uses during the repose period. Admittedly, this evidence does not show precisely how involved Dr. Yahiro was in designing these trials, whether he was engaged in selecting physician authors for these studies, and/or whether he asked physician authors to conceal certain results from the clinical trials. At trial, Plaintiffs would need to produce significantly more evidence about Dr. Yahiro's involvement in the alleged scheme. Yet, on this motion for summary judgment, the Individual Defendants have the burden of proving why they are entitled to judgment as a matter of law on their statute-of-repose defense.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Integrity Floorcovering, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5702352\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/503/1136/#p1139\">\n    503 F.Supp.2d at 1139\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

As Senior Director of Clinical and Regulatory Affairs, Dr. Yahiro's work responsibilities involved preparing regulatory submissions to the FDA and designing clinical studies. (Yahiro Dep. at 27:21-28:16.) Dr. Yahiro was not even the most executive manager within the managerial hierarchy of Clinical Affairs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 30:6-31:9.) The\n   Court finds that neither his duties nor his position even remotely suggests that Dr. Yahiro exercised general control over the operations of Medtronic.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Metge\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"366164\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/762/621/#p631\">\n    762 F.2d at 631\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Sufficient evidence suggests that Dr. Yahiro might have been\n   <strong>\n    involved\n   </strong>\n   in the decision to pay physician authors. However, the Court is not persuaded that the evidence creates a genuine issue of fact that Dr. Yahiro had the authority to\n   <strong>\n    control\n   </strong>\n   the decision to pay the physician authors. Control-person liability necessitates much more than mere the participation in a scheme; it requires control over the decision to engage in a fraudulent scheme and the ability to prevent the company from making that decision.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"366164\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/762/621/#p631\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Accordingly, the Court will grant the Individual Defendants' motion for summary judgment with respect to the control-person claim brought against Dr. Yahiro and will dismiss Count III with respect to him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

(Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 1, 49, 168.) Submitted evidence details only one act committed by Kuntz during the repose period. Plaintiffs have submitted evidence that Kuntz spoke at a meeting with Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (\"CMS\") regarding \"the clinical benefits and harms of on-label and off-label use of BMPs.\" (Sealed Ex. 67 at 143, Nov. 15, 2017, Docket No. 468; Sealed Ex. 59, Nov. 15, 2017, Docket No. 461.)

His title alone is insufficient evidence. Plaintiffs may not rest on mere allegations that Kuntz had the ability to control Medtronic's decision to hire certain physician authors or ask them to conceal certain adverse events.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206897\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/242/#p248\">\n    477 U.S. at 256\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206897\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/242/#p248\">\n    106 S.Ct. 2505\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Court must decide whether there is a genuine issue of material fact with respect to (1) whether Hawkins committed a deceptive act in furtherance of the alleged scheme during the repose period and (2) whether Hawkins exercised control over Medtronic's operations during the repose period.

According to Hawkins, this payment was strictly for intellectual property acquired from Dr. Boden and was not related to Dr. Boden's journal articles. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 193:8-15.) Dr. Boden's deposition and emails establish that this intellectual property related to patents for which he received royalties from Medtronic. (Sealed Ex. 9 at 3, Nov. 30, 2017, Docket No. 484; Sealed Ex. 5 at 70:12-23, Nov. 30, 2017, Docket No. 480.) No contrary evidence suggests that this payment was made in an effort to conceal the alleged scheme. The Court finds that the evidence submitted establishes that this payment was for the rights to patents owned by Dr. Boden and not for Dr. Boden's work as a physician consultant. The\n   Court therefore concludes that Hawkins's approval of this payment does not constitute a deceptive act committed in furtherance of the alleged scheme.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Plaintiffs also point to a \"letter of the day\" penned by Hawkins in the\n   <em>\n    Star Tribune\n   </em>\n   , which argued, \"The suggestion that doctors are paid to use our products is simply untrue.\" (Sealed Ex. 71 at 241, Nov. 15, 2017, Docket No. 468.) This letter does not address allegations that Medtronic paid physician authors to write fraudulent articles. Instead, this article addresses allegations that Medtronic paid physicians to treat patients with specific Medtronic products. While Hawkins's statements might have been deceptive, the Court finds that these statements were not made in furtherance of the scheme alleged in this case. Moreover, the Court is not certain-without further evidence of other acts-that this allegedly false statement could be used to maintain a claim of scheme liability against Hawkins.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    W.

Dr. Burkus's January 2009 report listed Dr. Bearcroft as the contact for \"Work on Mastergraft BMP JBJS Manuscript,\" \"Amplify 2-Level Study Investigator's Meeting,\" \"Work on abstract 'Multi-level Instrumented Posterolateral Fusions using A New rhBMP-2 Formulation and Compression Resistant Matrix,\" and \"Work on BMP Antibody Formation manuscript.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 92-94.) Dr. Burkus's April 2009 report listed Dr. Bearcroft as the contact for \"Work on letter to the editor re: 'Use of rhBMP-2 in Combination with Structural Cortical Allografts : Clinical and Radiographic Outcomes in Anterior Lumbar Spinal Surgery\" and \"JBJS galley proofs on BMP MasterGraft manuscript.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 98, 102.) The Court finds that this evidence demonstrates that Dr. Bearcroft was involved in approving payments for publications written by Dr. Burkus about BMP within the repose period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Dr. Bearcroft testified that she was periodically \"asked to review a consulting report to verify or not whether an activity took place\" but \"did not approve the payment.\" (Bearcroft Dep. 54 at 294:14-23.) Dr. Bearcroft testified, \"My role was just to verify whether an activity took place. I didn't make a judgment as far as payment was concerned.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 301:20-24.) The Individual Defendants rely on the fact that approval of Dr. Burkus's activities took place cannot equate to approval of payment. The Court is unpersuaded. Other evidence suggests that these activities related to concealing adverse events in forthcoming studies. To the extent that the Individual Defendants may be correct that the two should not be equated, that is a question of material fact not suitable for resolution at summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   The Individual Defendants argue that Dr. Burkus's studies published within the repose period are not deceptive. But\n   <em>\n    The Spine Journal\n   </em>\n   casts doubts on the truthfulness of Dr. Burkus's studies. One article in\n   <em>\n    The Spine Journal\n   </em>\n   states, \"The FDA data reports more complications than either the 2003 or 2009 publication by Burkus et al.\" (Sealed Ex. 66 at 31, Nov. 15, 2017, Docket No. 468 (footnotes omitted).) The article notes that Dr. Burkus's 2009 study did not report a higher rate of retrograde ejaculation compared to other studies. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The article also mentions Dr. Burkus's Letter to the Editor, stating that Dr. Burkus \"denied any potential association of this complication [retrograde ejaculation] with the use of rhBMP-2.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n   <em>\n    The Spine Journal\n   </em>\n   article concluded that \"retrospective review of complications and adverse events as reported in FDA and other documents suggests the true risk to patients\n   receiving rhBMP-2 is conservatively 10 to 50 times the original estimates calculated from industry-sponsored publications.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 40.) At a minimum,\n   <em>\n    The Spine Journal\n   </em>\n   called into question the legitimacy of Dr. Burkus's 2009 study and could lead a reasonable jury to conclude that these studies were the product of the alleged scheme to conceal adverse events associated with Medtronic's spine products.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   The Court therefore finds that there is a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether Dr. Bearcroft committed a deceptive act in furtherance of the alleged scheme while working with physician consultants. Accordingly, the Court will deny the Individual Defendants' motion for summary judgment with respect to the scheme-liability claim brought against Dr. Bearcroft.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Control-Person Liability\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   The Court must also decide whether there is a genuine issue of material fact with respect to whether Dr. Bearcroft acted as a control person of Medtronic during the repose period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   To be liable as a control person, Dr. Bearcroft must have controlled the general operations of Medtronic during the repose period.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Metge\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"366164\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/762/621/#p631\">\n    762 F.2d at 631\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Dr. Bearcroft was an employee within the Medtronic's spine division, and was continuously managed by higher-level management within this group. (Bearcroft Dep. at 26:23-29:16.) The Court finds that there is no evidence to suggest that Dr. Bearcroft exercised control over the general operations of Medtronic.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Accordingly, the Court will grant the Individual Defendants' motion for summary judgment with respect to the control-person claim brought against Dr. Bearcroft and will dismiss Count III against her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDER\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Based on the foregoing, and all the files, records, and proceedings herein,\n   <strong>\n    IT IS HEREBY ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that Defendants' Renewed Motion for Summary Judgment as to Individual Defendants [Docket No. 259] is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED in PART and DENIED in PART\n   </strong>\n   as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   1.
