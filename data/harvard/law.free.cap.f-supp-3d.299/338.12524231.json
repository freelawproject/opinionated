Walbridge also completed the Opt In Form for overdraft transactions (\"Opt In Agreement\"). His claims in this case arise from overdraft fees charged by Northeast based on the \"available balance\" in his account rather than the balance shown on the account, called the \"ledger balance\" or \"actual balance.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The difference between the available balance and the actual balance results from the way Northeast credits deposits made to an account and reduces the balance by debits that are pending but not yet paid. As a result, the available balance can be less, and even considerably less, than the actual balance, depending on the delay in crediting deposits and the anticipatory deductions of pending debits. Northeast then assesses an overdraft fee when the available balance is insufficient to cover a transaction, even though the actual balance shows enough money to cover the transaction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Walbridge alleges that on March 15, 2016, he had an actual balance in his Northeast checking account of $111.09. He made a debit card payment of $32.43, which left a balance of $78.66. Northeast, however, determined that he had insufficient funds and charged an overdraft fee of $32.00. Northeast then assessed additional overdraft fees of $32.00 on March 29 and March 30, 2016. Walbridge believes that subsequent improper overdraft fees were charged but provides no allegations in support.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Walbridge alleges that Northeast breached the Account and Opt In Agreements and the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing by charging him overdraft fees when the actual balance showed there was money in his account to cover the transactions. He also brings equitable claims for unjust enrichment and money had and received. In addition, Walbridge alleges that Northeast violated Regulation E of EFTA by failing to disclose its overdraft policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Northeast moves to dismiss Walbridge's breach of contract claims and EFTA claim on the grounds that it did not promise to use the actual balance for its overdraft service and instead properly explained its overdraft policy based on the available balance. Northeast moves to dismiss the EFTA claim on the merits and asserts that the claim is barred by the statute of limitations and the \"safe harbor\" provision. Northeast moves to dismiss the equitable claims because valid contracts control the issues raised. Walbridge objects to the motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Breach of Contract\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Walbridge contends that Northeast breached the Opt In Agreement by assessing\n   overdraft fees when there was enough money in his account to cover the transaction. He contends that Northeast breached the Account Agreement because it promised to assess overdraft fees only when there were insufficient funds in the account to cover a transaction but instead assessed overdraft fees based on the available balance. Northeast asserts that no breach occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Under New Hampshire law, \"[a] breach of contract occurs when there is a failure without legal excuse to perform any promise which forms the whole or part of a contract.\"\n   <em>\n    Audette v.

The Opt In Agreement pertains to the standard practices. The Agreement does not define or explain what is meant by the phrase: \"when you do not have enough money in your account to cover a transaction.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Walbridge argues that the plain meaning of the promise in the Opt In Agreement is that an overdraft would occur only when there was not enough money in the account, as shown by the actual balance, to cover the transaction. Northeast argues that the Opt In Agreement is part of the Account Agreement and must be read in conjunction with that Agreement. Based on reading the Agreements together, Northeast contends that the plain meaning of \"enough money\" is the available balance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Standing alone, the Opt In Agreement does not sufficiently define or explain the term \"enough money\" to put account holders on notice that \"enough money\" means the available balance.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chambers v.

The Opt In Agreement also does not specifically reference the Account Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On the other hand, there would be no need for overdraft protection, provided in the Opt In Agreement, in the absence of an account at Northeast that is established through an Account Agreement. The Account Agreement refers to the Opt In Agreement as the source for certain overdraft protections.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although the Agreements are separate, they are arguably linked with respect to an account holder's overdraft protection.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203597522\">\n    2017 WL 3597522\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5. For purposes of the current motion to dismiss, the court will consider the promise made in the Opt In Agreement in the context of the Account Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Account Agreement\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Account Agreement includes several sections pertaining to available funds and overdrafts. Section 3.7 explains that Northeast can refuse to allow a withdrawal \"if the amount requested is not yet available for withdrawal.\" Doc. 8-4 at 3. Section 3.10, titled \"Nonsufficient Funds,\" states: \"If you write a check for more money than you have in your account, you will be deemed to be overdrawn and [Northeast] may refuse to honor the check and return it as unpaid for reason of nonsufficient funds (NSF).\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4. Neither section defines \"available for withdrawal\" or \"more money than you have in your account.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   More specific to overdrafts, section 3.35, titled \"Paying of Overdrafts,\" states that \"at its sole discretion, [Northeast] may honor items presented for payment or authorization against your account even if there are insufficient funds in your account.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6. The provision explains what items may and may not be honored and that a fee will be charged when payments are made. The remainder of the provision provides the process of notification, consequences for failure to correct a \"negative balance,\" and the procedures for collecting amounts owed. The term \"insufficient funds\" is not defined.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Appended to the Account Agreement is another document titled \"Northeast Credit Union Combined Disclosure Agreement.\" One of the six parts of the Disclosure Agreement is titled \"Truth-in-Savings Disclosure for Personal Savings &amp; Transaction Accounts,\" which includes a provision titled \"Funds Availability Policy for Personal and Business Accounts.\" Doc. 8-4, at 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The Funds Availability Policy explains when deposits become available for use and that not all deposited funds are available for withdrawal or to pay checks as soon as they are deposited. There does not appear to be any reference in that provision to the overdraft payment section of the Account Agreement or to the overdraft protection offered in the Opt In Agreement. Neither the Account Agreement nor the Opt In Agreement refers customers to the Disclosure Agreement to find definitions or explanations of what balance is used for purposes of overdraft protection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Northeast contends that the cited parts of the Account Agreement and the Disclosure Agreement make it clear that the terms \"insufficient funds\" and \"enough money\" mean available funds and that the Funds Availability Policy in the Disclosure Agreement explains that deposits are not\n   always immediately available for use. Walbridge contends that the terms used plainly mean the actual balance and that Northeast's references to other provisions in the Account Agreement and the Disclosure Agreement do not show that a reasonable person would have understood those terms meant available balance. Walbridge also notes that nothing in the Account Agreement or the Disclosure Agreement explains Northeast's policy of reducing the actual balance by pending debits, which can result in an even lower available balance for purposes of determining when overdrafts occur.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Other courts have considered similar breach of contract claims arising from financial institutions' practices of charging overdraft fees based on available balances and have come to differing conclusions. Northeast relies on\n   <em>\n    Tims v. LGE Community Credit Union\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%205133230\">\n    2017 WL 5133230\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (N.D.

In\n   <em>\n    Tims\n   </em>\n   , the court found that references to the availability of deposited funds in a section of the Account Agreement titled \"Payment Order of Your Transactions\" and in the Disclosure Agreement to conclude that \"the parties intended 'sufficient' and 'enough' to mean the available balance method.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Tims\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%205133230\">\n    2017 WL 5133230\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Chambers\n   </em>\n   , the parties disputed whether the language in the Opt In Agreement promised to use the actual balance or the available balance for assessing an overdraft.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12270865\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/222/1/#p10\">\n    222 F.Supp.3d at 10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . There, the court found that the opening paragraph of the Opt In Agreement provided examples to explain when an account did not have \"enough money\" and used the term \"available balance\" in the explanations.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12270865\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/222/1/#p10\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Account Agreement at issue in that case also included a section that addressed \"Available Balances to Make Transactions\" that the court found \"unambiguously link[ed] overdrafts to the available balance.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12270865\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/222/1/#p10\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12270865\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/222/1/#p10\">\n    at 11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In this case, the Opt In Agreement does not include the examples and explanations that were provided in\n   <em>\n    Chambers\n   </em>\n   nor are there repeated references in the Account Agreement that link overdrafts to available balances or clearly show the parties' intent that the terms used meant available balance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Walbridge relies on a series of cases in which courts have found that the language used in similar Opt In Agreements and Account Agreements is ambiguous as to what constitutes enough money in the account or sufficient funds for purposes of assessing overdraft fees. In\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   , the court concluded that the terms used in the Opt In Agreement and Account Agreement to describe the balance used for the overdraft policy were ambiguous and could have referred to either the actual balance or the available balance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203597522\">\n    2017 WL 3597522\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at 7. Similarly, in\n   <em>\n    Ramirez v.

In addition, as the court noted in\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   , the agreements here are long, twenty-four pages in total, and Northeast relies on scattered references to available funds while using other terms that it does not define. The terms Northeast used, in the absence of clear definitions or explanations, could reasonably be understood to mean the actual balance, as other courts have found.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Northeast has not shown that the only reasonable meaning of \"enough money,\" \"insufficient funds,\" and \"nonsufficient funds\" is the available balance. The Account Agreement and the Opt In Agreement could be reasonably understood to promise that overdraft fees would be charged only if a customer overdrew the actual balance in the account. Therefore, Walbridge states claims for breach of the Opt In and the Account Agreements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Breach of the Implied Duty of Good Faith and Fair Dealing\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Northeast moves to dismiss the implied duty claim on the ground that it is premised on erroneous interpretations of the Opt In Agreement and the Account Agreement. Based on its own interpretations of the Agreements, Northeast asserts\n   that its overdraft fee policy did not breach the implied duty. As is explained above, Northeast has not shown that the Agreements promised to charge overdrafts based on the available balance.
