The defendants are also in the flour business, at Catasaqua, JPa., and make use of the word \u201cCressota\u201d on a brand of their flour, thereby infringing, as it is claimed, on the complainants\u2019 rights. That \u201cCressota\u201d is an infringement of \u201cCere-sota\u201d needs no argument. Indeed, the resemblance is so close as to suggest that it is deliberate. Intentional infringement, however, is denied; it being explained that \u201cCressota\u201d is derived from the name of Mr. Cressman, one of the defendants, who is familiarly known to his friends as \u201cCress,\u201d and the suffix \u201cota\u201d being a common one in flour trade-marks, taken from, if not indicative of, the great wheat-producing states of the Northwest. But, even if this be accepted as something more than a specious explanation, it does not do away with the fact of infringement, which is clearly made out, and from which the defendants must therefore desist.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-4\">It is said, however, that \u201cCeresota\u201d is a descriptive term, and (except as brought within the recent act of Congress) not capable, therefore, of being adopted as a trade-mark, being derived from \u201cCeres,\u201d the goddess of grain, from which we get the common word \u201ccereal,\u201d with \u201cota\u201d added, the ending, as already noted, of the names of the great grain states of Minnesota and the two Dakotas, with which, as it is said, it has come to be identified. \u201cCeresota,\u201d according to this, would thus be understood to mean, without more, a flour produced from grain grown in that section of the country. But this is altogether strained and fanciful. The first part of the word, no doubt, is derived, somwhat happily, as applied to flour, from the name of the goddess. But that there is any such meaning as is .claimed for the termination \u201cota,\u201d or that it is capable of being made out of it, is not to be credited. It is possible that under the lead of the complainants, through the use of the very word here in controversy, this ending may have come to be adopted by others in the flour business as a part of their trade-marks. But that affords no proof of any such inherent or acquired sense as is contended for, so as, to make it descriptive, either by itself or in combination. \u201cCeresota\u201d is plainly a made-up word, and, having been coined and adopted by the complainants as a trade-mark in their business, they are entitled to the exclusive use of it, without being interfered with by others imitating it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-5\">I,et a preliminary injunction issue as prayed for.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1019-6\"> Specially assigned.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
