BROWN, Chief Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1216-24\">On November 12, 1971, Richard Williams was sentenced, pursuant to a verdict of guilty after trial by jury, to fifteen (15) years imprisonment for violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He filed a motion to vacate and set aside the sentence, asserting that at the time of sentencing he was twenty (20) years old and that the lower court failed to state expressly that it had determined that Williams would not benefit from treatment under the Youthful Corrections Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5010(b) or (c).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1216-25\">Upon receipt of Williams\u2019 motion the lower court supplemented its original order by making a specific finding that at the time of sentencing as well as at the time of supplementing, Williams would not benefit from treatment under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1217-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1155\">*1155</page-number>Williams contends that the \u201cno benefit\u201d finding must appear in the record at the time of sentencing and may not be added by amendment. He cites <em>Dorszynski </em>v. <em>United States, </em>418 U.S. 424, 94 S.Ct. 3042, 41 L.Ed.2d 855 (1974). While it is true that in <em>Dorszynski, </em>the Court held that an affirmative finding of no benefit must appear in the record, it went on to state that, \u201cP]iteral compliance with the Act can be satisfied by any expression that makes clear the sentencing judge considered the alternative of sentencing under the Act and decided that the youth offender would not derive benefit from treatment under the Act.\u201d 418 U.S. at 444, 94 S.Ct. at 3053. The lower court record, as supplemented, meets that requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1217-5\">This Court has approved the procedure whereby the District Court supplements the record and makes a finding of \u201cno benefit\u201d after the fact of sentencing. <em>See U. S. </em>v. <em>Dover, </em>5 Cir., 1974, 489 F.2d 688; <em>U. S. v. Usher, </em>5 Cir., 1974, 493 F.2d 1356, on remand, 500 F.2d 388; <em>U. S. </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>5 Cir., 1975, 522 F.2d 207. The lower court has made the finding of \u201cno benefit\u201d. Williams is entitled to nothing more.</p>\n<p id=\"b1217-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1216-14\">. \u00a7 2113.
