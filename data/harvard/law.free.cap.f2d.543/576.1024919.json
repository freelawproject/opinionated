Citizens Casualty Co. of New York et al., </em>5 Cir., 1970, 431 F.2d 409, Part I.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b638-23\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b638-24\">When about three months were left in Appellant Phipps\u2019 prison term, the government transferred him to a Federal \u201cpre-release\u201d center. At that time, officials of the center explained to Phipps that he could leave during the day after signing out, but that he must return each night. On September 4, 1975, six weeks before his scheduled release date, Phipps failed to return after signing out first for 8 p. m., and later for 11 p. m. The police located him on December 7, 1975, and arrested him for violations of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4082(d) and 751: escape from a federal community center. Phipps appeals from the jury verdict of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>guilty, claiming that the trial judge erred in denying his motion for acquittal made at the close of the government\u2019s evidence, since the government allegedly failed to prove he had the specific intent to escape. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">First, Phipps\u2019 appeal fails because of the rule that where, as here, a defendant puts on evidence after moving for acquittal under F.R.Crim.P. 29(a), he waives objection to the denial of that motion unless he renews his motion at the close of all the evidence. <em>United States v. Perez, </em>526 F.2d 859 (5 Cir. 1976); <em>United States v. Edwards, </em>488 F.2d 1154 (5 Cir. 1974). No renewed motion was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">An exception to the above rule has been suggested where to deny the appeal would further a manifest miscarriage of justice. <em>United States v. Perez, </em>526 F.2d 859 (5 Cir. 1976) (dicta). If it exists, the exception does not apply here. The evidence in the instant case supports the jury verdict and does not result in a manifest injustice. The procedures of the center were well-known to Phipps. Despite his asserted illiteracy and low intelligence, he demonstrated his understanding of the signout procedure by returning on the day he escaped long enough to change the time. He never made any attempt to return during the entire three-months period. Appellant insists that he did not escape \u201cwillfully\u201d because he left upset and confused over the alleged death of his brother (still unconfirmed). Needless to say, however, the government\u2019s proof does not have to show that he intended to escape at the moment he left the correction center. <em>Chandler v. United States, </em>378 F.2d 906, 907-08 (9 Cir. 1967). The jury could fairly have inferred that Phipps formed the requisite intent later, although still \u201con or about the 4th day of September, 1975,\u201d as the indictment charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
