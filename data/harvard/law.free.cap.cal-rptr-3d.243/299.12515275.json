J.\n </judges>\n <opinion>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Under the Labor Code, an employee who believes he or she has not been paid the wages due under the applicable labor statutes and wage orders may bring a civil action against his or her employer. (See, e.g., Lab. Code, \u00a7 1194 ;\n   <em>\n    Martinez v. Combs\n   </em>\n   (2010)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3905026\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-4th/49/35/#p49\">\n    49 Cal.4th 35\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 49-51,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=109%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20514\">\n    109 Cal.Rptr.3d 514\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=231%20P.3d%20259\">\n    231 P.3d 259\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; see also Lab. Code, \u00a7 2699.) This case presents the question whether, when an employer hires an independent payroll service provider (hereafter payroll company) to take over all the payroll tasks that would otherwise be performed by an internal payroll department, the employee may bring a civil action against not only his or her employer but against the payroll company as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Court of Appeal, while agreeing with prior appellate court decisions that a payroll company cannot properly be considered an employer of the hiring business's employee that may be liable under the applicable labor statutes for failure to pay wages that are due, held that the employee may nonetheless maintain causes of action for unpaid wages against the payroll company for (1) breach of the payroll company's contract with the employer under the third party beneficiary doctrine, (2) negligence, and (3) negligent misrepresentation. We granted review to determine the validity of the Court of Appeal's conclusions with respect to these three causes of action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   For the reasons discussed hereafter, we disagree with the Court of Appeal's conclusion\n   as to each of the proposed causes of action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   First, we conclude that the Court of Appeal erred in holding that an employee may maintain a breach of contract action against the payroll company under the third party beneficiary doctrine. As explained, under California's third party beneficiary doctrine, a third party - that is, an individual or entity that is not a party to a contract - may bring a breach of contract action against a party to a contract only if the third party establishes not only (1) that it is likely to benefit from the contract, but also (2) that a motivating purpose of the contracting parties\n   is to provide a benefit to the third party, and further (3) that permitting the third party to bring its own breach of contract action against a contracting party is consistent with the objectives of the contract and the reasonable expectations of the contracting parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Here, we conclude that whether or not a contract between an employer and a payroll company will in fact generally benefit employees with regard to the wages they receive, providing a benefit to its employees with regard to the wages they receive is ordinarily not a motivating purpose of the contracting parties. Instead, the relevant motivating purpose of the contracting parties is to provide a benefit\n   <em>\n    to the employer\n   </em>\n   . In addition, permitting each employee to name the payroll company as an additional defendant in any wage and hour lawsuit an employee may pursue would impose considerable litigation defense costs on the payroll company that inevitably would be passed on to the employer through an increased cost of the payroll company's services, a result that would not be consistent with the objectives of the contract and the reasonable expectations of the employer or payroll company. Accordingly, we conclude that an employee should not be viewed as a third party beneficiary who may maintain an action against the payroll company for an alleged breach of the contract between the employer and the payroll company with regard to the payment of wages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Second, we conclude that the Court of Appeal also erred in determining that an employee who alleges that he or she has not been paid wages that are due may maintain tort causes of action for negligence and negligent misrepresentation against a payroll company. As we explain, in light of a variety of policy considerations that are present in the wage and hour setting, we conclude that it is neither necessary nor appropriate to impose upon a payroll company a tort duty of care with regard to the obligations owed to an employee under the applicable labor statutes and wage orders and consequently that the negligence and negligent misrepresentation causes of action lack merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Accordingly, we conclude that the decision of the Court of Appeal should be reversed insofar as it held that plaintiff employee in this case may proceed against defendant payroll company on causes of action for breach of contract, negligence, and negligent misrepresentation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS BELOW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Trial Court Proceedings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In April 2012, plaintiff Sharmalee Goonewardene (plaintiff) filed the initial complaint in the underlying proceeding against her former employer, Altour International, Inc. (Altour), alleging causes of action for wrongful termination, breach of contract, violations of the Labor Code and related causes of action. The complaint alleged that Altour failed to pay plaintiff the wages she was due under the Labor Code and applicable wage order and wrongfully terminated her when she brought this failure to Altour's attention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   After the trial court sustained a number of demurrers with leave to amend, plaintiff filed a fourth amended complaint (4AC). In addition to the numerous claims against Altour, the 4AC included a new, single cause of action against ADP, LLC (ADP), a payroll company that provided payroll services to Altour,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   alleging that ADP had engaged in unfair business practices under the Unfair Competition Law based on its alleged failure to provide plaintiff with adequate documentation and records regarding her compensation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   After ADP demurred to the 4AC, plaintiff notified the court that she wanted to assert additional claims against ADP, and the court deferred ruling on ADP's demurrer to the 4AC to permit plaintiff to file a motion for leave to file a fifth amended complaint (5AC). Plaintiff thereafter filed such a motion, indicating that she intended to assert claims of wrongful termination, breach of contract, unfair business practices, false advertising, negligence, and negligent misrepresentation against Altour and ADP. The trial court then sustained ADP's demurrer to the 4AC and\n   its opposition to the motion for leave to file a 5AC with regard to any claim that was based on the premise that ADP could properly be considered a joint employer of plaintiff but permitted plaintiff to file a 5AC on the remaining claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Thereafter, plaintiff filed a 5AC, but notwithstanding the trial court's prior ruling, the 5AC included claims based on ADP's alleged status as a joint employer of plaintiff as well as additional claims based on other legal theories. In June 2015, the trial court sustained ADP's demurrer to the 5AC\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   without leave to amend with regard to all causes of action and directed ADP to prepare a final order reflecting its ruling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   While that order was pending, plaintiff submitted a motion for reconsideration and for permission to file a sixth amended complaint (6AC) that closely resembled the 5AC but included a few additional factual allegations. In August 2016, without explicitly ruling on the motion for reconsideration and permission to file the 6AC, the trial court entered a final order sustaining ADP's demurrer to the 5AC on all causes of action without leave to amend. The trial court subsequently entered a judgment dismissing plaintiff's action against ADP.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Court of Appeal Decision\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On appeal of the dismissal of the action against ADP, the Court of Appeal confined its review to the question whether the trial court had erred in sustaining ADP's demurrer to the 5AC without leave to amend, effectively denying plaintiff the opportunity to have the allegations contained in the proposed 6AC considered to determine whether those allegations are sufficient to state causes of action.

Since 2000, ADP's advertising and corporate statements have stated that it provides payroll-related services to employers and employees. ADP offers to 'serve as an extension of [an employer's] payroll department and [to] take over all [the employer's] payroll tasks.' ADP holds itself out as possessing specialized knowledge regarding the calculation of wages under applicable wage laws and regulations, and states that it 'can save employer[s] money by calculating their payroll.' ADP's Web site advertises its expertise in tracking employee work hours,\n   determining wages, and preparing payrolls in accordance with applicable laws. According to the Web site, ADP provides ' \"self-service tools\" ' allowing employees to view their attendance, vacation benefits, and time card approvals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \"At some point, ADP entered into an unwritten contract with Altour, which provides travel-related services. Under that agreement, ADP calculated payrolls, maintained employee records, offered legal advice, and provided other wage-related services for the benefit of Altour and its employees. According to the 6AC, ADP entered into 'a partnership or joint venture with Altour for the purpose of handling Altour's payroll and maintaining records and confidential information regarding Altour's employees.'

[Plaintiff] 'logged directly into an ADP system to track her earnings.'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \"From 2005 to 2012, [plaintiff] did not receive the compensation due her, including overtime compensation, and she was denied meal and rest breaks required under Labor Code section 226.7....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \"Under ADP's agreement with Altour, the 6AC alleges, ADP maintained [plaintiff's] earnings records, added the hours on her time cards, calculated her earnings, and provided her with an earnings statement. ADP also was responsible for determining whether appellant was to receive, inter alia, overtime or double time (that is, overtime reflecting a doubled hourly rate of pay), in accordance with applicable labor laws. ADP alone was responsible for maintaining [plaintiff's] records relating to her compensation, adding the hours shown on her time cards, and applying the labor laws to determine her wages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \"ADP failed to act with 'even scant care' in calculating [plaintiff's] wages. (Underscoring omitted.) Her earnings statements provided by ADP never contained a breakdown of her regular hours, overtime hours or double overtime hours, and did not reflect data regarding meal and rest breaks. Although her time cards reflected facts requiring the payment of double-time compensation, she received no such payment. She was paid twice a month on a basis that was intentionally confusing and did not comply with the wage orders of the Industrial Welfare Commission (IWC). According to the 6AC, Altour and ADP knew that\n   [plaintiff] was not being paid in accordance with California law.\n   \"[Plaintiff] reasonably relied on the earnings statements provided to her. In 2010, she noticed disparities between her own bookkeeping and her hours worked, as shown on her paychecks. In January 2012, she was terminated.

The 6AC further alleges that ADP failed to comply with its obligations under the contract by negligently failing to provide plaintiff with paychecks and pay stubs that accurately reflected the wages she was due under the applicable labor statutes and wage orders. The Court of Appeal agreed with plaintiff that the allegations in the 6AC are sufficient to support a breach of contract action by plaintiff against ADP under the third party beneficiary doctrine.

In\n   <em>\n    Li\n   </em>\n   , the specific question before the court was whether Civil Code section 1714, which set forth the common law doctrine of contributory negligence under which a plaintiff's negligent conduct operated to completely bar any\n   recovery by the plaintiff against a negligent defendant, should properly be interpreted to preclude this court from adopting as a common law rule the doctrine of comparative negligence under which a plaintiff's negligence reduces, but does not totally bar, a plaintiff's recovery\n   against a negligent defendant. This court concluded that section 1714 should not properly be interpreted to preclude this court from adopting comparative negligence as the prevailing California common law rule. The court explained: \"[I]t was not the intention of the Legislature in enacting section 1714 of the Civil Code,\n   <em>\n    as well as other sections of that code declarative of the common law\n   </em>\n   , to insulate the matters therein expressed from further judicial development; rather it was the intention of the Legislature to announce and formulate existing common law principles and definitions for purposes of orderly and concise presentation and with a distinct view toward continuing judicial evolution.\" ( 13 Cal.3d at p. 814,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=119%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20858\">\n    119 Cal.Rptr. 858\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=532%20P.2d%201226\">\n    532 P.2d 1226\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , italics added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Civil Code section 1559 - setting forth California's third party beneficiary doctrine - is one of the \"other sections\" of the original 1872 Civil Code referred to in\n   <em>\n    Li\n   </em>\n   that was declarative of the common law and was not intended \"to insulate the matters therein expressed from further judicial development.\" (\n   <em>\n    Li\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 13 Cal.3d at p. 814,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=119%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20858\">\n    119 Cal.Rptr. 858\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=532%20P.2d%201226\">\n    532 P.2d 1226\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) California decisions, applying the third party beneficiary doctrine in a variety of circumstances since 1872, have understood section 1559 in just this fashion, and have not viewed the provision as restricting California's third party beneficiary doctrine to the common law rule as it existed in 1872.

Accordingly, we must determine whether, under the circumstances at issue here, plaintiff is entitled to bring an action against ADP for its alleged breach of its contract with Altour under the common law third party beneficiary doctrine as reflected in the current governing California decisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   From the beginning of the twentieth century, virtually all American courts applying common law contract principles have recognized that it is appropriate\n   <em>\n    under some circumstances\n   </em>\n   to permit an individual or entity that is not a party to a contract to bring an action to enforce the contract. (See, e.g., Eisenberg,\n   <em>\n    Third-Party Beneficiaries\n   </em>\n   (1992)\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=92%20Colum.%20L.%20Rev.%201358\">\n    92 Colum. L.Rev. 1358\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1371-1374 (\n   <em>\n    Eisenberg\n   </em>\n   ).) Courts have struggled, however, to formulate useful, general principles to identify those circumstances in which a third party should be permitted to maintain an action for an alleged breach of a contract to which it is not a contracting party, as distinguished from the usual instance in which only the contracting parties may bring an action under the contract. (See, e.g., Crawford,\n   <em>\n    Chief Justice Wright and the Third Party Beneficiary Problem\n   </em>\n   (1977)\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=4%20Hastings%20Const.%20L.Q.%20769\">\n    4 Hastings Const. L.Q. 769\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 771-772 [\"Few areas of contract law have consistently raised more thorny theoretical and practical difficulties for lawyers, judges, and scholars than the rights of nonparties to enforce contractual promises\"].)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   In the first Restatement of Contracts, published in 1932, the drafters divided the cases that had found that third parties were entitled to enforce a contract into two categories: one involving so-called \"creditor beneficiaries\" and the other involving so-called \"donee beneficiaries.\" (See Rest. Contracts, \u00a7 133 (Restatement First).)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   When the Restatement\n   Second of Contracts (Restatement Second) was adopted in 1979, the drafters concluded that \"the terms 'donee' beneficiary and 'creditor' beneficiary carry overtones of obsolete doctrinal difficulties\" (Rest.2d Contracts, ch. 14, Introductory Note, p. 439) and avoided those\n   terms. Instead, under the Restatement Second, a third party beneficiary who is entitled to enforce a contract entered into between other parties is designated an \"intended beneficiary.\" ( Rest.2d Contracts, \u00a7 302(1).) Although the Restatement Second retained traces of the creditor-beneficiary and donee-beneficiary categories (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 302(1)(a), (1)(b) ), it refocused the principal inquiry regarding whether a third party beneficiary should be considered an intended beneficiary on the question whether \"recognition of a right to performance in the beneficiary is appropriate to effectuate the intention of the [contracting] parties.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 302(1).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Although our past decisions have at times referred to and invoked the creditor-beneficiary and donee-beneficiary labels (see, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Socoma Companies\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 11 Cal.3d at pp. 400-401,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=113%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20585\">\n    113 Cal.Rptr. 585\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=521%20P.2d%20841\">\n    521 P.2d 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ), this court has not relied primarily on those categories or the Restatement formulations in the numerous cases in which we have discussed and applied the third party beneficiary doctrine.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Instead, a review of this court's third party beneficiary decisions\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   reveals that our\n   court has carefully examined\n   the express provisions of the contract at issue, as well as all of the relevant circumstances under which the contract was agreed to, in order to determine not only (1) whether the third party would in fact benefit from the contract, but also (2) whether a motivating purpose of the contracting parties was to provide a benefit to the third party, and (3) whether permitting a third party to bring its own breach of contract action against a contracting party is consistent with the objectives of the contract and the reasonable expectations of the contracting parties. All three elements must be satisfied to permit the third party action to go forward.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   With regard to the second element, we note that our past cases have sometimes referred to this element of the third party beneficiary doctrine as a requirement that the \"purpose\" of the contract be to benefit the third party (see, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Lucas v. Hamm\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 56 Cal.2d at pp. 589-590,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20821\">\n    15 Cal.Rptr. 821\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=364%20P.2d%20685\">\n    364 P.2d 685\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ) and sometimes as a requirement that there be \"an intent to benefit\" the third party (see, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 591,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20821\">\n    15 Cal.Rptr. 821\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=364%20P.2d%20685\">\n    364 P.2d 685\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Murphy v.

Because of the ambiguous and potentially confusing nature of the term \"intent\" (see\n   <em>\n    Eisenberg\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 92 Colum. L.Rev. at p. 1378 ), this opinion uses the term \"motivating purpose\" in its iteration of this element to clarify that the contracting parties must have a motivating purpose to benefit the third party, and not simply knowledge that a benefit to the third party may follow from the contract. To avoid any possible confusion, however, we emphasize that our intent-to-benefit caselaw remains pertinent in applying this element of the third party beneficiary doctrine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   With regard to the third element, we observe that academic commentators have pointed out that the parties to a contract are typically focused on the terms of performance of the contract rather than on the remedies that will be available in the event of a failure of performance (see, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Eisenberg\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 92 Colum. L.Rev. at p. 1388 ), and that our cases have not required a showing that the contracting parties actually considered the third party enforcement question as a prerequisite to the applicability of the third party beneficiary\n   doctrine. (See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Lucas v. Hamm\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 56 Cal.2d at pp. 589-591,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20821\">\n    15 Cal.Rptr. 821\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=364%20P.2d%20685\">\n    364 P.2d 685\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Hartman Ranch\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 10 Cal.2d at pp. 244-246,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=73%20P.2d%201163\">\n    73 P.2d 1163\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) Accordingly, the third element does not focus upon whether the parties specifically intended third party enforcement but rather upon whether, taking into account the language of the contract and all of the relevant circumstances under which the contract was entered into, permitting the third party to bring the proposed breach of contract action would be \"consistent with the objectives of the contract and the reasonable expectations of the contracting parties.\"\n   (\n   <em>\n    Ante\n   </em>\n   , 243 Cal.Rptr.3d at p. 310, 434 P.3d at p. 133.) In other words, this element calls for a judgment regarding the potential effect that permitting third party enforcement would have on the parties' contracting goals, rather than a determination whether the parties actually anticipated third party enforcement at the time the contract was entered into.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Furthermore, the requirement in the third element that third party enforcement be consistent with \"the objectives of the contract\" is comparable to the inquiry, proposed in Professor Eisenberg's article, regarding whether third party enforcement will effectuate \" 'the contracting parties' performance objectives,' \" namely \"those objectives of the\n   <em>\n    enterprise\n   </em>\n   embodied in the contract, read in the light of surrounding circumstances ....\" (\n   <em>\n    Eisenberg\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 92 Colum. L.Rev. at p. 1385, original emphasis; see also Rest.2d Contracts, \u00a7 302(1) [\"a beneficiary of a promise is an intended beneficiary if recognition of a right to performance in the beneficiary is appropriate to effectuate the intention of the parties\"].) And the additional requirement in this element that third party enforcement be consistent as well with \"the reasonable expectations of the contracting parties\" reflects the teaching of prior California decisions that have denied application of the third party beneficiary doctrine when permitting the third party to maintain a breach of contract action would not be consistent with the reasonable\n   expectations of the contracting parties.

The 6AC simply alleges, on information and belief, that Altour and ADP entered into an unwritten contract under which ADP agreed to perform payroll tasks for Altour for the benefit of both Altour and its employees. Because of the present procedural posture of the case - an appeal of a\n   dismissal of the action against ADP after the trial court sustained ADP's demurrer to the 5AC without leave to amend - we must assume the properly pleaded facts contained in the 6AC are true. (See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Garton v. Title Ins. &amp; Trust Co.\n   </em>\n   (1980)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1973275\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-3d/106/365/#p375\">\n    106 Cal.App.3d 365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 375,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=165%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20449\">\n    165 Cal.Rptr. 449\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) The 6AC does not claim, however, that plaintiff was privy to the unwritten contract allegedly entered into between Altour and ADP, and the general allegation in the 6AC that the contract was for the benefit of Altour's employees as well as Altour leaves unclear\n   in what sense the contract was intended to benefit the Altour employees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   In its opinion, the Court of Appeal referred to allegations in the 6AC relating to statements on ADP's website indicating that ADP's data processing system would make it possible for employees easily to obtain information regarding their work hour history, vacation benefits, and other employment related data. If this is the benefit that the parties to the contract allegedly intended to afford Altour's employees, the 6AC does not assert that plaintiff was denied such a benefit, and plaintiff's alleged failure to receive the wages she was due is unrelated to this promised benefit. Accordingly, although the Court of Appeal accurately observed that a third party's rights under the third party beneficiary doctrine may arise under an oral as well as a written contract (see, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Del E. Webb Corp. v. Structural Materials Co.\n   </em>\n   (1981)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2067937\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-3d/123/593/#p606\">\n    123 Cal.App.3d 593\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 606,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=176%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20824\">\n    176 Cal.Rptr. 824\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Lawrence v. Fox\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 20 N.Y. at p. 275 ), here the 6AC's allegations concerning the alleged benefit that the unwritten contract between Altour and ADP allegedly conferred upon Altour's employees are too vague and conclusory to support the proposition that the parties to the Altour/ADP contract expressly or impliedly authorized Altour's employees to maintain a breach of contract action for unpaid wages against ADP.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The Court of Appeal, in concluding that plaintiff may maintain a breach of contract action against ADP on a third party beneficiary theory, relied instead on the allegations that, under ADP's contract with Altour, ADP agreed to \"take over\" all of Altour's ordinary payroll tasks, including calculating the wages Altour is obligated to pay each employee under the governing labor statutes and wage orders and issuing paychecks and pay stubs that reflect the correct wages. (\n   <em>\n    Goonewardene\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 5 Cal.App.5th at p. 173,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=209%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20722\">\n    209 Cal.Rptr.3d 722\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) The Court of Appeal stated that ADP's obligations in this regard rendered each employee of Altour\n   <em>\n    a creditor beneficiary\n   </em>\n   of the Altour/ADP contract, on the theory that ADP's role under the contract was \"to discharge\" Altour's wage obligations to its employees. (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=209%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20722\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   We conclude that the Court of Appeal erred in characterizing plaintiff as a creditor beneficiary of the Altour/ADP contract and permitting the breach of contract action to go forward on this theory under the third party beneficiary\n   doctrine. Unlike past creditor beneficiary cases, in which one party to the contract (the promisor) agreed to pay a sum of money to a third party to discharge a preexisting debt of the other party to the contract (the promisee) (see, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Lawrence v. Fox\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2022913\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny/20/268/\">\n    20 N.Y. 268\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; accord\n   <em>\n    Calhoun v.

Instead, as in most employer/payroll company agreements,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   it appears\n   that ADP,\n   under its contract with Altour, simply agreed to assist Altour by calculating the amount of wages that Altour owes to each employee in light of the applicable labor statutes and wage order and providing the ministerial services of making out paychecks and delivering the required pay information to each employee. In the absence of an allegation to the contrary, we must reasonably infer that the employees' wages were paid by funds provided by their employer, Altour, rather than ADP. A payroll company's provision of the type of assistance relied upon by the Court of Appeal is quite distinct from agreeing to \"discharge\" the obligations that Altour owes to its employees under the applicable labor statutes and wage orders, as that term has been used in prior third party beneficiary decisions. (Cf. Rest.2d, Contracts, \u00a7 302(1)(a) &amp; com. b, pp. 439-440.) For this reason, we conclude that plaintiff is not properly viewed as a creditor beneficiary of the Altour/ADP contract within the meaning of the third party beneficiary doctrine.\n   We turn to the question whether plaintiff may bring its breach of contract action under the three elements of California's third party beneficiary doctrine that we have discussed above. (\n   <em>\n    Ante\n   </em>\n   , 243 Cal.Rptr.3d at pp. 309-310, 434 P.3d at pp. 132-133.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Even if we assume, without deciding, that an employer's hiring of an independent payroll company will in fact generally benefit employees with regard to the wages they receive,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   as we have explained the fact that the employees will generally obtain a benefit from the contract is not sufficient in itself to authorize the employees to sue the payroll company under California's third party beneficiary doctrine. In addition, a motivating purpose of the contracting parties must be to provide such a benefit to employees. (See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Garcia v. Truck Ins.

Instead, the relevant motivating purpose is to provide a benefit\n   <em>\n    to the employer\n   </em>\n   , with regard to the cost and efficiency of the tasks performed and the avoidance of potential penalties. Although the employer intends that the payroll company will accurately calculate the wages owed to its employees under the applicable labor statutes and wage orders, in situations in which it may be unclear or debatable as to how the applicable rules should be interpreted or applied, the employer would reasonably expect the payroll company to proceed with the employer's interest in mind. In short, the relevant motivating purpose of the contract is simply to assist the employer in the performance of its required tasks, not to provide a benefit to its employees with regard to the amount of wages they receive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Moreover, even if a motivating purpose of such a contract were to provide a benefit to employees with regard to wages they receive, it still would not\n   follow that the employees would be entitled to sue the payroll company for breach of contract under the third party beneficiary doctrine. As this court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Socoma Companies\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 11 Cal.3d at pages 401-402,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=113%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20585\">\n    113 Cal.Rptr. 585\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=521%20P.2d%20841\">\n    521 P.2d 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , teaches, even if a motivating purpose of the contracting parties is to provide a benefit to the employees, it still may be inconsistent with the objectives of the contract and the reasonable expectations of the contracting parties to permit the employees to sue the payroll company for an alleged breach of the contract. (See Geis,\n   <em>\n    Broadcast Contracting\n   </em>\n   (2012)\n   <extracted-citation index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=106%20Nw.%20U.%20L.%20Rev.%201153\">\n    106 Nw.U.

Hamm\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4379275\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-2d/56/583/#p590\">\n    56 Cal.2d 583\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20821\">\n    15 Cal.Rptr. 821\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=364%20P.2d%20685\">\n    364 P.2d 685\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , there is no need to permit a third party employee to bring suit to enforce an alleged breach by ADP of its obligations under the contract, because Altour is available and is fully capable of pursuing a breach of contract action against ADP if, by failing to comply with its contractual responsibilities, ADP renders Altour liable for any violation of the applicable wage orders or labor statutes. Simply put, permitting an employee to sue ADP for an alleged breach of its contractual obligations to Altour is not necessary to effectuate the objectives of the contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Further, if a typical contract between an employer and a payroll company were interpreted to authorize each of the employer's employees to sue the payroll company for any alleged wage violation, such an interpretation would clearly impose substantial additional costs on the payroll company in light of the significant legal expense that would be entailed in defending the numerous wage and hour disputes that regularly arise between employees and employers. As a result, such an interpretation would likely lead a payroll company to pass these additional litigation costs on to the employer through a higher price for its payroll services, an increased cost that an employer would typically prefer to avoid. Thus, permitting employees to sue a payroll company for alleged wage violations would ordinarily be\n   inconsistent with the reasonable expectations of the employer as well as the payroll company and also unnecessary because employees retain the right to obtain full recovery for unpaid wages from their employer. Accordingly, we conclude that a contract between an employer and a payroll company should not be understood to permit the employer's employees to sue the payroll company for an alleged breach of its obligations under its contract with the employer.

As we explain, however, we conclude that a variety of policy considerations weigh against the imposition upon a payroll company of a tort duty of care to employees in this context.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   First and perhaps most significantly, plaintiff's argument ignores the fundamental point that whenever a payroll company's negligence in calculating an employee's wages results in a violation of the applicable labor statutes or wage orders, California law already provides the employee\n   with a full and complete remedy for any wage loss the employee sustains as a result of the payroll company's negligent conduct. An employee's interest in this regard is fully protected by the employee's well-established right under the labor statutes to recover in a civil action against the employer the full wages and other significant remedies (including attorney fees and potential civil penalties) that are authorized under those statutes. (See, e.g., Lab. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1194, 1197.1, 2699 ;\n   <em>\n    Martinez v. Combs\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3905026\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-4th/49/35/#p49\">\n    49 Cal.4th 35\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=109%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20514\">\n    109 Cal.Rptr.3d 514\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=231%20P.3d%20259\">\n    231 P.3d 259\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) Given the employer's clear and direct liability for any wage loss caused by the payroll company's negligence in calculating the wages that are due, the imposition of a separate tort duty of care on a payroll company is generally unnecessary to adequately protect the employee's interests. (Cf.\n   <em>\n    Cedars-Sinai Med. Center v. Superior Court\n   </em>\n   (1998)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"344179\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-4th/18/1/#p11\">\n    18 Cal.4th 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 11-13,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=74%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20248\">\n    74 Cal.Rptr.2d 248\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=954%20P.2d%20511\">\n    954 P.2d 511\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [concluding recognition of tort action for spoliation of evidence is unwarranted in part because of the availability of adequate alternative remedies].)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Second, imposing tort liability upon the payroll company is not needed as a means of deterring negligent conduct on the part of the payroll company. Under its contract with the employer, the payroll company is already obligated to act with due care in ensuring that the employer fulfills its obligations to its employees under the labor statutes and wage orders. The payroll company presumably will be liable to the employer if the payroll company's negligence in failing to comply with the applicable labor statutes or wage orders results in the employer being held liable in a suit brought by an employee against the employer. Imposing on a payroll company a tort duty to the employee will not appreciably increase the payroll company's incentive to avoid negligent conduct with respect to its compliance with the applicable labor statutes and wage orders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Third, unlike other situations in which a tort duty of care to third parties has been imposed (see, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Heyer v. Flaig\n   </em>\n   (1969)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2308184\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-2d/70/223/#p228\">\n    70 Cal.2d 223\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 228-229,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=74%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20225\">\n    74 Cal.Rptr. 225\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=449%20P.2d%20161\">\n    449 P.2d 161\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ), the payroll company has no special relationship with the employer's employees that would warrant recognition of such a duty of care. (Accord\n   <em>\n    Goodman v. Kennedy\n   </em>\n   (1976)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2286335\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-3d/18/335/#p343\">\n    18 Cal.3d 335\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 343-344,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=134%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20375\">\n    134 Cal.Rptr. 375\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=556%20P.2d%20737\">\n    556 P.2d 737\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) As we have already determined, under California's third party beneficiary doctrine plaintiff is not entitled to maintain\n   even a breach of contract action against defendant payroll company. (\n   <em>\n    Ante\n   </em>\n   , 243 Cal.Rptr.3d at pp. 307-316, 434 P.3d at pp. 130-138.) Given this conclusion, it would clearly be anomalous to impose tort liability, with its increased potential damages (see, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Erlich v. Menezes\n   </em>\n   (1999)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"884885\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-4th/21/543/#p550\">\n    21 Cal.4th 543\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 550-551,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=87%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20886\">\n    87 Cal.Rptr.2d 886\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=981%20P.2d%20978\">\n    981 P.2d 978\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ), upon the payroll company based upon its alleged failure to perform its obligations under its contract with plaintiff's employer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Fourth, the imposition on a payroll company of a duty of care to an employee may improperly distort the payroll company's performance of its contractual obligations to the employer in at least some circumstances. As already noted (\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   , 243 Cal.Rptr.3d at pp. 314-315, 434 P.3d at pp. 136-137), in the wage and hour context, the respective interests of an employer and an employee regarding the proper interpretation and application of the applicable labor statutes and wage orders are at times in conflict. When the meaning or scope of a labor statute or wage order is ambiguous or uncertain, imposing on the payroll company a tort duty of care to an employee may adversely affect the payroll company's fulfillment of its contractual obligations to the employer. This risk is particularly substantial because, as noted, the type of damages that are generally available in a tort action include items that are\n   unavailable in a contract action, and, in instances in which the meaning of a provision of a labor statute or wage order is uncertain, the potential of greater liability may induce the payroll company to place the employee's interests above those of the employer with whom the payroll company has directly contracted.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Fifth and finally, imposition of a tort duty of care on a payroll company is likely to add an unnecessary and potentially burdensome complication to California's increasing volume of wage and hour litigation. Because an employee who fails to receive what he or she believes is the proper amount of wages due under the applicable labor statutes and wage orders will generally have no way of knowing whether the underpayment is due to the actions of the employer, the payroll company, or both the employer and the payroll company, the payroll company is likely to be joined as an additional party in virtually every wage and hour lawsuit, rendering such litigation more complicated and more difficult to settle. Inasmuch as an employee can obtain a full recovery for his or her economic loss in a wage and hour action against the employer alone, the substantial burden to the judicial system that would result from the addition of a tort action against the payroll company is likely to outweigh any potential benefit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Considering the \" 'sum total' \" of the relevant considerations of policy (\n   <em>\n    Dillon v. Legg\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 68 Cal.2d at p. 734,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=69%20Cal.%20Rptr.%2072\">\n    69 Cal.Rptr. 72\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=441%20P.2d%20912\">\n    441 P.2d 912\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ), we conclude that it is not appropriate to impose upon a payroll company a tort duty of care to an employee with respect to the obligations imposed by the applicable labor statutes and wage orders. Accordingly, we conclude that the Court of Appeal erred in determining that plaintiff's negligence cause of action could go forward.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Negligent Misrepresentation Cause of Action\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   In addition to upholding plaintiff's negligence cause of action, the Court of\n   Appeal held that the allegations of the 6AC are adequate to support plaintiff's proposed cause of action for negligent misrepresentation. We conclude that the Court of Appeal erred in this respect as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The numerous policy considerations that we have discussed above in concluding that it is not appropriate to impose on ADP a duty of care to support plaintiff's negligence cause of action are applicable as well to plaintiff's cause of action against ADP for negligent misrepresentation. Insofar as ADP's conduct in issuing to plaintiff inaccurate paychecks and pay stubs would otherwise support an action for negligent misrepresentation, any economic loss suffered by plaintiff can be remedied in a statutory wage and hour cause of action against her employer, and recognition of a negligent misrepresentation cause of action against ADP is not needed to deter the alleged negligent conduct on the part of ADP because ADP already has a comparable incentive by virtue of its potential contractual liability to plaintiff's employer that would result from such negligence. Further, permitting\n   plaintiff to pursue a negligent misrepresentation cause of action against ADP in this context would have the same potential distorting effect on ADP's performance of its contractual obligations to plaintiff's employer and would introduce an unnecessary and burdensome complication in virtually all wage and hour litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   To our knowledge, the only case that has indicated that a negligent misrepresentation cause of action may be permissible even though a negligence cause of action has been rejected because the relevant policy considerations weigh against the recognition of a duty of care is\n   <em>\n    Bily\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2008192\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-4th/3/370/#p397\">\n    3 Cal.4th 370\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%2051\">\n    11 Cal.Rptr.2d 51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=834%20P.2d%20745\">\n    834 P.2d 745\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Bily\n   </em>\n   , the court concluded, based upon a number of policy considerations, that \"an auditor's liability for general negligence in the conduct of an audit of its client['s] financial statements is confined to the client, i.e., the person who contracts for or engages the audit services\" and that the auditor owes no duty of care to third parties who may have relied on the audit report and thus such third parties may not maintain a negligence action against the auditor. ( 3 Cal.4th at p. 406,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%2051\">\n    11 Cal.Rptr.2d 51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=834%20P.2d%20745\">\n    834 P.2d 745\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .)

As our discussion of plaintiff's third party beneficiary claim explains, ADP's contract with Altour was\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   entered into for the benefit of plaintiff or Altour's other employees and plaintiff was\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   an intended beneficiary of ADP's services.

(See, e.g., Lab. Code, \u00a7 1194.) Although it is possible that a specialized payroll company may do a better job than a small company in complying with the applicable legal requirements, if the payroll company makes the employer aware of applicable exceptions, restrictions or other legal rules that were not known to the employer and that operate to reduce the employer's wage obligations to its employees, the hiring of the payroll company may not in fact benefit employees with regard to the wages they receive.
