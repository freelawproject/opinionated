FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Atkins was charged by information with attempting to deter an executive officer and resisting an executive officer ( \u00a7 69 ; count 1); misdemeanor possession of a weapon on school grounds (\u00a7 626.10, subd. (b) (hereafter section 626.10(b) ); count 2); and misdemeanor resisting, obstructing, or delaying a peace officer (\u00a7 148, subd. (a) (hereafter section 148(a) ); count 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In count 1, the information charged that \"On or about [March 10, 2017], in the above named Judicial District, the crime of Resisting [an] Executive Officer, in violation of Penal Code Section 69, a Felony, was committed by Randall Patrick Atkins, who did unlawfully attempt by means of threats and violence to deter and prevent Officer Jack Calhoun, who was then and there an executive officer, from performing a duty imposed upon such officer by law, and did knowingly resist by the use of force and violence said executive officer in the performance of his/her duty.\" (Some capitalization omitted.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Nathaniel Calhoun, the officer named in Count 1,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   testified at trial that, on March 10, 2017, he was a police officer with the Police Department of the University of California, Santa Cruz (UC Santa Cruz). Calhoun was working the night shift as a patrol officer. He was wearing a police uniform with a badge and belt and was driving a \"fully marked Ford Crown Victoria police cruiser.\" The car was a \"typical patrol car,\" that said \"UC Santa Cruz Police\n   Department\" on it and had blue and red lights on top.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Just before 1:00 a.m. on March 10, Officer Calhoun was patrolling in his car in a parking structure located on the UC Santa Cruz campus. The parking structure was five or six stories tall, very well-lit, and had a spiral roadway inside it. When he was on the second story of the parking structure, Calhoun\n   \"saw two skateboarders traveling towards [him] at a high rate of speed\" down the parking structure roadway. The skateboarders narrowly missed crashing into his patrol car. One of the skateboarders jumped off his skateboard; the other continued down the ramp and \"vanished from sight.\" Skateboarding is prohibited on the campus of UC Santa Cruz.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Calhoun detained the man who had jumped off his skateboard and placed the skateboard on the hood of Calhoun's patrol car. The man who had skateboarded away, later identified as Atkins, came back yelling that Calhoun had tried to hit the men with his patrol car. Atkins took the skateboard off Calhoun's car, started walking away, and \"said something to the effect that [UC Santa Cruz] were rent-a-cops and he didn't need to listen to [them].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Officer Calhoun told Atkins to stop, but Atkins ignored Calhoun's command and continued to walk away. Calhoun grabbed Atkins's arm, but Atkins jerked his body away and broke free from Calhoun's grip. The other man and Atkins ran out of the parking garage and got into Atkins's truck, which was parked in a parking stall. Calhoun ran to the truck and stood behind it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The engine of the truck went on. Atkins, who was in the driver's seat, rolled down his window and yelled that \"he did nothing wrong, [and] would be forced to run [Calhoun] over if [he] didn't get out of his way of his car.\" Officer Calhoun perceived Atkins's statement as a \"credible threat\" that Atkins \"would run [him] over if [he] didn't get out of his way.\" Fearing for his safety, Calhoun moved away, and Atkins drove away in the truck. Based on the truck's direction of travel, if Calhoun had not moved away, the truck would have hit him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Officer Calhoun got back into his car and followed the truck. Another UC Santa Cruz officer, Officer Flippo, arrived and stopped the truck. Calhoun approached Atkins, who was still inside the truck, and grabbed Atkins's left arm. Atkins told Calhoun that he \"had no right to search his vehicle and that we were rent-a-cops and we couldn't do anything to him.\" Calhoun told Atkins \"multiple times\" that he was a police officer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Officer Flippo told Atkins that he was under arrest for \"obstructing an officer.\" Atkins, who was agitated and uncooperative, was still sitting in the driver's seat of his truck. Flippo and Calhoun pulled Atkins out of the truck. Atkins lunged back toward the truck. Calhoun and Flippo \"went hands-on and forced him to the ground.\" Atkins was physically resisting Calhoun and Flippo by tensing and bracing his arms and \"refusing to put his hands behind his back.\" Calhoun and Flippo ordered Atkins to put his hand behind his back and to stop resisting. Another officer arrived, and they were able to handcuff Atkins. While handcuffed, Atkins was \"flailing\" his body, and Flippo had to put a \"control hold\" on him so that Calhoun could search him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Officer Gregory Daniel Flippo testified that, on March 10, 2017, he was working as a sergeant with the UC Santa Cruz Police Department. He was on patrol and in uniform. Flippo was dispatched to assist Calhoun. When Flippo saw Atkins driving the truck, Flippo activated the emergency lights on his patrol car, pulled into the oncoming lane of traffic, and \"essentially\n   forced [the truck] to stop in front of [him].\" Flippo got out of his car, drew his gun, and yelled at the occupants of the truck to raise their hands. Atkins was very upset and was \"basically challenging our authority to stop him saying, you know, you have no legal authority to stop me, I do not recognize your authority. You guys aren't even police officers.\" Flippo described how Atkins physically resisted Flippo's attempts to handcuff and search him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Ravinder Bal testified that, on March 10, 2017, she was working as a police officer with the UC Santa Cruz Police Department. She arrived on the scene to help Officer Calhoun and Sergeant Flippo arrest Atkins. She heard Atkins \"yelling that it was an unauthorized stop, that we had no right to contact him, that everything was just illegal contact and that he knew his rights.\" Bal observed the physical struggle between Flippo and Atkins.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Atkins testified that he first saw Officer Calhoun when Atkins was skateboarding down the parking structure at approximately 20 miles per hour. Atkins thought Calhoun endangered his life by blocking the skateboarders' path of travel with his car when they were \"hauling balls.\" Atkins told the jury, \"there's no brakes on a skateboard, that's common knowledge.\" Atkins saw Calhoun's car but thought it was a \"security car\" and not a police car. Atkins acknowledged that the car was black and white but stated \"security forces, cop cars, sheriff's units, they all have Crown Victoria[s].\" Calhoun's car did not have any markings on it other than \"[o]ne tiny yellow star on the side.\" Atkins believed that \"skateboarding is not a crime.\" Atkins was \"in full-on panic mode.\" Atkins had never seen any of the three officers before that evening.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Atkins acknowledged that he told Calhoun he would run him over with his truck, but \"I didn't believe he was a cop, he was endangering my life.\" Atkins did not run Calhoun over, and Atkins did not intend to or want to run Calhoun over.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Atkins stated that Calhoun had pointed a taser at him, but \"I thought he was a security guard. Security guards, they own guns, tasers, night sticks, all that and then some.\" Atkins agreed that Calhoun was dressed in a police uniform, but \"[s]o are security guards at shopping malls.\" Atkins saw a \"tin badge,\" but you can \"buy some badges at the Dollar Tree.\" Atkins also did not believe that Calhoun was a police officer because Calhoun was by himself and \"cops come in multiples.\" Calhoun identified himself to Atkins as a\n   police officer, but Atkins told the jury, \"[a]nybody can say I am the police.\" Referring to Calhoun, Atkins stated, \"I didn't know he was an officer.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The trial court gave the jury several instructions relevant to the section 69 charge. Neither counsel objected to the final wording of any of the instructions. The prosecution argued that the jury could find Atkins guilty of section 69 both because Atkins tried to prevent Officer Calhoun from performing a duty (by threatening to run Calhoun over with his truck while Calhoun was trying to detain him) and because Atkins physically resisted Calhoun (by pulling away from him multiple times while Calhoun was trying to arrest him). The trial court gave separate instructions on each theory. (CALCRIM Nos. 2651 and 2652.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The trial court instructed, \"The People have proceeded on two theories to establish a violation of Penal Code section 69 as charged in Count 1. Under [o]ne theory, the People have sought to prove that the defendant tried to prevent or deter an executive officer from performing that officer's duty.\" The trial court instructed the jury that, \"under this theory, the People\n   must prove that: [\u00b6] 1. The defendant willfully and unlawfully used violence or a threat of violence to try to prevent or deter an executive officer from performing the officer's lawful duty; and [\u00b6] 2. When the defendant acted, he intended to prevent or deter the executive Officer Jack Calhoun from performing the officer's lawful duty\" (some capitalization omitted). Among other definitions, the instruction stated that \"[s]omeone commits an act willfully when he or she does it willingly or on purpose\"; \"[a] peace officer is an executive officer\"; and \"[a] sworn member of [the] University of California Police Department is a peace officer\" (some italics omitted). The instruction also stated, \"[t]he executive [o]fficer does not need to be performing his job duties at the time the threat is communicated.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   For the second theory, that Atkins \"resisted an executive officer in the performance of that officer's duty,\" the trial court instructed the jury that the People must prove that \"[t]he defendant used force or violence to resist an executive officer\"; \"[w]hen the defendant acted, the officer was performing his lawful duty\"; and \"[w]hen the defendant acted, he knew the executive officer was performing his duty.\" This instruction also stated that \"[a] peace officer is an executive officer,\" and \"[a] sworn member of [the] University of California Police Department is a peace officer\" (some italics omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The verdict form for count 1 stated, \"We the jury in the above-entitled case find the defendant, Randall Patrick Atkins, [guilty/not guilty] of resisting an executive officer, as charged in Count 1.\" Neither party objected to the verdict form for count 1 or stated that the verdict form should also include\n   language relating to the \"first theory\" of section 69-namely that Atkins had tried to prevent or deter an executive officer from performing his duty.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In his closing argument, the prosecutor stated with respect to the \"second theory\" of section 69-using violence or force to resist an executive officer-\"the defendant has to know that the executive officer is performing their duty.\" He added, \"And, of course, he does because, again, at some point the notion that you didn't know that these guys were real police officers just isn't reasonable at all.\" Defense counsel argued that \"Mr. Atkins did not believe Officer Calhoun was an officer. The car itself was a black and white car with a small star. He didn't see police on the back, because, again, Officer Calhoun was facing him. And a lot of the security details now, they do have those type of cars. And we always hear evidence or on the news of someone trying to impersonate an officer.\" In rebuttal, the prosecutor argued that the \"first theory\" of section 69 did not require proof that Atkins knew that Calhoun was an officer. The prosecutor stated, \"You don't have to know that they're an officer to alleviate or unburden yourself of your obligation to follow directives. It's not a defense, otherwise there would be an additional element [that] the defendant knew that Officer Calhoun was a police officer. It's not there.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   During deliberations, the jury submitted a written question relating to (in the words of the jury) \"Theory One\" of section 69. The note stated, \"Does intent require that the defendant believed Calhoun was an executive police officer?\" The trial court read the question to counsel and stated, \"And I'm going to answer that, no, there's\n   no requirement that he believed Calhoun was an executive officer.\" Neither counsel objected to the trial court's proposed answer to the jury question. The trial court submitted to the jury a written answer that stated, \"There is no requirement that [t]he Defendant believed Calhoun was an Executive Police Officer.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The jury found Atkins guilty of sections 69 and 148(a), as charged in counts 1 and 3, but not guilty of section 626.10(b), as charged in count 2. At sentencing, the trial court suspended imposition of sentence, placed Atkins on formal probation for a period of eighteen months, and ordered him to serve 60 days in the county jail and to stay away from the campus of UC Santa Cruz. The trial court also imposed a number of other conditions of probation and assessed fines and fees. Atkins timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    II. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Atkins argues that the trial court failed in its duty to correctly instruct the jury on the \"first theory\" of section 69-the use of a threat of violence or violence to deter an executive officer from performing his duty-when the trial court did not inform the jury that Atkins \"was required to know, or reasonably should have known, that Calhoun was an executive officer.\" Atkins contends that the jury instruction for this theory omitted this element of the crime, and the omission was material and not harmless. Atkins similarly argues that the trial court erred when it answered the jury's question by instructing, \"[t]here is no requirement that [t]he Defendant believed Calhoun was an Executive Police Officer,\" and the error was prejudicial. Atkins further maintains that his trial counsel was constitutionally ineffective when he failed to object to the trial court's erroneous answer to the jury's question. Atkins argues that reversal of his conviction of section 69 is required to remedy the trial court's instructional errors and his trial counsel's ineffective assistance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The Attorney General counters that the first theory of section 69 does not require that the perpetrator of the crime know that the person they are attempting to deter is an executive officer. In the Attorney General's view, the language of the jury instruction was correct because it tracked the language of the statute, and Atkins waived any challenge to it by failing to object to the wording of the instruction. Further, even if the trial court committed instructional error in the instruction or in its answer to the jury question, that error was harmless because there was ample evidence that Atkins had violated the \"second theory\" of section 69 by resisting arrest by force or violence. In addition, Atkins's trial testimony was \"conflicting\" and implausible and \"no reasonable juror would have believed [Atkins's] assertions.\" For the same reasons, any claim that Atkins's trial counsel was constitutionally ineffective fails because there was no legal basis to object to the instructions, and Atkins cannot demonstrate prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Resolving these competing views requires us to decide whether the first theory of section 69 requires that the perpetrator know that the person he or she is attempting to deter is an executive officer-a question of statutory interpretation that we review de novo.

By its text, the second way of violating the statute requires that the prosecution prove that defendant \"knowingly resist[ed]\" the officer by \"force or violence.\" (\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   ) This \"resistance prong\" of section 69 is a general intent crime that requires \"only a knowledge that the facts exist which bring the act or omission within the provisions of this code.\" (\n   <em>\n    People v.
