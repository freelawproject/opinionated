INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-6\">\n   In 2016, voters approved Proposition 57, which added a provision to the California Constitution that significantly expanded parole consideration to all state prisoners convicted of a nonviolent felony offense. ( Cal. Const., art. 1, \u00a7 32, subd. (a)(1) (section 32 (a)(1).) ) Petitioner Gregory Gadlin, a third-strike offender with two prior convictions that render him a sex-offender registrant, contends the regulations of the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) invalidly exclude him from Proposition 57 relief. We agree and grant the petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   <strong>\n    II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   In 2007, a jury convicted Gadlin of assault with a deadly weapon ( Pen. Code, \u00a7 245, subd. (a)(1) ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The jury sustained allegations of two prior serious felony convictions (\u00a7 667, subd. (a)(1) ). Those priors were: (1) a 1984 conviction for forcible rape (\u00a7 261, former subd. (2) ); and (2) a 1986\n   conviction for forcible child molestation (\u00a7 288, subd. (b) ), each of which is a registrable offense under the Sex Offender Registration Act (\u00a7 290, subd. (c) ). Gadlin was sentenced to 25 years to life pursuant to the Three Strikes law\n   (\u00a7\u00a7 667, subds. (b)-(i), 1170.12), plus an additional 5-year term for each of his prior serious felony convictions, for a total of 35 years to life in state prison. On appeal, this court affirmed the judgment. (\n   <em>\n    People v. Gadlin\n   </em>\n   (May 21, 2009, B203647)\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009%20WL%201415943\">\n    2009 WL 1415943\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [nonpub. opn.].)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   On November 22, 2017, Gadlin filed a habeas corpus petition in the superior court, challenging his exclusion from early parole consideration by CDCR. On March 2, 2018, the superior court denied the petition, concluding that under the then-applicable regulations, Gadlin was not entitled to early parole consideration because he had been sentenced as a third-strike offender.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On May 7, 2018, Gadlin filed a habeas corpus petition in this court. We appointed counsel for Gadlin and directed counsel to file an amended petition addressing the validity of CDCR's regulations. Appointed counsel thereafter filed an amended petition challenging CDCR's regulations. We issued an order to show cause why the relief requested in the petition should not be granted. CDCR filed a return to the order to show cause, arguing that the following two factors render Gadlin ineligible for early parole consideration: (1) his status as an inmate serving an indeterminate Three Strikes sentence with the possibility of parole; and (2) his prior convictions for sex offenses that require him to register as a sex offender.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The CDCR then adopted emergency regulations, effective January 1, 2019, to comply with our holding in\n   <em>\n    In re Edwards\n   </em>\n   (2018)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12514860\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/237/673/#p1192\">\n    26 Cal.App.5th 1181\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1192-1193,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12514860\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/237/673/#p1192\">\n    237 Cal.Rptr.3d 673\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Edwards\n   </em>\n   ). ( Cal. Code Regs., tit. 15, \u00a7 3491, subd. (b)(1), Register 2018, No. 52 (Dec. 26, 2018).) Those modified regulations moot CDCR's argument that Gadlin is ineligible for early parole consideration based on his status as a Three Strikes offender. We thus consider only CDCR's second argument, that Gadlin's two prior convictions for registrable sex offenses render him ineligible for consideration for early release.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

J., Concurring\n   </author>\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    The opinion of the court resolves the appeal before us on narrow grounds, correctly concluding that regulations promulgated by the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) are unconstitutional as applied to bar early parole consideration for petitioner Gregory Gadlin (petitioner) based on two prior sex offenses committed in the 1980s for which petitioner has already been imprisoned and released.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    Almost always, the wise choice is to refrain from saying more than necessary to dispose of an appeal. But under the unusual circumstances here where the parties have briefed the issue in broader terms-effectively, whether the regulatory prohibition of early parole consideration for sex offender registrants is facially consistent with the pertinent provisions of Proposition 57, the Public Safety and Rehabilitation Act of 2016-and where all\n    concerned would benefit from knowing sooner rather than later what regulatory approaches are permissible, I believe there is good reason to say a bit more than strictly necessary. I therefore write separately to outline my view that the regulatory provisions in question are not inconsistent on their face with the provisions added to the constitution by Proposition 57.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-32\">\n    In my view, Proposition 57 authorizes the Secretary of the CDCR to adopt rules that exclude from early parole consideration those inmates who\n    are currently in custody as a result of an offense that would require registration as a sex offender. Succinctly put, I believe the Secretary has that authority because he acts pursuant to an express grant of authority to promulgate regulations to implement an initiative with an undefined term, because a clear textual indication that Proposition 57 was intended to bar regulatory exclusion of current-offense sex offenders is absent (which distinguishes this case from our holding in\n    <em>\n     In re Edwards\n    </em>\n    (2018)\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12514860\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/237/673/#p1192\">\n     26 Cal.App.5th 1181\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12514860\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/237/673/#p1192\">\n     237 Cal.Rptr.3d 673\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (\n    <em>\n     Edwards\n    </em>\n    ) ), and because the ballot materials for Proposition 57-including a ballot argument signed by the then-sitting Governor that addresses whether early parole consideration for nonviolent felony offenses extends to sex offenders-illuminate an ambiguity about the intended scope of the initiative and illustrate why CDCR's regulatory approach cannot be deemed inconsistent with the voters' intent.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    I\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    Two provisions that Proposition 57 added to our state Constitution are important in this appeal. The first is the provision enacted as Article I, section 32, subdivision (a)(1) (hereafter section 32 (a) ). It reads: \"Any person convicted of a nonviolent felony offense and sentenced to state prison shall be eligible for parole consideration after completing the full term for his or her primary offense.\" The second is the provision in the next subdivision: \"The Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation shall adopt regulations in furtherance of these provisions, and the Secretary of the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation shall certify that these regulations protect and enhance public safety.\" ( Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 32, subd. (b) (hereafter section 32 (b).) )\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    In regulations promulgated pursuant to section 32(b), the Secretary adopted the Penal Code's definition of a \"violent felony\" for use in defining what \"nonviolent felony offense\" means as used in section 32 (a). ( Cal. Code Regs., tit. 15, \u00a7\u00a7 3490, subds. (a)-(c) [with additional qualifications not relevant here, an inmate is a nonviolent offender if the inmate is not serving a determinate sentence for a crime listed in the Penal Code's definition of a violent felony], 3495, subds. (a)-(b) [same for indeterminate sentences]; see also Pen. Code, \u00a7 667.5, subd. (c) [defining \"violent felony\"].) As relevant here, the Penal Code definition includes a significant number of sex crimes: specified forms of rape, sodomy, oral copulation, and committing a lewd or lascivious act; sexual penetration by a foreign object; assault with intent to commit specified sex crimes (including rape, sodomy, and oral copulation), continuous sexual abuse of a child, and specified sex crimes committed in concert. ( Pen. Code, \u00a7 667.5, subds. (c)(3)-(6), (11), (15)-(16), (18).) Inmates currently serving a sentence as a result of these sex crimes are ineligible for early parole consideration ( Cal. Code Regs., tit. 15, \u00a7\u00a7 3491, subd. (a), 3496, subd. (a) ) and there is no dispute about that.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    What is disputed by the parties is a further step taken by the CDCR regulations\n    promulgated pursuant to section 32(b), a step that makes offenders who have committed other sex-related offenses ineligible for early parole consideration. Specifically, the regulations bar early parole consideration for any inmates \"convicted of a sexual offense that currently requires or will require registration as a sex offender under the Sex Offender Registration Act, codified in sections 290 through 290.024 of the Penal Code.\" ( Cal. Code Regs., tit. 15, \u00a7\u00a7 3491, subd. (b)(3), 3496, subd. (b).) To understand the significance of this regulatory exclusion, we must compare the crimes that trigger mandatory sex offender registration with those sex offenses defined as violent felonies under Penal Code section 667.5 ; where there is no overlap between the two is where the regulations' sex offender registration exclusion is operative.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    Penal Code section 290 is the principal statutory provision that defines the crimes for which a convicted defendant must register as a sex offender. The statute's list of crimes (as it existed at the time of Proposition 57's passage) is long. It provides: \"Any person who, since July 1, 1944, has been or is hereafter convicted in any court in this state or in any federal or military court of a violation of Section 187 [murder] committed in the perpetration, or an attempt to perpetrate, rape or any act punishable under Section 286 [sodomy], 288 [lewd or lascivious conduct], 288a [oral copulation], or 289 [forcible penetration], Section 207 or 209 [kidnapping] committed with intent to violate Section 261 [rape], 286, 288, 288a, or 289, Section 220 [assault with intent to commit rape, sodomy, or oral copulation], except assault to commit mayhem, subdivision (b) and (c) of Section 236.1 [human trafficking], Section 243.4 [sexual battery], paragraph (1), (2), (3), (4), or (6) of subdivision (a) of Section 261 [rape, except rape by false impersonation of a person known to the victim], paragraph (1) of subdivision (a) of Section 262 [spousal rape] involving the use of force or violence for which the person is sentenced to the state prison, Section 264.1 [rape in concert], 266 [enticement of a minor for prostitution], or 266c [fear-induced sex acts], subdivision (b) of Section 266h [pimping a minor], subdivision (b) of Section 266i [pandering a minor], Section 266j [procuring a minor for lewd and lascivious conduct], 267 [abduction for prostitution], 269 [aggravated child sexual assault], 285 [incest], 286, 288, 288a, 288.3 [contacting a minor to commit a sex offense], 288.4 [arranging a meeting with a minor to engage in lewd or lascivious conduct], 288.5 [continuous sexual abuse of a child], 288.7 [sex or sodomy with a child under ten years old], 289, or 311.1 [sale of child pornography], subdivision (b), (c), or (d) of Section 311.2 [production and distribution of child pornography], Section 311.3 [child sexual exploitation], 311.4 [employing a minor in sale or distribution of child pornography], 311.10 [advertising child pornography], 311.11 [possession of child pornography], or 647.6 [annoying or molesting children], ..., subdivision (c) of Section 653f [solicitation of rape by force or violence, sodomy by force or violence, or\n    oral copulation by force or violence], subdivision 1 or 2 of Section 314 [indecent exposure], any offense involving lewd or lascivious conduct under Section 272 [contributing to the delinquency of a minor], or any felony violation of Section 288.2 [sending \"harmful matter,\" i.e. patently offensive sexual matter, to a minor] ....\" (Former Pen.

Among them are those convicted of human trafficking,\n    sexual penetration accomplished when the victim is prevented from resisting by an intoxicating or anesthetic substance, solicitation of another to commit rape by force or violence, pimping a minor, and various child sexual exploitation offenses.\n    <footnotemark>\n     1\n    </footnotemark>\n    ( Pen.

( Cal. Code Regs., tit. 15, \u00a7\u00a7 3490, subds. (a)-(c), 3495, subds. (a)-(b) ; Ballot Pamp., Gen. Elec. (Nov. 8, 2016) rebuttal to argument against Prop. 57, p. 59 [\"Violent criminals as defined in Penal Code [section] 667.5(c) are excluded from parole\"].) Although the regulations make use of Penal Code section 667.5 in defining \"nonviolent offender\" ( Cal. Code Regs., tit. 15, \u00a7\u00a7 3490, subds. (a)-(c), 3495, subd. (a) ), I do not believe we are required, when undertaking a holistic review of the constitutional provisions and the regulations themselves, to understand sections 3490, subdivision (c) and 3495, subdivision (b) in isolation, i.e., as the only means by which CDCR sought to flesh out the relevant constitutional term-\"nonviolent felony offense.\" Rather, CDCR was entitled, consistent with the text of Article I, Section 32 of our Constitution, to conclude that it was\n    appropriate to make use of the Penal Code's definition of \"violent felony\"\n    <em>\n     only concomitant with\n    </em>\n    a regulatory exclusion for those subject to sex offender registration.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    That conclusion is fully consistent with our decision in\n    <em>\n     Edwards\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12514860\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/237/673/#p1192\">\n     26 Cal.App.5th 1181\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12514860\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/237/673/#p1192\">\n     237 Cal.Rptr.3d 673\n    </extracted-citation>\n    because we were not there asked to decide the meaning and scope of \"nonviolent felony offense.\" Rather, CDCR conceded Edwards was imprisoned for a nonviolent felony offense and the issue for our decision was whether CDCR's formerly adopted regulations \"validly exclude admittedly nonviolent 'Third Strike' offenders sentenced to indeterminate [prison] terms from Proposition 57 relief.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at pp. 1184, 1186, 1191,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12514860\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/237/673/#p1192\">\n     237 Cal.Rptr.3d 673\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .) We, of course, held the answer was no, and importantly, that was our answer because there was an explicit textual basis in the constitutional provisions added by Proposition 57 that revealed barring relief for those serving indeterminate Three Strikes sentences was inconsistent with the voters' intent.

Elec. (Nov. 8, 2016) argument against Prop. 57, p. 59.) The proponents-including California's sitting Governor at the time (who was identified as such in the ballot pamphlet)-answered the charge that those convicted of sex crimes like human trafficking would benefit\n    from Proposition 57. In their rebuttal argument, they asserted Proposition 57 \"[d]oes not and will not change the federal court order that excludes sex offenders, as defined in Penal Code [section] 290, from parole.\" (Ballot Pamp., Gen. Elec. (Nov. 8, 2016) rebuttal to argument against Prop. 57, p. 59.) The \"federal court order\" referenced by the proponents was left unspecified, but the import of their assertion was clear enough to everyday voters: do not be alarmed, those sex offenders specified in Penal Code section 290 will be excluded from benefitting from early parole consideration.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    The ballot arguments are highly significant in my view because they help establish how voters expected, and we can infer intended, CDCR to more precisely define the group of offenders who would benefit from Proposition 57\n    that the text of the initiative left ambiguous at the margins.\n    <footnotemark>\n     3\n    </footnotemark>\n    (See generally\n    <em>\n     Valencia\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    , 3 Cal.5th at p. 364,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12513604\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/220/230/#p358\">\n     220 Cal.Rptr.3d 230\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12513604\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/220/230/#p358\">\n     397 P.3d 936\n    </extracted-citation>\n    [courts examine the materials before the voters to resolve questions of purpose and ambiguity].) Proposition 57's proponents assured voters that those required to register as sex offenders would not benefit from the initiative, and that assurance leaves me convinced voters did not intend to preclude CDCR from promulgating regulations that preclude relief for state prison inmates incarcerated for a current crime that requires registration as a sex offender.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    The problem in this case, of course, is that section 3496, subdivision (b) of CDCR's regulations was applied to bar early parole consideration for petitioner based not on an offense for which he is now incarcerated but on older crimes for which he was long ago released from prison. That is why I concur in the result reached by the majority.\n    <footnotemark>\n     4\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <footnote label=\"1\">\n    <p id=\"p-52\">\n     Also among them are those convicted of indecent exposure. (Pen.

(See, e.g., Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 236.1, subd. (b) [\"A person who deprives or violates the personal liberty of another with the intent to effect or maintain a violation of Section 266, 266h, 266i, 266j, 267, 311.1, 311.2, 311.3, 311.4, 311.5, 311.6, or 518 is guilty of human trafficking and shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison for 8, 14, or 20 years and a fine of not more than five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000)\"].) That is true even as to child pornography offenses, where some have argued such offenses are linked to crimes of violence, if not crimes of violence themselves. (See, e.g.,\n     <em>\n      American Booksellers Ass'n, Inc. v. Hudnut\n     </em>\n     (7th Cir. 1985)\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"338218\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/771/323/\">\n      771 F.2d 323\n     </extracted-citation>\n     , 328-329 &amp; fns. 1 &amp; 2 ;\n     <em>\n      United States v.

Indeed, CDCR's statement of reasons accompanying the formerly adopted regulations relied on just such a broad understanding of violence. (Cal. Dept. of Corrections, Credit Earning and Parole Consideration Final Statement of Reasons, April 30, 2018, p. 20 [\"The department has determined that these sex offenses demonstrate a sufficient degree of violence and represent an unreasonable risk to public safety to require that sex offenders be excluded from nonviolent parole consideration\"].)\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"3\">\n    <p id=\"p-54\">\n     It appears CDCR framed its overall approach to defining \"nonviolent felony offense\" by relying on the ballot arguments that provide helpful clues to voter intent where the text of the initiative does not. Just as the proponents of the measure argued \"[v]iolent criminals as defined in Penal Code [section] 667.5(c) are excluded from parole,\" CDCR's regulations exclude from early parole consideration those convicted of a violent felony within the meaning of that Penal Code provision. And just as the proponents assured sex offenders within the meaning of Penal Code section 290 would be excluded from parole, the regulations enforce that exclusion.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"4\">\n    <p id=\"p-55\">\n     Although I have said more than the majority does, there are still questions I too leave for another day, among them the question of whether an inmate incarcerated for indecent exposure could successfully challenge the sex offender regulatory exclusion as unconstitutional under Proposition 57 as applied to him or her.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
