Code, \u00a7 245, subd. (a)(2) )\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   with a true finding that he personally used a firearm during the commission of his crime (\u00a7 12022.5, subd. (a) ). On March 19, 2015, the trial court sentenced defendant to serve an aggregate term of 13 years in state prison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On May 17, 2018, defendant filed a motion to be resentenced pursuant to Senate Bill No. 620 (2017-2018 Reg. Sess.) (Senate Bill No. 620) that amended sections 12022.5, subdivision (c), and 12022.53, subdivision (h), effective January 1, 2018 (Stats. 2017, ch. 682, \u00a7\u00a7 1 &amp; 2, respectively). Pursuant to Senate Bill No. 620, defendant sought to have the firearm enhancement stayed. Senate Bill No. 620 amended the firearm enhancement statutes giving the trial courts discretion to strike such enhancements. The trial court summarily denied defendant's motion, finding the amendment to section 12022.5 granting trial courts discretion to stay such enhancements did not apply to defendant because his conviction was final.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Defendant appeals from that order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   An order made after judgment affecting a defendant's substantial rights is appealable. (\u00a7 1237, subd. (b).) However, once a judgment is rendered, except for limited statutory exceptions (\u00a7\u00a7 1170.126, 1170.18), the sentencing court is without jurisdiction to vacate or modify the sentence, except pursuant to the provisions of section 1170, subdivision (d). (See\n   <em>\n    Portillo v. Superior Court\n   </em>\n   (1992)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2326642\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/10/1829/#p1834\">\n    10 Cal.App.4th 1829\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1834-1835,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=13%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20709\">\n    13 Cal.Rptr.2d 709\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) Section 1170, subdivision (d), allows a sentencing court on its own motion to recall and resentence, subject to the express limitation that the court must act to recall the sentence within 120 days after committing the defendant to prison. (See\n   <em>\n    Dix v. Superior Court\n   </em>\n   (1991)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2358779\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-3d/53/442/#p464\">\n    53 Cal.3d 442\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 464,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=279%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20834\">\n    279 Cal.Rptr. 834\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=807%20P.2d%201063\">\n    807 P.2d 1063\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) Indeed, \"the court loses 'own-motion' jurisdiction if it fails to recall a sentence within 120 days of the original commitment. [Citations.]\" (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=807%20P.2d%201063\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) Defendant was committed to state prison and judgment was rendered when the trial court imposed sentence on March 19, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Defendant's motion for resentencing was not based on the trial court's limited authority to resentence under \u00a7 1170, subdivision (d). Instead, defendant argued he was entitled to resentencing under the recently enacted Senate Bill No. 620. The Legislature may give defendants whose judgments are final the benefits of newly enacted laws. (See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Teal v. Superior Court\n   </em>\n   (2014)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3991433\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-4th/60/595/#p600\">\n    60 Cal.4th 595\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 600,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=179%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20365\">\n    179 Cal.Rptr.3d 365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=336%20P.3d%20686\">\n    336 P.3d 686\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [\"Section 1170.126 creates a substantial right to be resentenced and provides a remedy by way of a statutory postjudgment motion\"] ). Senate Bill No. 620, however, does not contain language authorizing resentencing of convictions after they became final. And absent any new authority to resentence defendant under Senate Bill No. 620, the trial court lacked jurisdiction to grant defendant's resentencing request. (See\n   <em>\n    People v. Chlad\n   </em>\n   (1992)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2315447\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/6/1719/#p1725\">\n    6 Cal.App.4th 1719\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1725,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20610\">\n    8 Cal.Rptr.2d 610\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) Because the trial court lacked jurisdiction to modify defendant's sentence, denial of his motion to modify his sentence could not have affected his substantial rights. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 1726,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20610\">\n    8 Cal.Rptr.2d 610\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) Accordingly, the \"order denying [the] motion to modify sentence is not an appealable order,\" and the appeal must be dismissed. (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20610\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   DISPOSITION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The appeal is dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   We concur:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   BLEASE, Acting P.
