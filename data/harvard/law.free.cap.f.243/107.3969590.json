Rev. St. Neb. 1913, \u00a7 6300, provides that all property subject to taxation \u201cshall be valued at its actual value, * * and shall he assessed at 20 per cent, of its actual value.\u201d The valuation given in the circular was the actual value as fixed under such statute, and the assessed valuation was one-fifth of .that amount, but such fact was not stated and was not known to complainant. His bid was in the expectation of reselling the bonds to savings banks in New York and other Eastern states, by whose laws such bank were permitted to invest in bonds of municipalities whose net indebtedness should not exceed 7 per cent, of the valuation of their property for taxation. The indebtedness of Omaha was within such limit if the valuation given in the circular were taken, bat largely exceeded it upon the <em>assessed </em>valuation. The attorney general of New York had ruled that in such cases the assessed valuation was to be taken. <em>Held, </em>that whatever construction should bo placed on the statement of the circular or upon the statutes of the states limiting investments by savings banks, they were sufficiently uncertain to entitle complainant to be relieved from his bid on the ground of mistake in supposing that the statement referred to assessed valuation.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b121-14\">[Ed.

The circular stated that sealed bids would be received by the city council of the city of Omaha up to 8 o\u2019clock, p. m. of the 16th day of April, 1912, for the bonds described in the circular, viz. 600 bonds, of the denomination of $1,000 each; that bids must be accompanied by a certified check in the sum of $5,000, to be regarded as liquidated damages in case of failure on the part of the successful bidder to carry out his contract; that bids should be subject to bonds having been legally and regularly issued.

Cosgrove, Esq., Comptroller. City of Omaha, Nebraska.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b123-7\">\u00a1\u2018Dear Sir: In reference to <em>the </em>SGOO'.OOO of city <em>of </em>Omaha bonds awarded to ns, we telegraphed you on the 18th instant as follows: [Set out above.] We received your telegram on tbo 19th (dated the 18th), as follows: [Set out above.] As your telegram did not give us the necessary information, we wired you on the 19th as follows: [Set out above.] In answer to this last telegram we have received your telegram as follows: [Set out above.] In your circular dated March 28, 1912, inviting bids for the $600,000 of bonds, you stated, among <em>other </em>things, <em>in </em>reference to the financial condition of the city: \u2018Valuation for assessment purposes, 1912 (est\u2019d.), $161,167,720.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b123-8\">\u201cThis appearing to be an estimate, we inferred that the assessment rolls for 1912 had not been finally completed, and that the figures given were approximately correct. But to further assure ourselves with respect to the assessed valuation, we consulted our files, and found the circular dated July 15, 1911, signed Frank A. Furay, city treasurer, which invited proposals for $379,-000 city of Omaha street improvement bonds. Among tile other items set forth in said circular was, \u2018Assessed valuation, $151,331,701.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b123-9\">\u201cConstruing the two circulars, we concluded that the assessed valuation for purposes of taxation for the year 1912 would show an increase of some $13,000,000 over the assessed valuation for 1911. It appears, however, from your telegram received to-day, that the exact assessed valuation for 1911 was only $30,376,213, and that for 1912 the exact, assessed valuation is $31,779,681.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b123-10\">\u201cThe facts and figures above set forth raise a very interesting question. You are aware, as doubtless your predecessors have been, that the market for Omaha bonds, which has enabled the city to realize high prices for them, has been confined largely to the savings banks of certain Eastern states, which, by the laws affecting them, are permitted to invest their funds in the bonds of certain cities whose net indebtedness does not exceed a certain percentage o\u00ed the assessed valuation of property in such cities. In New York state the percentage is 7 per cent., and in the other states 5 per cent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b123-11\">\u201cWe bid for these bonds upon the faith of the representations contained in the circulars above referred to, to wit:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b123-12\">\u201c \u2018Assessed valuation for 1911.............................. $151,331,701\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b123-13\">\u201c \u2018Estimated assessed valuation, 1912....................... 164,167,720\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b123-14\">\u2014for the purpose of selling themd to savings banksmi the several states which would be legally allowed to buy them, if either of said statements of assessed valuation for 1911 or 1912 had been correct</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b123-15\">\u201cYou can imagine, therefore, that we are now considerably surprised to learn that the figures given for 1911 and 1912 are five times the amount of <em>the </em>assessed valuation. Under this condition, it is apparent that the bonds of the city of Omaha are no longer a legal investment for the banks in the states of New York, Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, and Itliodo Island, and we have just learned that the attorney general of the state of New York has so ruled in respect to this state.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b123-16\">\u201cIt is hardly necessary to call your attention to the fact that, with such a market closed to them, the bonds are not as valuable as they would otherwise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>be, and that we will he deprived of the market and profit which we had in view when we made our hid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b124-4\">\u201cIn our investigation, of this subject of assessed valuation, we have, among other things, been furnished with a statement of the financial statement of the school district of Omaha, as shown by official records of October 26, 1911.

It is urged in the brief of counsel for appellant that appellee had a complete and adequate remedy at law to recover the proceeds of the check accompanying his bid, and therefore a court of equity has no jurisdic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>tion of tlic present action. As to this point it is sufficient to say that where the subject-matter of a suit is within the jurisdiction of a court of equity and the objection that the complainant had an adequate remedy at law is not made until a hearing in the appellate court, the reviewing court will not consider the objection. Tyler v. Savage, 143 U. S. 79, 12 Sup. Ct. 340, 36 L. Ed. 82; Brown v. Lake Superior Iron Co., 134 U. S. 530, 10 Sup. Ct. 604, 33 L. Ed. 1021; Reynes v. Dumont, 130 U. S. 354, 9 Sup. Ct. 486, 32 L.

A. 158.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\">It appears from the record that the question as to whether appellee had an adequate remedy at law was in no wise raised in the court below. Moreover, the appellee may have had much difficulty in recovering in an action at law the 85,000 earnest money, with the contract created by the acceptance of his bid in full force. It was alleged, in the answer of appellant to the complaint of appellee and also in the brief of counsel, that appellee\u2019s objection to carrying out bis bid was not in good faith, but an attempt to cause the bonds to be sold to the next highest bidder, and the language contained in appellee\u2019s bid, requesting that the names and prices bid by the next two highest bidders should be telegraphed in case appellee became the successful bidder, is referred to in support of this charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> We have examined the testimony in the record carefully, and are clearly of the opinion that appellee acted in entire good faith in refusing to perform his bid. Appellee bases his right to recover upon two propositions: First, that tiie information contained in the circular of March 28, 1912, relating to the valuation for assessment purposes of the property of appellant for the year 1912, and also of the statement as to the tax rate for all purposes for 1912, per $1,000, were false, and placed in the circular by appellant with the intention of misleading persons who should desire to bid for the bonds offered for sale; second, if the statement shall be held to have been true, then appellee in bidding for the bonds acted under an honest mistake as to the material facts touching the assessed valuation and tax rate of appellant, and in either event he. is entitled to rescind the_coutract and recover the sum demanded. In this connection appellee claims that, if the language of the circular shall be construed to mean the assessed value of the property of appellant for the year 1912, then the statement was false and known to be so by appellant; and, if the statement shall be construed to be true, then appellee was justified in believing that the language referred to the assessed value of the property of appellant for taxation in the year 1912. In other words, he honestly believed that the assessed valuation of the property of appellant was five times the amount of the actual assessment and that the tax rate was in all one-fifth of the actual tax rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">The statement contained in the circular dated March 28, 1912, concerning valuation, is as follows: \u201cValuation for assessment purposes 1912, estimated.\u201d If this language is construed to mean the assessed value of property upon which the annual tax is to be levied, then the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>amount of $164,167,720 is false, because the assessed valuation for the year mentioned was $32,808,025.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">Appellant claims, however, that the words quoted,' when taken in connection with section 12 of the Nebraska Revenue Raw, supra, states the truth. Section 12 provides that all property subject to taxation shall be valued at its actual value, and shall be assessed at 20 per cent, of that value; that such assessed value shall be considered as the taxable value of such property and the value at which it shall be listed and upon which the levy shall be made. It therefore is claimed by appellant that, when its comptroller stated that the valuation for assessment purposes for the year 1912 was a certain amount, the statement referred to the actual value of the property subject to taxation, and not one:fifth of that amount provided hy law as the assessed value.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">Exhaustive arguments are made in the briefs on both sides for the purpose of showing how the language used with reference to valuation in the circular of March 28, 1912, should be construed, and cases are cited in support of the different contentions. Exhaustive arguments are also made as to how the laws of the different states in which appellee intended to sell bonds should be construed, with reference to the eligibility of municipal bonds as investments by savings banks in those states. But we think it is unnecessary to determine whether the statement in the circular of March 28, 1912, as to valuation, when properly construed, referred to the assessed value as defined by the Nebraska statute, or the actual value of all property subject to taxation. If it is a question upon which legal minds may differ, it certainly was a question concerning which appellee had a right to be honestly mistaken, and if in making his bid he honestly believed that the language referred to the assessed value of appellant\u2019s property for taxation, and not its actual value, then he would be entitled to refuse performance of the contract at the time he did when he learned the contrary, whether the language was used by appellant with the intention to deceive or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">Whether or not the bonds for which appellee made his bid were eligible in the savings bank market of the states mentioned would depend largely upon how the statement in the circular of March 28, 1912, should be construed and this was another question which appellee ought not to be held to decide at his peril, and furnishes another reason why, if he was honestly mistaken as to the meaning of the language used, he should be entitled to relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">The statement as to valuation contained in the circular was a statement of fact ahd material, however we may construe the language used. In Chicago v. Fishburn, 189 Ill. 367, 59 N. E. 791, it was decided under a statute similar to section 12, supra, that tire debt limitation should be computed upon the assessed valuation, and not upon the actual value which is ascertained in the process of fixing the assessed value. On the other hand, in the case of Halsey v. Belle Plaine et al., 128 Iowa, 467, 104 N. W. 494, under a statute of Iowa similar to section 12, supra, it was decided that the debt limit should be computed on the actual value and not on the assessed value.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>If these learned courts may differ as to the meaning of the different statutes, it is clear that appellee could be honestly mistaken as to the meaning of the language used in the circular of March 28, 1912, and his testimony that he thought the language referred to the assessed value stands uncontradicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\">We are satisfied from the evidence in the record that the judgment of the lower court was right. \u25a0 We base our decision upon the proposition that if the language used with reference to valuation in the circular of March 28, 1912, shall be construed to mean the assessed value of the property within the city of Omaha, then it was false, and it is immaterial whether it was intentionally false or not so far as appellee is concerned. If the language used shall be construed to refer to the actual value of the property within the city of Omaha for taxation, then on this record appellee was honestly mistaken as to the meaning of the language when he made his hid, and in either event he is entitled to rescind and recover the money deposited with his bid.

C.) 82 Fed. 255, affirmed in Moffett v. City of Rochester, 178 U. S. 386, 20 Sup. Ct. 957, 44 L. Ed. 1108.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">It is suggested by counsel for appellant that the mistake of appellee, if he was mistaken, was a mistake of law, and therefore not relievable in a court of equity. It may be conceded that as a general rule a mistake of law is not a ground for rescission of a contract, but there are exceptions to the rule. Snell v. Insurance Co., 98 U. S. 90, 25 L. Ed. 52. We do not think the mistake of appellee was one of law. lie testifies and it is uncontradicted, that he thought the valuation stated in the circular was the assessed valuation. As a matter of fact it was the actual value.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">It is further urged by counsel for appellant that the evidence shows that appellee was in some doubt as to the meaning of the language in regard to valuation contained in the circular of March 28, 1912, and thereupon he consulted the circular of July 15, 1911. Appellee testified that he consulted the circular of July 15, 1911, because of the use of the word \u201cestimated\u201d in the circular of March 28, 1912; that he inferred that the tax rolls had not been finally made up for 1912, and for that reason he consulted the circular of July 15, 1911, which gave the assessed valuation for 1911 at $151,331,701.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">We think app\u00e9llee had a right to rely upon the statements made in the circular, and that he did so rely when he made his hid; that the statement as to valuation was either false, or, if not, appellee was honestly mistaken in respect thereto when he made his bid, and in either event he is entitled to the relief prayed for.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
