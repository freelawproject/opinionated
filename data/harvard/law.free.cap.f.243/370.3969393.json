Bruns Company, a corporation. A composition was effected whereby the creditors received in settlement o\u00a3 their claims 50 per cent, thereof, as follows: Ten per cent. in. cash; 10 per cent. December 15, 1915; 10 per cent. January 15, \u20221916; five per cent, on the 15th of each of the months of February, March, April, and May, 1916\u2014notes being given for the deferred payments. It was agreed by the bankrupt, as a condition of the composition, that until the full payment' of all the composition notes the business of the company should be supervised by a committee of the creditors, and that in case of defauLt in payment of any of the notes, then after. 15 days the committee he authorized to \"take possession of the company\u2019s assets, and, in the discretion of the committee, dispose of same, and pay, first, its expenses; second, all of the composition notes, including a note held by the committee for expenses theretofore incurred; <em>and </em>the balance, if any, to <em>the </em>attorneys for the company. When the composition became effective the bankruptcy proceedings were discontinued, and the property of the corporation was turned over to the company, which thereupon, under the general direction of the creditors\u2019 committee, continued to run the business, selling some of the goods on hand, buying some new goods, and incurring some further indebtedness. The 10 per cent, cash payment, amounting to $2,500, was provided by appellee George O. Bruns, president and principal stockholder of the company, through a loan to him personally, and in the letter which Bruns sent out to the creditors, proposing the composition, it was stated that the $2,500 to make the first payment would be raised outside of the- assets of the company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b385-5\">Default being made in the payment of the composition notes, which matured February 15th, and the committee being unable to reach an agreement for further continuance of the business, on March SI, 1916, the committee, on behalf of the creditors, filed another petition in bankruptcy against the company, under which it was declared a bankrupt, and the appellant herein duly chosen trustee. Under date of October 30, 1915, the company, by Bruns, its president, executed a note to Bruns for $2,500, representing the amount which Bruns had borrowed and turned over for the purpose of making the first payment, in case the composition was carried through. The board of directors of the bankrupt did not authorize such note to Bruns. In the present bankruptcy proceeding Bruns filed this note as a claim against the bankrupt estate. To the claim so filed the trustee nfade objection upon the following grounds: \u2018\u2018First, said claim is colorable, fictitious, and invalid; second, said George C. Bruns is estopped from making said claim\u201d\u2014and asking that the claim be disallowed in its entirety. The referee in bankruptcy disallowed the claim, arid on review the District Court ordered the claim allowed. By this proceeding it is sought to reverse the order of the District Court allowing this claim!.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b385-6\">Henry J.

' But the note is of no necessary consequence, since it is the consideration, rather than the note itself, with which we are actually concerned. The claim is neither colorable, fictitious, nor invalid, and the trustee\u2019s first objection is not sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> Respecting the second objection, that Bruns is estopped from making the claim, reliance is placed mainly upon his representation to the creditors that funds for making the first cash payment of $2,500 were no part of the assets of the corporation. This was not directly or indirectly any representation that the person advancing this money, primarily for the benefit of the corporation and to help settle its debts, would not have therefor a claim against the corporation. We find nothing in the record to warrant the contention that Bruns, or any one else who would thus advance the money, should not be repaid by the corporation, and nothing because of which Bruns is estopped from making claim for it.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> Much of appellant\u2019s brief is devoted to showing that, out of the assets of the bankrupt, the claims based, on the composition notes should be first paid before appellee receives anything. However this may be, appellant\u2019s right to exhibit his demand, and to have it allowed as a claim against the bankrupt, is in no wise dependent upon the order of payment as between the various creditors of the bankrupt. His claim was provable, whether ultimately payable first or last. The objections of the trustee do not purport to raise any question of rank of the respective claims as to each other, nor does it appear that any of the other creditors who are directly interested in the question are asserting any right of priority over appellee; neither does the order of allowance of Bruns\u2019 claim assume to deal with any such question.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">The District Court properly allowed the claim, and its order of allowance is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
