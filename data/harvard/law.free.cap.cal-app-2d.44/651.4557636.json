Defendant exercised an option in the contract to extend it for an additional six months\u2019 period ending July 1, 1939. May 15, 1939, decedent was discharged by defendant for cause, decedent having without defendant\u2019s permission absented himself from defendant\u2019s studio on Friday, May 12th, Saturday, May 13th, and appeared for work for one hour only on Monday, May 15th.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-4\">Plaintiff relies for reversal of the judgment on these propositions :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-5\">\n<em>First: There is no substantial evidence to sustain the trial court\u2019s findings as follows:</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-6\">\n<em>(a) \u201cDefendant had certain rules and regulations made by it in the conduct of its business regulating the attendance and presence of its employees at its shidio. Said rules and regulations of defendant required plaintiff to appear and report at the studio during every business day, and forbade its employees, including plaintiff, to absent themselves from the studio without permission . . . and they were well known to and understood by plaintiff.\u201d</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-7\">\n<em>(b) \u201cThat it was necessary for the proper operation of defendant studio that its employees, including plaintiff George Nicholls, Jr., report for work on each business day and be available for conference with writers, directors, producers or other persons on the studio lot.\u201d</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-8\">\n<em>(c) \u201cOn May 12, 1939, and again on May 13, 1939, the writer, then working on said continuity, was at defendant studio in connection with such work. By reason of the absence of said plaintiff from said studio on said two days, as hereinbefore found, said writer was unable to discuss his work with plaintiff.\u201d</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-9\">\n<em>(d) \u201cThe acts of plaintiff, as aforesaid, were in wilful violation of the aforesaid rules and regulations made by defendant, and said absences of plaintiff were in violation of the provisions of plaintiff\u2019s contract of employment.\u201d</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-10\">\n<em>(e) \u201cThe Court further finds that one of the material elements in the performance by plaintiff of the terms of said contract of employment was that he should report for work and be available to defendant on each business day for whatever use defendant desired to make of him.\u201d</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-2\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>\n<em>Second: Decedent\u2019s absence from his work, even if it constituted a breach of contract, did not result in damage to defendant.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-3\">\n<em>Third: Even though decedent was properly discharged, he was entitled to compensation for the period of time prior to the effective date of his discharge.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">Plaintiff\u2019s first proposition is untenable. An examination of the record discloses that it was customary for a director such as decedent, while engaged in assisting writers in the preparation of script or continuity, to be present at the studio every day and available for consultation with the writers. It is conceded that decedent absented himself without defendant\u2019s permission from the studio on Friday, May 12th, Saturday, May 13th, and on Monday, May 15th, excepting for the period of an hour. During this period decedent had assigned to assist him writers in the preparation of a continuity of a motion picture entitled \u201cAbraham Lincoln Boggs\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">There was also evidence that decedent had been discharged by defendant on a prior occasion for absenting himself from his duties without the consent of defendant and in addition there was also evidence that decedent on other occasions when absenting himself from the studio had requested defendant\u2019s permission to absent himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">The foregoing evidence, with the reasonable inferences that may be drawn therefrom, substantially support each and every material finding of fact of the trial court set forth above. Further discussion of the evidence would therefore be superfluous, in view of the established rule that the power of an appellate court <em>begins </em>and <em>ends </em>with a determination as to whether there is any substantial evidence contradicted or uncontradicted which will support the findings of fact <em>(Estate of Winzeler, </em>42 Cal. App. (2d) 246 [108 Pac. (2d) 720]).</p>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">Plaintiff\u2019s second proposition is also untenable. An employer is justified in discharging his employee, when the latter fails to perform his duty, even though injury does not result to the employer as a result of the employee\u2019s failure to do his duty <em>(May </em>v. <em>New York M. Picture Corp., </em>45 Cal. App. 396, 404 [187 Pac. 785]).</p>\n<p id=\"b678-8\">Plaintiff\u2019s final proposition is likewise without merit. Decedent was paid Thursday, May 11, 1939, for his services <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>up to and including May 10, 1939. Thereafter and until May 15th, the effective date of his discharge, he was present at the studio on May 11th only. By the terms of his contract his compensation was due and payable on Thursday of each week for services rendered \u201cup to and including the Wednesday preceding.\u201d Since he breached his contract and was discharged prior to Thursday, May 18, 1939, the next day upon which compensation was due him, he was not entitled to any compensation for services rendered subsequent to May 10, 1939, the law being established in California that an employee dismissed by his employer for good cause is not entitled to any compensation for services rendered after the last day upon which a payment becomes due under the terms of a contract of employment <em>(Hartman </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>69 Cal. 643, 646 [11 Pac. 581]).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-3\">Por the foregoing reasons the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-4\">Moore, P. J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b679-5\">WOOD, J., Concurring.</author>\n<p id=\"AQg\">I concur in the judgment. The contract provides that defendant shall pay to the director $750 on Thursday of each week for services rendered the preceding week \u201con condition that the director shall fully and completely keep and perform each and every term and condition of this agreement on his part to be kept or performed\u201d. Under the express terms of the contract plaintiff may not recover for services rendered on May 11, 1939, or thereafter.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
