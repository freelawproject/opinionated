It appears that a motion for new trial was denied on January 21, 1941. Notice of denial of the motion was served on January 22, 1941, and filed on January 23, 1941. A motion to terminate proceedings for the preparation of a record on appeal was granted by the trial judge on March 28, 1941. Under these facts the motion to dismiss must be granted. <em>(Wright </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>43 Cal. App. (2d) 46 [110 Pac.
