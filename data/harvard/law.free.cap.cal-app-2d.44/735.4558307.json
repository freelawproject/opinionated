Appellant\u2019s contention is that she was the adopted daughter of decedent and thereby entitled to the entire estate; and that in any event the estate was derived from the separate property of Josephine Brandel\u2019s predeceased husband, the uncle of appellant, by reason of which she, as the assignee of some of the other relatives <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>of the predeceased husband, is entitled to five-sixths of the estate under the provisions of section 229 of the Probate Code. The court decreed distribution of the entire estate to the nieces and nephews of decedent, children of her predeceased sister and brother, under section 225 of the Probate Code; and denied appellant any interest therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">The basis of plaintiff\u2019s claimed adoption may be stated as follows: Appellant was born in Sweden in 1884, her father, who used the name of Sjoberg, being a brother of decedent\u2019s husband Carl Brandel. After the death of her mother she was placed in an orphanage and later in the home of a soldier and his wife, not shown to be relatives, who held the child in great affection. Following correspondence over a period of about two years between Carl Brandel and appellant\u2019s father in Sweden, Anna Marie Sjoberg or Brandel who was about seven years old at the time, was brought to this country to live with the Carl Brand\u00e9is in Kansas. A translation of the minutes of a meeting of the board of directors of the orphanage permitting her to be taken to America was introduced as an exhibit. The minutes recite that the father had petitioned that his daughter \u201cbe permitted to be taken to America to be brought up by\u201d her uncle \u201cCarl Brandel\u201d who \u201chas applied for, and offered to take up the girl as his own child \u2019 \u2019. The minutes further recited that the board gave its consent that the child be given to the applicant and her registry in the orphanage cancelled.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-7\">Appellant contends that her surrender by the Swedish orphanage and acceptance by the Brand\u00e9is, coupled with the fact that no other procedure requiring a statutory adoption was then available was in and of itself of effect sufficient to constitute a legal adoption.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-8\">The right of adoption is wholly statutory. The adoption by one person of another was unknown to the common law. There is no showing in the record that under the law of Sweden, or that of Kansas to which state appellant came, her release by an orphanage and acceptance into the home of the Brand\u00e9is would constitute adoption. It is not shown that Kansas recognizes such a form of adoption and our own research in that regard has in no respect been helpful to appellant\u2019s cause. (Code Civ. Proc., sec. 1875.) Appellant was an adult at the time of her arrival in California and the statutes of this state refer only to the adoption of minor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>children. (Civ. Code, sec. 221.) \u201cHe who claims that an act of adoption has been accomplished must show that every essential requirement has been complied with.\u201d <em>(Estate of Taggart, </em>190 Cal. 493, 498 [213 Pac. 504, 27 A. L. R. 1360].)</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">Appellant relies chiefly upon an alleged contract to adopt, which, had it existed, might have entitled her to an equitable remedy, or, under certain circumstances, relief in the probate court. <em>(Furman </em>v. <em>Craine, </em>18 Cal. App. 41 [121 Pac. 1007]; <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>102 Cal. App. 178 [283 Pac. 331].) Whether an alleged contract to adopt may be asserted in probate proceedings, or whether it must be made the subject of a separate suit in equity, is not a question of vital importance in this case. Assuming that appellant\u2019s right is in probate, the evidence as a matter of law does not compel the conclusion that Josephine and Carl Brandel or either of them agreed to adopt appellant. The trial court found against the existence of a contract of adoption. There is some slight evidence that the Brand\u00e9is may have intended to adopt appellant but the weight of the evidence is otherwise. It is not disputed that appellant was received into their home in Kansas and treated in many respects as their own child. Mrs. Brandel signed her school report cards in the space provided for the signature of a parent and several witnesses testified that the Brand\u00e9is referred to appellant as their daughter. Other witnesses, however, testified that she was referred to as their niece, and that Mrs. Brandel stated that she had not been adopted. The funeral notice at the time of the death of Mrs. Brandel stated that she was survived by her daughter Mrs. Lindgren, but a newspaper notice of Mr. Braudel\u2019s death gave her relationship to be that of a niece. Appellant referred to Mr. and Mrs. Brandel as Uncle and Aunty, and letters addressed to her by Mrs. Brandel are signed \u201cAunty\u201d. Invitations to the wedding of appellant, sent out by Mr. and Mrs. Brandel, referred to her as \u201ctheir niece Anna Marie\u201d. The evidence falls short in weight and sufficiency to prove that appellant is the adopted daughter or that the Braudels agreed to adopt her. Appellant contends that the words \u201ctake up\u201d as used in the minutes of the meeting of the board of directors of the orphanage are the equivalent of \u201cadopt\u201d. It does not appear that either of the Brand\u00e9is had any correspondence with the orphanage or that they accepted the child with the intention <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>of adopting her or that their conduct indicated that such was their intention. The Kansas eases cited are not in point. In <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>75 Kan. 117 [88 Pac. 743, 9 L. R. A. (N. S.) 229], a written contract provided that upon the death of a husband and wife the child taken over by them si muid receive \"all the property they died possessed of \u2019 \u2019. In <em>Hickox </em>v. <em>Johnston, </em>113 Kan. 99 [213 Pac. 1060, 27 A. L. R. 1322], an oral contract of the same nature was reduced to writing.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">In view of our approval of the decree on the question of adoption, it is not necessary to consider respondents\u2019 contention that under any alleged contract to adopt, the claims of appellant are barred by laches and the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-7\"> A further contention of appellant is that she is entitled to succeed to five-sixths of the estate of Mrs. Brandel under Probate Code, section 229. As the niece of Carl Brandel, the daughter of a predeceased brother, and the assignee of other relatives she contends that the property constituting the estate of Mrs. Brandel is derived either from property accumulated by Mr. Brandel prior to his marriage, or from property acquired by him in Kansas during marriage and before the Brand\u00e9is came to California. The Brand\u00e9is took up residence in this state in 1922; Carl Brandel died in 1926 and Mrs. Brandel died on or about March 25,1938. The petition for settlement of the first and final account and for final distribution and the objections thereto filed by appellant were heard on or about May 1, 1939. The probate court determined that no part of the estate of Carl Brandel or of the estate of Mrs. Brandel was community property; that cash on hand at the date of the latter\u2019s death was her separate property and \u201cThat the real property of said decedent described in said petition for distribution was purchased by decedent in her own name with funds brought into the State of California from the State of Kansas by the said decedent, which funds were derived by her from the sale of realty in the State of Kansas which stood of record in the name of said Josephine Brandel; that the change in status, if any, of any property of said Carl Brandel held by him in the State of Kansas in common law sole ownership to the separate property of Josephine Brandel took place in the State of Kansas prior to the establishment by said Josephine Brandel of her domicile in California.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>The evidence pertinent to this question and in support of the decree appears in part as follows: The Brand\u00e9is married in Kansas around 1888; shortly thereafter they purchased a home in the husband\u2019s name; subsequently this home was sold and a second purchased in the Avife\u2019s name; the second home AAas thereafter sold, part of the proceeds thereof being used to pay off a mortgage on the place, and the balance of approximately $3,000 placed in a Kansas bank and evidenced by a certificate of deposit issued to Mrs. Brandel. Part of this was AA\u00dathdrawn before the Brand\u00e9is moved to California and the balance thereafter. California property, paid for at least in part from funds growing out of the certificate of deposit was purchased in the name of Mrs. Brandel. If the original certificate of deposit or any issued in lieu thereof represented in whole or in part funds held by the husband in common law sole ownership in Kansas, the placing of such, funds in the name of the wife before they left Kansas indicates a gift to her, resulting in a change of ownership and constituting thereafter the separate property of the wife. The record does not show that appellant, upon whom the burden rested, established to the contrary. (Prob. Code, secs. 228, 229; <em>Estate of Simonton, </em>183 Cal. 53 [190 Pac. 442]; <em>Estate of Rattray, </em>13 Cal. (2d) 702 [91 Pac. (2d) 1042]; <em>Estate of Slack, </em>13 Cal. (2d) 721 [91 Pac. (2d) 1052].)</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">During the period that the Brand\u00e9is lived in Kansas, Mrs. Brandel received a small inheritance from the estate of her mother. Over a number of years she took in boarders. The evidence does not shoAv that Mr. Brandel acquired separate or community property after arrival in this state. After the death of her husband Mrs. Brandel worked as a servant and nurse; and the deposits of money in a California bank were made subsequent to the death of Mr. Brandel. Appellant failed to make a sufficient tracing of funds to enable the trial court to determine what part, if any, of Mrs. Brandel\u2019s estate was derived from property held in Kansas in common law sole ownership by the husband, which, upon its entry into California, became his separate property within the meaning of the law of this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">Each side relies upon <em>Estate of Allshouse, </em>13 Cal. (2d) 691 [91 Pac. (2d) 887], In that case husband and wife acquired property in Missouri during their marriage, which had it been acquired in California would have been community property. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>In Missouri it was held by the husband in common law ownership subject to the wife\u2019s dower right. The property was transferred to the wife either by gift before death or on distribution of his estate under the laws of Missouri. Later the wife came to California and was continuously domiciled here up to the time of her death. The court held that while at the time of her death the property acquired in Missouri had more of the incidents of California separate property than of community property, it nevertheless differed in its incidents from separate property acquired in California, for which reason section 229 did not apply. The effect of this conclusion was to exclude the husband\u2019s relatives entirely, leaving the property to descend under Probate Code, section 225. Had the husband brought into this state property which he at that time held in common law sole ownership, and thereafter it had been given, bequeathed or permitted to descend to the wife, section 229 would be applicable upon the wife\u2019s subsequent death intestate. We do not construe the decision as applying to property other than such as was held by the husband in common law sole ownership, and transferred by him to his wife prior to the parties coming to California.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">The facts of the present ease differ from those of the Allshouse case in that in the latter the husband died before the wife came to California bringing the property with her. The Brand\u00e9is came to California before the death of the husband. In <em>Estate of Allshouse, supra, </em>699, the court said: \u201cHad the husband brought the property to this state, or had he become domiciled here, the rule would be different, for it is well settled that foreign property, when subjected to the laws of a community property jurisdiction, may be reclassified thereunder. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b765-7\">In the present case the court found as to a parcel of real property constituting part of the estate of Mrs. Brandel, that it was purchased by her in her own name with funds derived from the sale of realty in Kansas which stood of record in her name, and that if the realty could be traced back to any property held by Mr. Brandel in common law sole ownership, its status had been changed, and it had become the separate property of Mrs. Brandel before she left Kansas with her husband. The court further found that the cash on hand had been acquired after the death of her husband, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>that the wife received none of it by gift or otherwise from her .husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-3\">It is contended that where the assets are mingled in California, the resultant fund constitutes community property, and that if that property would be community property here, then it should be construed so to be when it is brought from another jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-4\">In <em>Truelsen </em>v. <em>Nelson, </em>42 Cal. App. (2d) 750 [109 Pac. (2d) 996], cited by appellant, the husband placed his earnings in his wife\u2019s bank account. The decision is entirely foreign to the facts herein. No question of bringing funds into this state was involved. The legal principles involved in the Porter case are correct as applied to the facts of that case, but here appellant failed to prove a commingling of funds either here or in Kansas.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">The portion of the decree appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">Peters, P. J., and Knight, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-7\">Appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied July 7, 1941.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
