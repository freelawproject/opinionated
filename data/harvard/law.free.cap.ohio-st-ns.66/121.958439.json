The defendant excepted to this order of the court, and the defendant not desiring leave to amend said second defense and not amending the same as ordered, the court, struck it from the answer, and to this order the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b143-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>The case went to trial by jury on the first defense, and the plaintiff obtained a verdict for the amount demanded in the petition, for which the court rendered judgment, and overruled the motion of defendant for a new trial. The defendant prosecuted error in the circuit court where the judgment of the common pleas court was affirmed. The case comes to this court on error, but the principal error relied on for reversal is the order of the trial court requiring the second, defense to be made certain and definite as stated in the order, and striking the defense from the answer for noncompliance therewith.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b143-6\"><em>Messrs, Gregg, Patton &amp; Gregg, </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b143-7\">The defendant has the right to put in issue all the elements that go to make a valid instrument, to-wit: the execution, delivery and consideration.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b143-8\">The execution and delivery being denied, the question of consideration becomes important to prove or disprove the execution and delivery and to take this question from the case therefore bar the introduction of testimony thereon, affected a substantial right of the defendant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b143-9\">The court in passing on a question of this character should take into consideration the facts as pleaded, and determine it in the light of the particular facts in the case, and should consider the allegations of the first defense.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b143-10\">The defense relied on being forgery there could be no facts or circumstances^ within the defendant\u2019s knowledge to enable him to comply with the order of the court. All he could do would be to allege it in general terms as was done in this ease. There<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>fore, it would be impossible to comply with the order of the court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b144-5\">The form of answer adopted in this case was taken from the case of <em>Pavey </em>v. <em>Pavey, </em>30 Ohio St., 600, where it was held good.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b144-6\">In the cases of <em>Pavey </em>v. <em>Pavey, </em>30 Ohio St., 600, and <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>8 Circ. Dec., 752; 16 C. C. R., 103, the execution and delivery of the note in question was admitted by the defendant. And the execution and delivery being admitted, there must be facts within the defendant\u2019s knowledge that show a failure or want of consideration, if there is in fact a want or failure of consideration.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b144-7\">The pleading in question did not come within the provisions of Sec. 5088, Rev. Stat. The precise nature of the defense was pleaded, to-wit: \u201cNo consideration.\u201d The plaintiff was apprised of the character of the defense.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b144-8\">Between the original parties to a promissory note, the facts are as much within the knowledge of the payee as the maker; and such payee could not be taken by surprise. 6 Ency.

It is contrary to the letter and the spirit of our system of jurisprudence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b144-10\">The distinction between pleading want and failure of consideration that we have insisted on in this case has been recognized by the courts of many of the states. 4 Ency.

Sections 5087, \u20225071 and 5082, Rev. Stat.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b145-7\">It is only redundant, irrelevant or scurrilous matter that the court has power to order stricken from a pleading and there can be no claim made that this pleading was of that character. And the fact the court had sustained a motion to make more definite and certain cannot change the rule. <em>Long </em>v. <em>Newhouse, </em>57 Ohio St., 348.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b145-8\">The Supreme Court has also held that the adoption of our code has broadened the practice pertaining to the administration of justice as it existed before the code. <em>Peter </em>v. <em>Foundry &amp; Mach. Co., </em>53 Ohio St., 534.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b145-9\">The court also erred in admitting the note in evidence and overruling the demurrer of defendant to plaintiff\u2019s evidence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b145-10\">There was no evidence whatever offered to prove the defendant Booco ever executed the note in question.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b145-11\">Before the note would be competent evidence there must be proof offered of the execution and delivery.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b146-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>The execution being proved, the possession of the payee of the note might be sufficient evidence of the delivery; but there being no proof that Booco signed the note \u00f3r authorized any one else to sign it, he could only be liable by having adopted the instrument as. his under circumstances that would create an estoppel from denying the adoption.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b146-5\">In the hands of a <em>bona fide </em>holder for value, the adoption of the note would be binding, but as between the original parties, where no one is misled, the authorities are divided as to the effect of the adoption of a forged signature, some holding the purported maker liable; others, the contrary rule. Tiedeman Com. Paper, 399; 2 Daniel Neg. Instruments, 360.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b146-6\">And the weight of authority and the reason is. with the latter rule.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b146-7\">The note sued on was non-negotiable and did not. contain the words \u201cvalue received\u201d or any words of similar purport. It would not come within the rule of instruments that' import a consideration and a. good or valuable consideration must be proved.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A5b\">The courts hold that the words \u201cvalue received\u201d' over the signature of the maker is an acknowledgment of a consideration, and <em>prima facie </em>evidence, which is sufficient to put the burden on the defendant, to show there was no consideration. But no such rule applies where these words are omitted and the note is non-negotiable. 14 Ency. Pl. &amp; Pr., 482; 2 Greenleaf Ev., 152; Tiedeman Com.

A gift of one\u2019s own note is a delivery of a promise only and not the thing promised. <em>Hamor </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>8 Ohio St., 239; <em>Starr </em>v. <em>Starr, </em>9 Ohio St., 74; Swan\u2019s Treatise, 518.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b147-9\">The allegations of the first defense in the answer consisted of new matter within the meaning of Sec. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>5079, Rev. Stat. <em>Hauser </em>v. <em>Metzger, </em>1 C. S.

Van Demin &amp; Chaffin, </em>for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b148-8\">Brief of <em>Mr. Frank A. Chaffin.</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b148-9\">Complaint is made by plaintiff in error that the court erred in ruling that be should make bis answer more definite and certain, and on bis refusal to do so, it was error \u201cto strike it from the files.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b148-10\">This we think is the only question in the case that might be open to argument, and this, we claim, has been settled by the court in the case of <em>Chamberlain v.Railway Co., </em>15 Ohio St., 225, and followed by the circuit court in <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>8 Circ. Dec., 752; 16 C. C. R., 103.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b148-11\">The court will observe that the defendant, in bis answer, undertook to plead two separate and distinct defenses.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b148-12\">The first entirely different from the second. The second in no way containing any part of the first, either by incorporating its language, or by reference, as was done in <em>Hammond </em>v. <em>Earle, </em>58 How. Pr., 426, 1 Kinkead Code, Pl. &amp; Pr., Secs. 78 and 20. Consequently both must be complete in and of themselves. Kinkead P. &amp; P., p. 84; <em>Reid </em>v. <em>Huston, </em>55 Ind., 173; <em>Bank </em>v. <em>Green, </em>33 Ia., 140. It is but begging the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>question to say that the allegations in the first defense aids the second.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b149-6\">We submit that the first defense does not plead forgery \u2014 even if defendant had incorporated its allegation in his second defense. We admit it bears the ear-marks of having been drawn to suit the occasion \u2014 and reads \u201cthat said defendant did not make <em>and </em>deliver the promissory note,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b149-7\"><em>He </em>might not have <em>made </em>it, and yet <em>delivered </em>it. He might not have <em>delivered </em>it and yet <em>made </em>it. In either event it would not be forgery, and if there was any error in this case, we think it was committed when the court overruled the motion of plaintiff to said first defense.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b149-8\">Had defendant denied \u201cthat he made <em>or </em>delivered,\u201d or had he stated in his answer \u201cthat.he neither made, <em>nor </em>delivered said note,\u201d then his first defense would have been well pleaded, and in accordance with the case of <em>Winchell </em>v. <em>Crider, </em>29 Ohio St., 480; Kinkead Form, 337.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b149-9\">Another claim is made, viz.: \u201cThat the court has no power to strike out of the pleading, any matter except such as is specified in Ohio Rev. Stat., Sec. 5087.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b149-10\">If this is true, then not only the lower courts, but the Supreme Courts as well, have \u2022 been erring for years. <em>Commissioners </em>v. <em>Hoaglin, </em>5 Kan., 558.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b149-11\">To the answer to argument of the plaintiff in error that \u201cthe allegations of the first defense consisted of new matter and there being no reply filed, the facts; under the code, therein stated, stand admitted.\u201d We say there\u201d was no necessity for a reply. But for sake of argument, \u00e1dmit the answer set up new matter requiring one. The defendant did not complain in the lower court; did not ask for judgment on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>pleadings, but proceeded to try the case, and after the jury decided that he should pay, and the case had reached the circuit court, he then complained because no reply had been filed. ' If defendant had actually pleaded new matter, and plaintiff refused to reply, he might have demanded judgment on the pleadings, and then if the court had refused that judgment and forced him to trial, there might have been some ground for dissatisfaction. But such is not the case here, and under the circumstances, it looks as though he was simply \u201claying up for the second heat,\u201d not knowing that Judge Okey, as far back as 1883, had \u201cdropped the flag\u201d on such proceedings and made it a matter of record in the case of <em>Lovell </em>v. Wentworth, 39 Ohio St., 614.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b150-5\">And in so doing only followed <em>Woodward </em>v. Sloan, 27 Ohio St., 592; <em>Randall </em>v. <em>Turner, 17 </em>Ohio St., 262; <em>Fretz v. Stover, </em>89 U. S. (22 Wall.), 198; <em>Clements </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>73 U. S. (6 Wall.), 299; <em>White </em>v. <em>Richmond, </em>16 Ohio, 5.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b150-6\">But we claim no reply was necessary. The question made, because the note was non-negotiable, has been settled by <em>Dugan </em>v. <em>Campbell, 1 </em>Ohio, 115; <em>Ring </em>v. <em>Foster, </em>6 Ohio, 279, and <em>Howe </em>v. <em>Hartness, </em>11 Ohio St., 449; <em>Leonard </em>v. <em>Sweetzer, </em>16 Ohio, 1.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b150-7\">On the question of consideration, we are compelled to hold different views from those expressed by counsel for Booco, and insist there is quite a difference between a promissory note and a book account.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b150-8\">The former is signed t&gt;y the debtor, and thereby acknowledged, and a written promise to pay it. The latter is made up entirely by the creditor, and is only his memoranda against the debtor.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b151-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>It can make no difference, whether this note was negotiable or not, whether it contained the words \u201cvalue received\u201d or not, the defense relied on was forgery. It was a <em>promissory </em>note, even though not negotiable, nor containing the words \u201cvalue received,\u201d and the case of <em>Dalrymple </em>v. <em>Wyker, </em>60 Ohio St., 108, can be of no benefit to their side of the contention. In fact it decides that \u201cconsideration\u201d is presumed in promissory notes.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b151-6\">Was this a promissory note?</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b151-7\">It is useless to cite authorities. There is none but holds that all that is required is \u201ca written promise to pay, to a person named, a certain sum of money, absolutely at a time therein named!\u201d 2 Blackstone, 467; 3 Kent, 74; Chitty, 585; 1 Daniel, 36; Story, Sec. 1; Bouvier Law Dic.</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b151-8\">Some authorities go so far as to say, that the time of payment need not be definitely fixed. Randolph, Secs. 7,178; Byles, 87; Chitty, 79-184; 1 Daniel, 117; 1 Parsons, 193; Story, Sec. 63; Story on Prom. Notes, Sec. 51.

And the second defense pleads generally, that the alleged instrument is without any consideration to support it. This being its character the plaintiff below, by motion, asked the court to require the defendant to make this ground of his defense definite and certain \u201cby setting forth the facts and circumstances connected with said <em>note </em>which render it'without consideration and void,\u201d and \u201cby <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>setting forth a complete statement of facts upon which said second defense is based.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">This motion was sustained and thereby the defendant was required to so reform and amend the plea, as to set out \u201cthe facts and circumstances connected with said <em>note </em>which render it without consideration and void,\u201d and \u201cto set out therein a complete statement of the facts upon which said second defense is based.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">The defendant did not so amend, and for want of compliance with the order, the defense was stricken from the answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-8\">Was this error? is the only important question before us. There can be no doubt, that the plea of want of consideration for a note is entirely consistent with a denial of its execution and' delivery, for under the liberal provisions of our code of practice, the defendant may set forth in his answer as many grounds of defense as he may have, whether they are legal or equitable in character, subject to the limitation, that such several defenses must be consistent with each other. Revised Statutes, Sec. 5067. This court held in <em>Pavey </em>v. <em>Pavey, </em>30 Ohio St., 600, that, in an action on a note, the defendant may plead a denial of its execution and that there was no consideration therefor, and that it is error in such case to require the defendant to elect upon which of the two defenses he will proceed to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-9\">If the note is not genuine, as alleged in the-first ground, it had no consideration as alleged in the second ground of defense, and we think that the defendant had not only the right to these consistent defenses, but he had the right to be consistent in his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>\u2022evidence to support them. So, if the instrument sued on is not genuine, what facts and circumstances connected with it, could he set out? Indeed, it is difficult .to see how the defendant could have complied with the order made in the case, without abandoning his first defense, or at least, very greatly compromising it. If he should set out \u201cfacts and circumstances connected with the <em>note </em>which renders it without consideration,\u201d the plea so framed might at once be construed as admitting the execution of the instrument, and the very compliance with the order, if it could be complied with, would present an apparent inconsistency between the two defenses. And why should statements of facts be required in this case? The suit is between the payee and the alleged maker of the note. It lacks the usual words \u201cfor value received,\u201d and is not negotiable in form. Every fact surrounding its execution is, or could be, as well known to the plaintiff as to the defendant. If the note is not genuine, her knowledge about its origin is far superior to his. On the other hand, if the defendant made and delivered it, the plaintiff would not be .a stranger to \u201cthe facts and circumstances\u201d connected with its execution; and we think there is no necessity for the enforcement of the strict rule laid down by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">We do not intend to unduly circumscribe the discretion and control which the court has over the filing and reformation of pleadings, but to say, that owing to the character of the two grounds of defense, the court erred in sustaining the motion complained of and in striking the defense from the answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">The case of <em>Chamberlain </em>v. <em>Railway Co., 15 Ohio </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>St., 225, is cited to justify the action of the lower \u2022court. There were several questions involved in that case, and the least of all was, the effect of going to trial without objection, where one of the defenses to a promissory note is a plea in general terms, that it is wdiolly without consideration; and this court there decided that, if the plaintiff, without requiring a statement of the facts on which the defense is based, joins issue, any evidence is admissible on the trial, that tends to impeach or sustain the consideration. And the distinguished judge announcing the opinion, referring to the general terms of the plea, said: \u201cthis the plaintiff might have required to be made more definite, by a statement of the facts upon which the defense was based; but he waived this right and joined issue. * *</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">And further examination of that case shows, that the defendant admitted the execution of the note in suit. He had subscribed to the stock of the railroad company, and had paid a number of installments thereon, and gave the note sued on in settlement of the other assessments, and among other defenses, we need not mention here, was the general plea that the note was without consideration. The feature of that case which readily distinguishes it from the case at bar, is that there the note was genuine, while here its execution is denied. It is the ordinary application of the rule that the syllabus and opinion in a case should be considered in the light of its issues and facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">It is our judgment that the court erred in sustaining the plaintiff\u2019s motion to the second defense, and that the error was continued in striking it from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>answer, for which error the judgments of the circuit court and the court of common pleas are reversed, \u25a0and the case is remanded for new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b156-6\">Williams, O.
