It is but a decent respect due to the wisdom, the integrity, and the patriotism of the legislative body by which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>any law is passed, to presume in favor of its validity, until its violation of the constitution is proved beyond all reasonable doubt. To be in doubt, therefore, is to be resolved, and the resolution must support the law. Cooley on Const. Law, 160; <em>Supervisors </em>v. <em>Brogden, </em>112 U. S., 261; <em>Railway Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioners, </em>1 Ohio St., 77; <em>State </em>v. <em>Garver, </em>13-23 O. C. C., 140.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b579-6\">II. A county salary law is constitutional. <em>Cricket </em>v. <em>State, </em>18 Ohio St., 9.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b579-7\">It is not essential to the exaction of fees that they should inure to the personal benefit of the officer. The officers are but the agents of the state for transacting the public business, and it is immaterial to those receiving their services whether the sum to be paid therefor goes to the officer or into the public treasury, pro-' vided no more is exacted than is just and reasonable for the facilities afforded and the service performed. <em>State </em>v. <em>Judges, </em>21 Ohio St., 1.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b579-8\">In the case of <em>Hart </em>v. <em>Murray, </em>48 Ohio St., 605, the court, construing the act of May 15, 1886, placing the justices of the peace of Cleveland on a salary, says: \u201cBut it is contended that the act of May 15,1886, is a law of a general nature which does not have a uniform operation throughout the state, and is therefore in violation of Sec. 26 of Art. 2 of the constitution. The act, in our view, is local in its character. Its design is to regulate the amount of compensation to local officers, and does not come within the constitutional inhibition.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b579-9\">The system of compensation provided by the act is complete without reference to the penalties for official misconduct prescribed by Sec. 13, or to the effect to be given to an official bond by Sec. 14 of the act. Wherefore this system of compensation may be separated from and executed independently of these two sec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>tions and is not affected by the question of tbe constitutionality of either or both of them. <em>Pearson </em>v. <em>Stephens, </em>56 Ohio St., 126.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b580-5\">Since the decision in the Miami county case, <em>Pearson </em>v. <em>Stephens, supra, </em>similar salary laws have been passed for the following counties: Brown, 93 O. L., 574; Holmes, Ib. 660; Pickaway, Ib., 507; Tuscarawas, Ib., 513; Athens, 94 O. L., 697; Clermont, Ib., 408; Crawford, Ib., 581; Erie, Ib., 459; Fayette, Ib., 599; Highland, Ib., 412; Knox, Ib., 510; Lawrence, Ib., 549; Marion, Ib., 672; Meigs, Ib., 432; Morrow, Ib., 689; Muskingum, Ib., 681; Ottawa, Ib., 453; Putnam, Ib., 622.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b580-6\">Thus the people of eighteen counties, relying upon that decision, have prevailed upon the general assembly to give them county salary laws. Will this court reverse that decision in face of the arguments advanced by the able judge who rendered that decision? And when they know that by so doing the county affairs of eighteen counties will be plunged into hopeless and almost inextricable confusion.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b580-7\">III. When did the first twelve sections go into effect?</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b580-8\">The question is answered in two cases. <em>State </em>v. <em>Perry Co. </em>(Comrs.), 5 Ohio St., 497, and <em>Noble </em>v. <em>Noble Co. (Comrs.), </em>5 Ohio St., 524. The court held that for the purposes of the vote, the acts took effect on their passage, though their operative effect was made dependent upon a vote of approval by a majority of the electors voting therefor. <em>State </em>v. <em>Garver, </em>13-23 O. C. C., 140.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b580-9\">Applying the above rule also disposes of plaintiff in error\u2019s query as to whether Sec. 13 required a vote In the whole state, as to a local act. The relator in bis petition says, \u201cThe taking effect of said act is made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>to depend upon a vote of the electors of Holmes county.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b581-6\">Applying the above rule also disposes of relator\u2019s claim that printing the question on the general ballot instead of a separate ballot was illegal. If relator had any objections against printing the question on the general ballot instead of on a separate ballot, he might have raised the question at the time by injunction, in which case he would not now be here contending that the salary law deprives him of his <em>per diem </em>under Sec. 897, Rev. Stat.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b581-7\">IY. Submission to voters is constitutional.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b581-8\">The decision of the circuit court in this case contains a very able and thorough discussion of this point and we cite <em>State </em>v. <em>Garver, supra, </em>and by reference make the same a part hereof. Compare the concluding paragraph with the conclusion in <em>Gordon </em>v. <em>State, </em>46 Ohio St., 607.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b581-9\">But it is not always essential that a legislative act should be a contemplated statute which must in any event take effect as law, at the time it leaves the hand of the legislative department. A statute may be conditional, and its taking effect may be made to depend upon some subsequent event. Cooley on Const. Lim., 337-138.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b581-10\">It is worthy of consideration, however, whether there is anything in the reference of a statute to the people for acceptance or rejection which is inconsistent with the representative system of government. To refer it to the people to frame and agree upon a statute for themselves would be equally impracticable and inconsistent with the representative system; but to take the opinion of the people upon a bill already framed by representatives and submitted to them is not only practicable, but is in precise accordance with the mode <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>in which the constitution of the state is adopted and with the action of many other cases.

L., 660) which is drawn in question in these cases, is in conflict with the first clause of Sec. 26, Art. 2 of the constitution. For the reasons for our conclusion on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>this point we refer to <em>State ex rel. Guilbert </em>v. <em>Yates, ante, </em>page 546, which reasons need not be repeated here. This act is unconstitutional, also because it is conditioned to take effect only upon the result of an election by the people (Constitution, Art. 2, Sec. 26, second clause). Section 13 of the act provides for a vote upon the proposition, \u201cFor the county salary law. Against the county salary law;\u201d and then provides that <em>if </em>a majority of the votes cast on said proposition shall be in favor of a salary law the act \u201cshall take effect and be in force\u201d from and after a day named, otherwise' that the act should be <em>void. </em>The act cannot take effect under the Revised Statutes, Sec. 77, because it contains a provision as to the time when it shall take effect and be in force, if at all. Hence the taking effect, as well as the enforcement of the statute, is made to depend on the approval of another authority than the general assembly, namely, the will of a majority of the electors. The entire legislative power of the state is vested in the general assembly (Constitution, Art. 2, Sec. 1), and even without the limitation contained in Sec. 26, Art. 2, it could not be delegated. It was held in <em>Railroad Co. v. Commissioners, </em>1 Ohio St., 77, 87, which was a case under the constitution of 1802, that the power of the general assembly to pass laws could not be delegated by them to any other body or to the people; and this proposition is abundantly sustained by numerous authorities cited in the brief of the plaintiff in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">The cases of <em>State ex rel. </em>v. <em>Commissioners, </em>5 Ohio St., 497; <em>Noble et al. </em>v. <em>Commissioners, </em>5 Ohio St., 524; <em>Peck </em>v. <em>Weddell, </em>17 Ohio St., 271, and <em>Newton et al. </em>v. <em>Commissioners, </em>26 Ohio St., 618, were all cases in which it was required by the consti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>tution (Art. 2, Sec. 30) before the taking effect of the laws that they should be submitted to the electors of the counties to be affected thereby and adopted by a majority of the electors voting at such election. In each of those cases the question was whether some other thing than the voting was necessary before the law could \u201ctake effect;\u201d and the court held that the acts became laws when adopted by a majority of the electors of the county, but that the legislative intention was that the law should not be enforced until the condition precedent should be performed. In <em>Trustees </em>v. <em>Cherry et al., </em>8 Ohio St., 564, the court held that the vote which was required was a condition precedent to make an assessment to pay for the grounds which the trustees were authorized by the act to purchase. In <em>Gordon </em>v. <em>State, </em>46 Ohio St., 607, the act in question provided that it should take effect and be in force from and after its passage; but the question was whether the local option provision contained in the act rendered it unconstitutional. The court held that the act \u201cwas a complete law when it had passed through the several stages of legislative enactment and derived non\u00e9 of its validity from the vote of the people. In all its parts it is an expression of the will of the legislative department of the state.\u201d Our conclusion is that there is nothing either in principle or the decisions of this court contravening the view which we have expressed concerning the effect of Sec. 13 of the act (93 0. L., 660). It affects the whole act and the act is as if it never had been passed.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">Judgment o&gt;f the circuit court and of the court of common pleas <em>Reversed.</em></p>\n<judges id=\"b585-7\">Buricet, Shauck and Price, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b585-8\">Spear, J., concurs in the judgment of reversal and in the second proposition of the syllabus.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
