Stothfang. On April 16, 1898, Stothfang paid to Dibowski the interest due, and gave a new note for the principal sum, due in one year, signed by -himself, F. H. Stothfang and Louisa Stothfang, and before delivery it was endorsed by defendant in error, Henry Dieckmann. This note was not paid when it matured, and after being protested for non-payment, Dibowski threatened to bring suit against the makers and endorser, and to prevent suit against him, and to take up the note on which he was liable as endorser, by a mutual arrangement between all the parties, defendant in error Henry Dieckmann, in satisfaction of the former note, gave his individual note to Dibowski for the one thousand dollars due one year after date with six per cent, interest per annum, and secured its payment by mortgage on real estate. This note and the mortgage are dated May 12, 1899. As a consideration for the giving of said note and mortgage by Dieckmann to Dibowski, H. F. and F. H.

You are to keep possession of the warehouse receipts and the insur\u00bfnce policies for the swhiskey which you have as collateral security for loan to me and after these loans are fully paid up to you, the balance of the warehouse receipts are to be turned over to Henry Dieckmann or to' O.

F. Stothfang for a year or more, prior to the transaction, was in partnership with his brother, F. H. Stothfang, and they did business under the firm name of H. F. Stothfang &amp; Brother, but said partnership was dissolved and H. F. continued the business, assuming its liabilities and taking its assets.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b278-5\">At the time of the execution of the note signed by Dieckmann and prior thereto H. F. Stothfang was insolvent, and so continued insolvent, but Dieckmann had no knowledge of said insolvency.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b278-6\">On the the 7th of August, 1899, H. F. Stothfang made a general assignment under the laws of the state of Ohio for the benefit of creditors, to August H. Bode, and the deed of such assignment was filed in the court of insolvency of Hamilton county on the same day, and the assignee accepted the trust and duly qualified.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b278-7\">The warehouse receipts representing said whiskey, being then in the possession of the Atlas National Bank, were sold by the assignee and realized about $2,300, leaving in the hands of the assignee at the time, a balance of $1,300, after having paid the Atlas National Bank in full under order of the insolvency court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b278-8\">A further fact agreed upon is:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b278-9\">\u201cThat at the time the assignee sold the whisky under the order of the insolvency court, the bank having the warehouse receipts in its possession declined to turn them over to the assignee until the bank had its claim paid. The bank further declined to turn them over to the assignee until Dieckmann or his counsel consented to it, the bank having accepted the notice sent by Dieckmann\u2019s counsel. Dieckmann\u2019s counsel declined to consent to the turning over of the warehouse receipts at that time, and immediately went to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>the insolvency court, and that court made an entry before the warehouse receipts were turned over to the assignee and purchaser, reserving all the rights of Dieckmann.*\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b279-4\">Whatever right Dieckmann had or has were preserved by an entry made by the court of insolvency, a copy of which is as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b279-5\">\u201cIt appearing to the court that upon a lot of 165 barrels of whiskey sold by the assignee herein, the Atlas National Bank, Henry Dieckmann and C.

F. Stothfang, claiming that Dieckmann is entitled to share in the proceeds only as a general creditor, and that the above arrangement between him and the assignor is void under section 6343, Revised Statutes.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b279-7\">On these facts the court of common pleas found for Dieckmann, and made an order for his payment accordingly. A new trial was refused and error was prosecuted in the circuit court, where the judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>of the common pleas was affirmed, and August Hunt, a creditor of the assignor prosecutes error in this court, to obtain a reversal of the judgments of the lower,courts.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b280-5\"><em>Mr. Charles F.

Up to that time they were not in such condition as the law requires for a pledge. The placing them in such a condition afterwards, by Cavaroc\u2019s removing them from the bank at the time of its failure, was, in fact, an attempt to create a pledge then, by assuming the possession requisite thereto. <em>Casey </em>v. <em>Bank, </em>96 U.

'</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b285-12\">So a conveyance made by the principal to the surety in consideration of an agreement by the surety to pay the debt, is valid as against the creditors of the principal.

Thus, if the alleged default were owing to the creditor\u2019s misconduct, the surety will not be held liable. Again, if the principal debtor has not made default at all, the surety is not liable. DeColyar\u2019s Law of Guarantees, and Principal and Surety (2 Eng. ed.), p. 146.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b286-6\">It is admitted that the security was taken by Dieckmann in good faith, without knowledge of the insolvency of his principal at the same time that he took up the note upon which he was surety. There was no contemplation of insolvency, or design to prefer a creditor, with intent to hinder, delay or defraud creditors as contemplated by said sections.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b286-7\">These two sections contained substantially the same provisions against sales and transfers by insolvent debtors as those contained in the sections as amended, and the courts have uniformly held that a creditor may secure himself when, in doing so, he deals with an eye single to his own interest.

P., 480, cited by counsel for plaintiff in error, sustains our contention, for in that case the court gave the grantee a lien on the property conveyed to her, for the amount paid by her on account of her grantor\u2019s liabil-' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>ity, and held the conveyance fraudulent- only as to the amount in excess, the consideration for the conveyance being held inadequate.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b287-6\">Price, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AKT\">There are two questions presented in the record for our determination, which are:</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">1. The Atlas National Bank, having in its possession certain warehouse receipts for a stock of whiskey given it by H. F. Stothfang in pledge as collateral for a loan of money made to him by the bank, could the pledgor make another valid pledge or a transfer to Dieckmann of an interest in the same receipts, without any change of possession, as collateral security for a d\u00e9bt due him from the pledgor?</p>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">2. If the pledgor filed a deed of general assignment for the benefit of creditors within ninety days after the making of the second pledge or transfer, is such pledge or transfer void\u2019 under the provisions of section 6343, Revised Statutes?</p>\n<p id=\"b287-9\"><bracketnum>1.</bracketnum> The facts agreed upon show that H. F. Stothfang, for several years prior to the transaction involved, had been indebted to one Dibowski in the sum of one thousand dollars and accruing interest, and that on the last note for this debt, Dieckmann had become liable as surety or endorser, and when it matured Stothfang neglected payment. To avoid threatened suit Dieckmann satisfied the note of Dibowski by giving his individual note secured by a mortgage on his real estate. At the same time Dieckmann took the note of H. F. Stothfang, which contains a provision, that after the debt which he owed the Atlas National Bank was paid out of certain warehouse receipts for whiskey, which it held in pledge as security for the debt, the balance of said receipts were to be held by said Dieckmann as collateral security to his note, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>in this provision, power of public or private sale was conferred upon him. This instrument was executed and delivered on the 12th day of May, 1899, and on the 15th day of May, a copy of the above note and provision was served on the bank, with a notice that it should keep possession of the warehouse receipts pledged with it as collateral security for its claim against the pledgor (Stothfang), and that after it was fully paid, the balance of the warehouse receipts were to be turned over to Henry Dieckmann, who is one of the defendants in error. This notice and copy of the note given him were received, accepted and acted upon by the bank, and it was holding those receipts when Stothfang assigned on the 7th of August, 1899. It seems no question was raised by the assignee or any creditor as to the right or lien of the Atlas National Bank, but it is insisted that the attempted transfer or pledge to Dieckmann is invalid, because he never was in possession of the receipts, or the whiskey represented by them.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">On this branch of the case \u25a0 it may be remarked, that delivery of the property pledged is generally essential to a valid pledge, and it is equally true that to make a valid sale or transfer of any species or article of personal property, a delivery of the property sold or transferred is necessary, and to this extent the authorities cited by counsel for plaintiff in error may be approved. But it does not follow that actual or physical delivery should always accompany the sale or transfer, and this is also true as to the pledging of choses in action or other kinds of personal property. The delivery in some cases may be symbolical, such as the handing over the writing which constitutes the title to the property, just as was done in this case, to secure the Atlas Na<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>tional Bank for the money it had loaned to Stothfang. He delivered to the bank, not the one hundred and sixty-five barrels of whiskey, but the warehouse receipts for the same, which were its muniment of title and control of the property they represented. And when the pledgor desired to secure the payment of the note held against him by Dieckman, he executed and delivered to him the transfer of all interest in the receipts which would remain, after the bank\u2019s claim should be satisfied. This transfer was not strictly a pledge, but an assignment and transfer of the stated interest in the warehouse receipts; but if it is desired that we call it a pledge, as has been done by counsel, we still observe, that constructive possession in the second pledgee would be sufficient, if the intent to deliver such possession is clearly apparent. It is the application of the familiar rule, that the transfer is complete and delivery made, when the owner has done all that he can do in the premises, and has given such possession to the pledgee or transferee as the nature of the property and its situation will permit. In this case Stothfang owned a valuable equity' in the warehouse receipts held by the bank, as their sale afterwards made manifest, and it was such interest in them that could be made the subject of sale and transfer, and even pledge, and certainly Stothfang gave to Dieckmann possession of all interest in and' title to the receipts which would remain after the debt due the bank was satisfied. This was all the delivery that could then be made, and it was at least a constructive delivery, and this we think meets the demands of the law. In section 297 of Story on Bailments, the author, on the subject of pledges, says:' \u201cIt is of the essence of the contract, that there should be an actual delivery of the thing to the pledgee. Until <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>the delivery of the thing; the whole rests in an executory contract, however strong may be the engagement to deliver it, and the pledgee acquires no property in the thing. What will amount to a delivery of the thing is, in many cases, a matter of law. <em>There need not be an actual manual delivery of the thing. It is sufficient if there are any of those acts or circumstances, which, in construction of laio, are deemed sufficient to pass the possession of the property. Thus, goods at sea may be passed in pledge by a transfer of the muniments of title; as by a transfer of the bill of lading, or by a written assignment thereof. So goods in a loarehouse may be transferred by a symbolical delivery of the keys thereof </em>* *</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">In the case of <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Little, </em>2 Comst., 443, the court of appeals of New York held: \u201cPossession of the property is essential to the existence of a pledge, but the possession may be according to the nature of the subject. Where the property is not capable of manual delivery and possession (shares of stock in an incorporated company), a pledge may be created by a written transfer thereof * *</p>\n<p id=\"A6j1\">And on page 447, that court says: \u201cThere seems to be no reason why any legal or equitable interest whatever in personal property may not be pledged, pro-Added the interest can be put, by actual delivery or written transfer, into the hands or within the power of the pledgee, so as to be made available to him for the satisfaction of the debt. Goods at sea may be passed in pledge by a transfer of the muniments of title, as by written assignment of the bill of lading. <em>This is equivalent to actual possession, because it is a, delivery of the means of obtaining possession.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b290-10\">The ease of <em>Tuxworth </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>9 Pick., 347, is also in point. See also <em>Whitaker </em>v. <em>Sumner, </em>20 Pick., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>399. These are but a few of the* many decided cases to the same effect. Another view of the facts in this case may be justified. When the bank received the notice appearing in the record, it acted upon it, and in so doing became the agent of Dieckmann for the purposes specified, and its possession might be regarded as the possession of Dieckmann, and thus satisfy the legal requirement as to delivery.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\"><bracketnum>2.</bracketnum> Was the pledge or transfer void because of the provisions of section 6343, Revised Statutes, as amended in 1898? As a construction of that section is involved, it is well that it appear in this opinion. It reads:</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">\u201cEvery sale, conveyance, transfer, mortgage or assignment, whether made in trust or otherwise, by a debtor or debtors, and every judgment suffered by him or them, and act or device done or resorted to by him or them in contemplation of insolvency, or with a design to prefer one or more creditors to the exclusion in whole or in part of others, and every sale, conveyance, transfer, mortgage or assignment made or judgment suffered by a debtor or debtors, or procured by him or them to be made, in any mannerj with intent to hinder, delay or defraud creditors, shall be declared void as to creditors of such debtor or debtors, at the suit of any creditor or creditors, as hereinafter provided, and shall operate as an assignment and transfer of all the property and effects of such debtor or debtors, and shall inure to the equal benefit of all creditors of such debtor or debtors in proportion to the amount of their respective demands, including those which are unmatured.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">\u201cAnd every <em>such </em>sale, conveyance, transfer, mortgage or assignment made, and every such judgment suffered, and every such act or device done or re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>sorted to, by any debtor or debtors, in tbe event of a deed of assignment being filed within ninety (90) days after the giving or doing of such thing- or- act, shall be conclusively deemed and held to be fraudulent and shall be held to be void as to the assignee of such debtor or debtors, where upon proof shown, such debtor or debtors was or were actually insolvent at the time of the giving or doing of such act or thing, Whether he or they had knowledge of such insolvency or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">\u201cProvided, that nothing in this section contained shall-vitiate or affect any mortgage made in good faith to secure any debt or liability created simultaneously with such mortgage, if the same be filed for record in the county wherein the property is situated, or as otherwise provided by law, within three (3) days after its execution, and where upon foreclosure or taking possession of such property the mortgagee fully accounts for the proceeds of such property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">The pledge or transfer to Dieckmann was made on the 12th day of May, 1899, by H. F. Stothfang, and he filed a deed of assignment on the 7th of August o\u00ed the same year which was within ninety days after the making of the pledge or transfer. Notwithstanding this fact, and the language of section 6343, Revised Statutes, the transactions of the 12th of May are not necessarily void. There still may be valid sales, conveyances and transfers of property made, and which will not be affected although the seller or transferrer may file a deed of assignment within ninety- days thereafter. The clause of this section, and which is an important part of the amendment of the original section, provides that, \u201cevery <em>such </em>sale, conveyance, transfer * * * made by any debtor, or debtors, in the event of a deed of assignment being filed within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>ninety days after the giving or doing of such thing or. act, shall be conclusively deemed and held to be fraudulent, and shall be held to be void as to the assignee of such debtor or debtors, where upon proof shown, such debtor or debtors was or were actually insolvent at the time of the giving or doing of such act or thing, whether he or they (the debtor or debtors) had knowledge of such'insolvency or not.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">It will be seen that the word <em>\u201csuch\u201d </em>among the first words of the addition to the. original section, fills an important and determinative office in the construction of what follows it. It relates back to the preceding paragraph of the section wherein is provided what sales, transfers * * * shall be declared void as to creditors of such debtor or debtors, at the suit of any creditor or creditors; and the sales and transfers * * * which may be so declared void at the suit of the creditors, are <em>such </em>as were made in contemplation of insolvency, or with a design to prefer one or more creditors to the exclusion in whole or in part of others; and every sale, conveyance, transfer * * * with intent to hinder, delay or- defraud creditors. <em>\u201cSuch\u201d </em>sales, conveyances, transfers, etc., as are thus enumerated, shall be declared void at the suit of a creditor. And it is <em>\u201csuch\u201d </em>sales, conveyances, transfers, etc., as above enumerated that shall be conclusively deemed fraudulent and void as to the assignee, if the assignment is made within ninety days after such sale, conveyance, transfer, etc. In order to warrant any other construction, we must eliminate and wholly disregard the word <em>\u201csuch,\u201d </em>which seems to have been purposely used by the legislature and not through accident or mistake. That word brings the class of acts and things done as set out in the original, and which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>is yet the principal provision on the subject, down to the new declaration made by the amendment concerning them, and says: \u201cevery <em>such </em>sale, conveyance, transfer * * * in the event of a deed of assignment being filed within ninety days * * * shall be conclusively deemed and held to be fraudulent,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">We have no right or authority to despise or disregard this significant word, but must construe the section with it performing its legitimate function; and if such construction tends to render the amendment of 1898, somewhat unproductive of intended or desired results, it is not the fault of the court, as it is not the law-making power.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">Therefore, if the sale or conveyance or transfer was not in contemplation of insolvency; if it was not made Avith intent to hinder, delay or defraud creditors, or with a design to prefer one or more creditors to the exclusion in whole or in part of others, the transaction will stand in a suit brought by a creditor; and such sale, conveyance or transfer will also stand, although made within ninety days next preceding the filing of a deed of assignment, by the maker of the sale, conveyance or transfer. This conclusion rests upon the ground that the transactions were in good faith, and without the dishonest or fraudulent motive and intent which are the basis of an action to avoid them. The legislature in this part of the law regulating the acts of insolvent debtors and providing a mode of administering their estates, did not intend by the amendment to the section under consideration, to enact a system of bankruptcy, but rather attempted to provide a rule of proof in such cases, as is shown by the entire amendment, because the sales, conveyances and transfers that are \u201cconclusively deemed and held to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>be fraudulent,\u201d where an assignment follows within ninety days thereafter, are only <em>such </em>sales, conveyances and transfers, <em>etc:, </em>as are condemned in the main provision of the section, but proof must appear to show that \u201cthe debtor or debtors was or were actually insolvent at the time of the act done,\u201d whether he or they (the debtor or debtors) had knowledge of such insolvency or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">It seems clear, therefore, that the transfer or pledge by Stothfang to Dieckmann is not void because it was made within ninety days preceding Stothfang\u2019s assignment, but that proof was necessary to show that such transfer was made in contemplation of insolvency; or with a design to prefer one or more creditors to the exclusion in whole or in part of others; or with intent to hinder, delay or defraud creditors, inasmuch as it is <em>such </em>sales, conveyances, transfers, * * * that fall within the ninety day clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">The record in this case shows none of the foregoing facts <em>requisite </em>to avoid the pledge or transfer. It is true Stothfang was insolvent when he made the pledge to Dieckmann, but of this, the latter had no knowledge. There is no finding or fact in the record which brings the case within the section as we construe it, and as no fraud, or intent to prefer, hinder or delay, is shown, we will not presume either.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">On both questions we approve of the judgment of the circuit court and it is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b295-8\">Williams, C.
