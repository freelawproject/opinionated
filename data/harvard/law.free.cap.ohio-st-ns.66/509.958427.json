Mead, deceased, sued in the court of common pleas of Knox county to recover damages from the plaintiff in error for the death of his intestate caused, as alleged, by the negligence of the plaintiff in error. The negligence charged was that the conductor and engineer of the train were negligent in running the train without a headlight and in violation of the village ordinance at a high and dangerous rate of speed, that the bell was not rung or any notice or warning given of its approach in any way whatever; that the train was not run on schedule time, but was an extra. It is alleged that the said afternoon was very foggy, making it very dark, so that it was \u201cvery difficult if not impossible to see objects on the said railroad more than a few rods in front of the engine.\u201d The answer denied the allegations of negligence and denied specifically the passage or existence of the alleged ordinance, and charged the deceased with contributory negligence. A verdict and judgment were rendered for the administrator, which was affirmed in the circuit court, and the cause comes into this court for review.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b532-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>The facts are substantially as follows: The railway of the plaintiff in error passes through the northern part of the corporate limits of Buckeye City in an almost east and west direction, crossing the highway at right angles, the general direction of the road, however, being north and south. At the southeast corner of the crossing is Danville station. The railroad is perfectly straight east and west of the crossing for more than a mile each way. There is a descending grade from a point something over a mile east of the station. A switch extends along the south side of the main track, starting at the station and running east a distance of 1020 to 1040 feet, and a passing track, starting at the west side of the highway 100 to 150 feet north of the station, and running west about 2050 feet. This passing track was entirely clear on the day of the accident. The whistling post for the crossing is about a quarter of a mile east of the station. The west corporation line of Buckeye City was 582 feet from the west end of the platform and 603 feet from the station. The accident happened about 683 feet from the station. It happened on the 13th day of January, 1899. For many years the father of the decedent, J. H. Mead, had been station agent for the defendant company at this place. It was a part of his duty to light the switch lamps in the evening and bring them in in the morning. He was partially crippled and to assist him in the performance of his duties he purchased for his own convenience and used a \u201cspeeder\u201d or three-wheeled vehicle which could be run on the track, propelled by hand and feet. He did this without objection on the part of the company. The \u201cspeeder\u201d at the time of the accident had a brake, but the brake had been lost or broken off so that there was no way of stopping it ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>cept by the hands. The deceased at the time of the accident, was about sixteen years old and was in the employ of the company at five dollars per month as his father\u2019s assistant and night- man. His duties were to light the switch lamps in the evening and bring them in in the morning, attend to the two night trains at the station and when not in school carry the mail. Mr. Mead, the father, permitted his son, the deceased, to use the \u201cspeeder\u201d in doing his work, but cautioned him to be careful and to look out for trains when on the track. He had forbidden him to allow anyone else on it with him, but had seen him once or twice take another boy with him. It appeared in evidence that every two or three days, and sometimes oftener, extra trains ran through Danville without stopping and that one of the rules of the road provided: \u201cExtra trains may pass over the road at any time without previous notice, and foremen must always be prepared for it. Anything that interferes with the safe passage of trains at full speed' is an obstruction.\u201d At the time of the accident one J. P. McCaskey, a telegrapher out of employment, was temporarily helping Mr. Mead in the office. While Mr. Mead and Mr. McCaskey were in the office together during the afternoon, McCaskey, who Avas sitting at the instrument table, heard orders going over the wires, and turned to Mead and told him that an \u201cextra\u201d would meet No. 23 at a station east of Danville, either Brinkhaven or Baddaw Pass. Number 23 passed Danville going north at 2:52, the \u201cextra\u201d coming south (west) actually passed at Brinkhaven. Mead, who was busy at the time, paid little attention to the matter and it passed out of his mind. Neither he nor McCaskey communicated the fact of the \u201cextra\u201d being on the road to Arleigh, the deceased. Mr. Mead, the station agent, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>left the station about three o\u2019clock and went home, but before he left the deceased came in. Shortly after his father had left, the deceased took the \u201cspeeder\u201d and a boy companion, one Herbert Parrish and started out to light the switch lamps. It does not appear that Mr. Mead, the father, knew that the deceased was going\u201con the \u201cspeeder\u201d that day, nor did he, nor Mc-Caskey, nor anyone so far as the evidence discloses, inform the deceased that an \u201cextra\u201d was on the road. The boys backed up the main track to the north switch light, and having lighted it, they turned toward the station where they stopped for a moment to \u201chello\u201d to Mr. Burrows\u2019 horse to get off the track and then went on their way down the main track toward the south switch light. They sat side by side with their faces toward the south talking together and did not at any time, until just before the accident occurred, so far as known, look behind them. They both worked the handle-bars and made the \u201cspeeder\u201d go as fast as they could. The \u201cextra\u201d had no orders to stop at Danville, nor any reason to expect any. The rule of the company required each train when running after sunset or obscured by fog to display a headlight. But there was no headlight burning. The engineer testifies that a headlight would not have thrown a glare through the fog to enable parties to see that there was something coming, but there is other testimony on the subject. The train was going at full speed. There is some conflict in the testimony as to the rate of speed. The trainmen put it at twenty-five to thirty miles an hour, and plaintiff\u2019s witnesses about double that. The engine whistled, but whether it whistled for the crossing or not, or whether it gave an alarm whistle before the accident occurred is a matter of some dispute. It does not appear that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>boy heard the whistle. McCaskey, being in the station, heard the whistle and running out, called to the boys as loud as he could. They were then some fifty feet beyond the west side of the crossing. Failing to attract their attention he stood upon the corner of the platform and tried to give the engineer a signal to make him stop the train or whistle. The engine was then right up to him. The target was white which indicated there were no orders there for the train and no occasion to stop and the road was clear. As the engineer passed he saw McCaskey give a signal. He did not understand it, and turned for an instant to look again at the target and then at once turned his face down the track, and at the same instant the fireman saw the boys at the distance of one and one-half telegraph poles ahead of the train. Th\u00e9 boys were facing south then with their backs to the train. The engineer claims to have given the alarm whistle at this time, applied the air brakes to the engine, gave a signal for the brakes, reversed his engine and did everything in his power to stop the train. The conductor and the two brakemen were in the caboose and at the whistle for brakes they ran out and set them as fast as they could. Parrish, the boy who accompanied the deceased, says that the first he knew of the danger was the rumbling of the train. They both looked back, but the train was close upon them. The train1 men say that immediately upon blowing the alarm whistle the boys turned and looked back. Parrish, sitting on the left side, succeeded in getting off, but the deceased fell back upon the track and was instantly killed. A witness who was at the station had seen the boys come down the track on the \u201cspeeder.\u201d He heard the whistle for the station as he was getting on his wagon and drove across the track, and called to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>the boys as loud as he could and failed to get their attention. They were then a telegraph pole and a half from the crossing.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b536-5\">The existence of the alleged ordinance of Buckeye City, prohibiting the running of cars through its corporate limits at a speed exceeding eight miles an hour, was distinctly put in issue by the pleadings. On the trial the plaintiff called as a witness the mayor of Buckeye City to prove that he had given some notice to the company as to the speed of trains through the corporation. The defendant objected and the court ruled that the plaintiff should first prove the ordinance if there was one. Thereupon the witness produced the ordinance book containing the record of the supposed ordinance. Objection was made for the reason that the book was not the minutes of the proceedings of the council, nor did the record show that the supposed ordinance had ever been signed by the mayor. Thereupon the former mayor was called and a piece of paper handed to him, signed by himself and, and he says, by the city clerk, both in the presence of the council. He says it was passed one evening and posted the next day. The paper was not at that time offered in evidence, but thereupon the plaintiff again offered the book of ordinances and was permitted to read therefrom the ordinance as it appeared therein, to which ruling the defendant \u00e9xcepted. The record did not show that the ordinance had ever been signed by the mayor, nor that it had been published. Thereupon counsel for the defendant moved that it be stricken from the record for those reasons and because the ordinance was not evidence of the passage of an ordinance which could only be proved by the minutes of the proceedings of council. The motion was overruled and the defendant excepted. Later in the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>the plaintiff offered the original piece of paper on which the ordinance was written, signed by the mayor and the clerk, which had been identified by the witness. Thereupon the paper was admitted in evidence, to which the defendant excepted. The minutes of the council were not produced or offered. The defendant asked the court to charge the jury as follows: \u201cThat there having been testimony adduced tending to show that the defendant\u2019s station agent at Dan-ville station, James Mead, was guilty of negligence that contributed to the death of his son, Arleigh J. Mead, the court charges you that the plaintiff cannot recover in this case on account or by reason of any negligence on the part of the said James Mead,\u201d which the court refused to give, and the defendant excepted. But the court upon that subject, charged the jury as follows, at the request of the plaintiff: \u201cIf the jury find negligence of the defendant, its agents and servants, and also that there was negligence of the said, J. H. Mead as agent and servant of the defendant, the fact of such negligence of said J. H. Mead, which, combined with the negligence of other agents and servants of the company, caused the injury, would not prevent recovery if such negligence of the defendant, its agents and servants, was the proximate cause of said injury, and said Arleigh J. Mead was not guilty of negligence contributing directly to his injury.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AXB\">And the court also said to the jury upon that subject :. \u201cIn actions of this kind, gentlemen of the jury, the administrator is a mere nominal party, having no interest in the case for himself or his estate he represents, as such actions are for the exclusive benefit of the beneficiaries named in the section of the statute that I referred to at the beginning of this charge. In arriving at the total amount of damages in the case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>the jury should consider the pecuniary injury to each separate beneficiary, but the verdict should be for a gross sum not exceeding ten thousand dollars. * * * What has each separate beneficiary lost in money in the death of Arleigh J. Mead, will be your inquiry. First, determine the value of his life to the father; next, the value of his life to his mother, and then to each of the seven sisters, and after you have found the value of his life to them all you will return your verdict for the aggregate sum. In considering what each beneficiary is entitled to recover you are to consider the age, the health and the ability of the deceased to perform labor and earn money. * * * The health and circumstances of the parents and the disposition and good will of the deceased to the beneficiaries as likely to result in gifts or inheritances. * * The defendant also asked the court to charge the jury in that connection, as follows: \u201cThe plaintiff is not entitled to recover in this action for any pecuniary loss suffered by James H. Mead, the father of Arleigh J. Mead, on account of the death of the said son, if the jury shall find that the said James H. Mead was guilty of negligence directly contributing to the death of his son.\u201d This was refused and the defendant excepted. The defendant also asked the court to charge the jury as follows:' \u201c1. That the character of Arleigh J. Mead\u2019s employment considered, and the means which he used at the time of the accident to reach the point at which he intended placing the switch light, and the other facts and circumstances surrounding the transaction considered; that the employes of the defendant upon and in charge of and in the management of the train, which caused his death, were not obliged to regulate the speed of said train with reference\u201d to the possibility of injury to said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>Arleigh J. Mead, provided said employes in the exercise of proper care and caution in the management and running of said train to accomplish the purpose of their employment used all proper care and diligence to avoid said accident after they became aware of the presence of said Arleigh J. Mead upon said railroad track.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b539-6\">\u201c4. It is alleged in the amended petition that the afternoon or evening upon which the accident occurred was very foggy, making it very dark so that it was very difficult if not impossible to see objects on the railroad more than a few rods in front of the engine. If you find such to be the fact and that the deceased, Arleigh J. Mead, took the \u2018speeder\u2019 out upon the main track and chose that means of travel for no reason connected with his employment other than his own convenience, and after lighting the north switch light returned to the station and passed with the \u2018speeder\u2019 down the main track to light the south switch light, taking with him a companion, in violation of the order of his superior, the station agent, said James Mead; and if you shall find that from the street crossing adjoining the station there was a side track connected at that point with said main track which led directly to the south switch where the second light was to be placed, and that the said Arleigh J. Mead could have easily used the said side track with the \u2018speeder\u2019 for reaching the point where the light was to be placed; and if you shall find that by so doing he would have been in a position of safety from passing trains, and that instead of so doing he chose to so go down the main track without keeping any lookout behind him or using other precautions to insure his own safety from passing trains, then I charge you that such conduct was negligence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>upon the part of said Arleigh J. Mead, and such negligence the court charges you as will prevent the plaintiff from recovering in this case unless they, the jury, shall further find that the defendant\u2019s agents and employes upon and in the management of the said train that caused the accident, could have avoided said accident after they became aware of the presence of the said Arleigh J. Mead upon said track.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b540-5\">These requests were refused and the defendant excepted. The court charged the jury as follows: \u201cEvidence has been offered in this case on the jmrt of the plaintiff tending to show that the defendant neglected and failed to sound the whistle of the locomotive for the public crossing, and failed to ring the bell as provided by law on approaching and passing the public crossing a short distance from the point where the deceased met his death. Whether the bell was rung or the whistle sounded or both, is a question for you to determine from a consideration of all the evidence offered, and your conclusions on this subject would be one of the elements that you are to consider in determining whether the defendant was guilty of negligence that, produced, in whole or in part, the death of the deceased. In this connection I will only add that it was the duty of the company to make and enforce reasonable rules and regulations to guard against danger at public road or street crossings and in dangerous places, and that the deceased, while in the employment of the company, and when at 'or near a public street crossing, had a right to expect the performance of that duty.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b540-6\">And also as follows: \u201cA railroad track is commonly a place of danger. Whoever undertakes to walk along a railroad track or to travel thereon with a \u2018speeder\u2019 or other means of locomotion must take <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>such precautions as to ascertain the presence of danger as the ordinarily prudent person would take under like circumstances.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b541-6\">\u201c The deceased, Arleigh J. Mead, on going on the defendant\u2019s track, was bound to use all reasonable precautions to detect the presence or approach of danger from passing trains. He was bound to know that the defendant might run a train over its road at that point at any time; and ordinary care would require him to look and listen for the approach of trains; and to continuously keep alive to the approach and presence of danger from passing trains while on the defendant\u2019s track, unless lulled into a feeling of security by the failure of the defendant\u2019s employes in charge of its train to observe the statutory regulations and rules of the company in the matter of the running and management of the train at the time and place of the accident, and under the circumtances shown by the evidence.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b541-7\">The court also charged the jury as follows with respect to the ordinance:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b541-8\">\u201cEvidence has been offered tending to show that some time prior to the accident the village of Buckeye City had passed an ordinance limiting the speed of trains through the corporate limits, which it had a right to do under the statutes. The issue is made in the pleadings that this ordinance is not a valid ordinance; but the court is of the opinion that the issue is not material in the case. It does not depend on the fact whether the ordinance is valid or not. If the village council have passed an ordinance, or attempted to pass an ordinance which they supposed was valid, and notice of its passage had been communicated to the railroad authorities, and they had acted upon the assumption that the ordinance was valid, and had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>regulated the speed of their trains-accordingly, and also if knowledge of the passage of the ordinance had come to the deceased, it would be, for the purposes of this case, equivalent to a valid ordinance; and the deceased would have a right to presume that the company would conform to such regulation; and if he acted in accordance with such presumption, in the absence of knowledge of the fact that the railroad company had exceeded such limit in running its trains, it would not, of itself be an act of negligence on the part of the deceased. But if, on the other hand, the village had passed a valid ordinance, or had attempted to pass an ordinance without conforming to the requirements of the statute, and the provisions of the ordinance had been ignored by the company, and they had exceeded the limits prescribed by the ordinance in running trains through the village, and this fact had come to the knowledge of the deceased, the mere fact that the ordinance had been passed would not give the deceased a right to assume that the company, at the time of the accident, would regulate the speed of its train in conformity to the ordinance. Running a train in violation of an ordinance limiting the speed of trains is not, of itself, negligence on the part of the railroad company. After all, gentlemen of the jury, it is a mere circumstance for the jury to take into consideration, in connection with all the other facts and circumstances, in determining whether the defendant was negligent in the running of its train in the manner in which you find the evidence shows it was run at the time and place of the accident; and also in determining whether the deceased was guilty of negligence that contributed to cause his death.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b542-5\">Upon the trial several of the rules of the company were given in evidence. After the parties had rested, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>after the jury had risen to their feet and some of them had left the jury box, but before any of them had retired to their room, counsel for the plaintiff requested that the book of rules of the defendant, which had been referred to, and offered during the progress of the trial, be sent to the jury to be used by them during their deliberations. This was objected to for the reason that only a small portion of the book had been offered in evidence, the plaintiff claiming that the whole book had been offered. The court said that only certain rules or parts of the book had been offered in evidence, and instructed the jury as follows: \u201cOf course, the jury will understand that only such rules as have been offered in evidence and read to the jury during the trial will be considered by them.\u201d Thereupon the jury retired to their room. The book of rules was subsequently sent to them and was in their possession during the time of their deliberations.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b543-6\"><em>Messrs.

Nearly all of them result from a misconception of the relation of the deceased to the plaintiff in error. That he was an employe of the railway company is not disputed; but at the time of the accident his position and his conduct were not within the scope of his duty. He was on the main track with the speeder for his own convenience and under circumstances which made his presence there uncalled for and dangerous in the extreme. Such acquiescence in the occasional use of the speeder by the deceased and his father, as may be implied in this case, at best, amounts to no more than a permission for that purpose, and constituted the deceased a bare licensee. The company did not object to the use of the speeder, if it knew of it, nor did it offer any inducement or invitation therefor. 2 Thompson Negligence (2 ed.)j Secs. 1722, 1723. The deceased took the license with its concomitant perils. The acquiescence in th'e use of the track with a speeder did not involvq an undertaking on the part of the company to modify its rights as to the user of its own property; nor could it change its obligations to the public as a common carrier of passengers and freight. The trial court in this case, not without some warrant of authority it must be admitted, took the view, and so instructed the jury, that it was the duty of the railway company to exercise reasonable care, not only to avoid injury to the deceased after it discovered him upon the track, but that it was its duty to keep a careful lookout to discover and avoid injury to any person who might happen to be on its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>track at that place and at that time, and that this duty was implied in the license to the deceased and his father. It was in this view, apparently, that the court refused to give to the jury the defendant\u2019s first request to charge, and instructed the jury instead that the defendant \u201chad a right to run its cars at the time and place of the accident at any speed and in any manner 'consistent with safety which was necessary in the conduct of its business in the usual and ordinary manner, taking into consideration, however, all circumstances surrounding the locality, and having a due regard to the safety of persons who might be upon its tracks. It was required to use ordinary care in running its train, having due regard to the rights of others.\u201d Such a conception of the law is opposed to reason because a bare licensee must know that his license is subject to all the risks incident to the use of the track by the company, in the same manner in which it was used at the time the license was granted, and that the company assumes no new obligation or duty toward him. Therefore, the company owed him no duty of active vigilance to especially look out for and protect him. <em>Railway Co. </em>v. <em>Aller, </em>64 Ohio St., 192; 3 Elliott on Railroads, Sec. 1250. It is believed that it is also contrary to the weight of authority. 3 Elliott on Railroads, Secs. 1250, 1251; 2 Thompson Negligence (2 ed.), Secs. 1709, 1711, 1712, 1723, 1724; <em>Railway Co. </em>v. <em>Vittitoe\u2019s Admr. </em>(Ky.), 41 S. W. Rep., 269. It may be added here, that the rule is substantially the same as to trespassers and mere licensees, that is, licensees without invitation or inducement. An employe who goes upon the track or elsewhere upon the company\u2019s premises not in the line or discharge of his duty, and without any invitation, express or implied, is at most <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>a mere licensee to whom the company owes no duty to keep such place safe. 3 Elliott on Railroads, Sec. 1251, and cases cited; 1303 and cases cited; <em>Railway Co. </em>v. <em>Marsh, </em>63 Ohio St., 236; <em>Baker, Admr., </em>v. <em>Railway Co., </em>95 Iowa, 163; <em>Railroad Co. </em>v. <em>McKnight, </em>16 Ill. App., 596; 1 Thompson on Negligence (2 ed.), Secs. 945, 946.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">The doctrine of <em>Harriman </em>v. <em>Railway Co., </em>45 Ohio St., 11, does not apply here, because there is in this case no pretense of acquiescence in the public use of the railway track in the way in which it was used by the deceased, nor was there any invitation or inducement held out to the deceased to so use it. There Avas at most only a failure to object to such user. We cannot think, therefore, that the trial court was right in instructing the jury as it did in this regard, and in refusing to instruct as requested in the defendant\u2019s first request.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">In this connection we will consider the instructions of the court to the jury in regard to signals. Seemingly having in mind the erroneous\u2019 theory criticised <em>above, </em>the trial court called the attention of the jury to the fact that evidence had been introduced by the plaintiff tending to show that the defendant had neglected and failed to give the statutory signals required o\u00f1 approaching and passing a public cross-' ing, and the jury Avere instructed that it was for them to determine, from the evidence, whether such signals were given or not, and that their conclusion on that subject would be one of the elements which they should consider in determining whether the defendant was guilty of negligence that produced, in whole or in part, the death of the deceased; and further, that the deceased was bound to use reasonable precautions to detect the approach of trains, and was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>bound to know that the defendant might run a train over the road at that point at any time, \u201cunless lulled into a feeling of security by the failure of the defendant\u2019s employes, in charge of its train, to observe the statutory regulations and rules of the company in the matter of running and management of the train, at the time and place of the accident and under the circumstances shown by the evidence.\u201d It was also charged that the deceased, while in the employment of the company, and when at or near a public street crossing, <em>had a right to expect </em>the performance of that duty. The accident did not happen at or near the crossing, but more than six hundred feet west of it, and not while the deceased was crossing the track, but while he was traveling longitudinally upon it. Independently of the theory of liability to a bare licensee, Avhich we have already discussed, this raises the question whether the statutory duty to give signals when approaching a crossing, inures to the benefit of persons on the track and not at a crossing. The statute obviously is not for the protection of 'persons, who are not crossing the track or about to do so; for not only is the whistle to be sounded before reaching the crossing, but the bell is to be continuously rung until the crossing is passed. The signals are not required at any other time. This* is the construction which has been adopted in several jurisdictions Avhere the question has arisen. It Avas fully considered and distinctly decided in <em>Railroad Co. </em>v. <em>Depew, </em>40 Ohio St., 121, 127-129. Also in the following cases: <em>O\u2019Donnell </em>v. <em>Railroad Co., </em>6 R. I., 211; <em>Harty, Admr., </em>v. <em>Railroad Co., </em>42 N. Y., 468; <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Railroad Co., </em>135 Ill., 491; <em>Railroad Co. </em>v. <em>McKnight, </em>16 Ill. App., 596; <em>Rohback </em>v. <em>Railroad Co., </em>43 Mo., 187; <em>Toomey </em>v. <em>Railroad Co., </em>86 Cal., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>374; <em>Hale </em>v. <em>Railroad Co., </em>34 S. C., 292; <em>Railway Co. </em>v. <em>Gravitt, </em>93 Ga., 369; 2 Thompson on Negligence, (2 ed.), Sec. 1707. There being no legal duty, in that regard, due from the defendant to the deceased, this' instruction to the jury was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">Up to this point, we have endeavored to consider the questions of law which were under review without complicating them with the subject of contributory negligence. It becomes necessary now to look at that phase of the case. The cpurt refused to instruct the jury as requested in the defendant\u2019s fourth request. This instruction was sound and ought to have been given. If it were found to be true that the deceased chose to travel with the speeder upon the main track for no reason connected with his employment, other than his convenience; that he rode down the main track with a companion, on the speeder, in violation of the order of his superior, the station agent; that from the station to the south switch light there was a \u201cpassing track\u201d on which he could have placed the speeder and easily and with absolute safety have reached his destination, and that instead of doing so he chose to go down the main track, without keeping' any lookout behind him, there can be no doubt that he was guilty of negligence which proximately contributed to his own injury, unless the defendant could have avoided the injury after discovering the deceased upon the track. The authorities sustaining this proposition are so numerous that it would be prae: tically impossible to cite them all here. We content ourselves with citing a few pertinent cases and leading text writers, with the cases collected and cited by them: 3 Elliott on Eailroads, Sec. 1303, and cases cited in notes thereto; 2 Thompson on Negligence, (2 ed.), Secs. 1734, 1738, 1747, 1748 and 1774, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>eases cited in notes thereto; <em>Ream </em>v. <em>Railroad Co., </em>49 Ind., 93; <em>Railroad Co. </em>v. <em>Depew, </em>40 Ohio St., 121; <em>Burling, Admx., </em>v. <em>Railroad Co., </em>85 Ill., 18. It will he seen from these authorities that the instruction, as requested, states the law more strongly against the company than was necessary. It makes the qualification that \u201cunless the jury shall further find that the defendant\u2019s agents and employes * * * could have avoided said accident after they became aware of the presence of the said Arleigh J. Mead, upon said' track.\u201d Strictly speaking, the law would require the defendant, after discovering the deceased to be upon the track, to use reasonable care under the circumstances to avoid the accident, not absolutely to avoid it; but this being an error against the party asking the instruction, it should not have been refused for that reason. Besides, the instruction which was asked, specifically challenged the attention of the jury to some very important circumstances affecting the claim of contributory negligence, and the error of refusing this is nowhere cured in the charge as given.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">Again, the defendant asked the court to charge the jury that the plaintiff could not recover on account of, or by reason of, any negligence on the part of James H. Mead, the father of the deceased, at that time the agent of the defendant; and also that plaintiff could not recover for any pecuniary loss suffered by the father of deceased, on account of the death of his son, if the jury should find that the father was guilty of negligence directly contributing to the death of his- son. These requests were refused. There was, it is true, no issue in the pleadings upon this subject; but the court did charge the jury that \u201cin arriving at the total amount of damages in the case, the jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>should consider the pecuniary injury to each separate beneficiary, but the verdict should be for a gross sum not exceeding ten thousand dollars,\u201d and that \u201cwhat has each separate beneficiary lost in money in the death of Arleigh J. Mead, will be your inquiry.. First determine the value of his life <em>to the father, </em>next the value of his life to his mother,\u201d etc. Having done this and having given the jury the plaintiff\u2019s requests, numbered 13 and 19, the defendant\u2019s request that the jury should also be instructed that the plaintiff would not be entitled to recover for any pecuniary loss of the father, if the jury should find that the father was, guilty of negligence directly contributing to the death of the son, could not properly be refused. <em>Wolf, Admr., </em>v. <em>Railway Co., </em>55 Ohio St., 517.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">The trial court and the counsel for the defendant in error seem to have entertained the view that the question raised concerning the ordinance of Buckeye City, related to the validity and effect of the ordinance; but the issue in the pleadings was as to the legal passage and existence of the ordinance. The evidence to show the existence of the ordinance was clearly incompetent and insufficient, and the charge of the court did not cure the error of admitting it. It left the ordinance with the jury, as if it were a proven fact, instructing them that it was a circumstance to be taken into consideration, \u201cin connection Avith all other facts and circumstances, in determining whether the defendant was negligent in the running of the train in the manner in which you find the evidence shows it was run at the time and place of the accident; and also in determining whether the deceased was guilty of negligence that contributed to cause his death.\u201d Nothing more needs to be said on that subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>Another manifest error was the sending of the hook of rules to the jury to be used by them in their deliberations, only a few of the rules having been offered in evidence. Upon this record we would not reverse for that error, because it does not clearly appear that the company was prejudiced thereby; but we mention it in order that we may not seem to have approved it, and for the guidance of the trial court hereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">The judgments of the circuit court and the court of common pleas are</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b566-7\">Burket, Spear, Shaudk and Price, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
