It is averred in the answer of the Japan Company that the Warehouse Company commenced that action upon the advice and procurement, and with the assistance, of the state, that the Warehouse Company claimed title under its lease from the state, which title was denied, and title averred to be in the defendants in that case. In the final judgment the court found in that case that the plaintiff, the Warehouse Company, \u201cis not entitled to the possession of the premises, but that the defendant is seized in fee simple thereof, and entitled to retain possession thereof.\u201d The judgment is \u201cthat the plaintiff\u2019s petition be dismissed, that the title of the defendant to said premises be quieted against the claim of the plaintiff to any interest or estate therein, that the plaintiff be enjoined perpetually and forever restrained from disturbing or interfering with the defendant\u2019s possession thereof.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b204-4\">On the trial of the case at bar the Japan Company offered in evidence an appropriation by the general assembly May 5, 1869, as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b204-5\">\u201cTo pay attorneys\u2019 fees and incidental expenses of the board of public works, to include fees and costs, of maintaining title of the state to the lands in the city of Cincinnati which have been leased to Thomas Brown and Adolph Wood, two thousand dollars.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Ak2\">The reports of the board of public works as to the progress of the action were also introduced in evidence, the one for 1881 showing that the case had been decided adverse to the state.

Pleads the record in a cause in the superior court of Cincinnati entitled The Cincinnati Elevator and Warehouse Company v. E. Jefferson Buckinham and Richard Mathers* partners as Buckingham &amp; Mathers, in which it was averred that the judgment of the court was against the plaintiff and in favor of Buckingham and Mathers. That the plaintiff in that action was the lessee of the state of Ohio and that the action was brought with the assistance of the state of Ohio and under its advice and procurement, and that' the judgment in that cause is still in full force and effect, and that the plaintiff herein by reason of the judgment aforesaid is estopped from prosecuting this action.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b206-7\">3. The third defense relied upon is uninterrupted possession for a period of more than twenty-one years.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b206-8\">To this answer the state filed a reply denying each and every allegation of the second defense except that the Cincinnati Elevator and Warehouse Company was the lessee of the state of Ohio. It further replies and says that if there was any such judgment rendered against the Cincinnati Elevator and Warehouse Company, the same is not binding upon the state of Ohio because it was not a party to said action, and the action was begun without its knowledge and it was not represented by counsel or in any way a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>party to the record, and denies that the same is any adjudication of the title of the state of Ohio in the premises, or that the record therein does in any way estop the plaintiff in this action.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b207-6\">The balance of the reply is in the nature of a demurrer challenging the answer as not sufficient in law to constitute a defense to the petition.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b207-7\">The state of Ohio prosecutes error to this court seeking the reversal of the judgment of affirmance by the circuit court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b207-8\">Is statute unconstitutional under which evidence was offered?</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b207-9\">In holding that Sec. 218-223 of the Revised Statutes is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b207-10\">Upon the trial of this cause in the court below, the plaintiff in error offered in evidence certain maps, plats, findings and parts of public documents of the canal commission, the board of public works and chief engineer, all of which were duly certified, and which the court refused to be admitted as evidence for the state. To the ruling of the court exceptions were noted by the state.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b207-11\">This evidence was introduced by virtue of Sec. 218-223, Bates\u2019 Annotated Revised Statutes. The court in passing upon the admissibility of the evidence thus offered by the state, held that that section was unconstitutional and hence refused to permit the evidence to be introduced.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b207-12\">In this we claim that the trial court erred.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b207-13\">The court\u2019s objection to the statute was that the statute created a <em>prima facie </em>case for the plaintiff, by permitting the maps and plats to be thus introduced.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b207-14\">We did not think that any objection could be made to this character of testimony, if properly certified. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>The holding of the courts have been uniform on that question.

They all depend upon the same general proposition for their validity, viz.: that rules of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>evidence are not rules of property ; and that the legislature has full control over all such rules, and violates, no constitutional provision in enacting them, if in so doing it merely defines a <em>prima facie </em>case, or changes the burden of proof from one party to the other. <em>Hand </em>v. <em>Ballou, </em>12 N.

(10 Tenn.), 259.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b211-6\">This testimony was permitted by tbe court to be introduced upon the theory, that, as tbe second defense in tbe answer sets forth, tbe action of tbe <em>Cincinnati Elevator and Warehouse Company </em>v. <em>Buckingham &amp; Mathers, </em>was in fact carried on and prosecuted \u2014 \u201cupon tbe advice and procurement and with tbe assistance of tbe plaintiff\u2019s herein,\u201d and having been so carried on and prosecuted, it became and was in law <em>an action by the state of Ohio.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b211-7\">It will be observed that tbe evidence shows: (a) Tbe State of Ohio was not a party to said action, (b ) The judgment rendered therein was against tbe Cincinnati Elevator and Warehouse Company, and not against tbe state of Ohio. (c ) Tbe Cincinnati Elevator and Warehouse Company was only tbe lessee of tbe state of Ohio, and tbe judgment rendered was merely tbe adjudication of its- rights as lessee, and not an adjudication of tbe interests, rights and title of tbe state.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b211-8\">It was not possible to sue tbe state of Ohio without its consent first having been given. <em>Board of Liquidation </em>v. <em>McComb, </em>92 U.

If a judgment could not be rendered against a state without its consent having been given to be sued, tbe state could not be affected by a judgment rendered against tbe state\u2019s lessee.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b212-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>A state cannot be bound by a judgment rendered against its own officers. <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Gray, </em>83 U. S. (16 Wall.), 203; <em>Carr </em>v. <em>United States, </em>98 U. S., 433.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b212-5\">It is not necessary to cite authorities to show that the privileges of the state and its rights as a sovereign, are as great as are those' of the general government secured to itself.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b212-6\">How could it then be dispossessed of its interest in real estate by a judgment against its lessee?</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b212-7\">It will be observed by reading the judgment of the Cincinnati superior court in <em>Canal Elevator Co. </em>v. <em>Buckingham et al., </em>that the judgment is only operative upon the plaintiff and the state of Ohio cannot by any reasoning be made to mean the same person. If the judgment of the court is against John Doe individually, it cannot be extended to Richard Roe unless he claims under Doe. <em>State </em>v. <em>Gas Light &amp; Coke Co., </em>18 Ohio St., 262.</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b212-8\">The Canal Elevator and Warehouse Company in the case above mentioned was the tenant of the state by virtue of the powers vested in the board of public works of the state to execute such leases, but the power to lease did not confer the power to sell or give away the premises in question. This was a board of limited powers. They had no right or authority to enter the appearance of the state of Ohio in any action. We cannot see how by any fiction a judgmentrecovered against the lessee could even be construed to be a judgment against the board of public works, let alone that it would be a judgment, and effectual as a bar, against the state of Ohio.</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b212-9\">If the defendant, the Cincinnati Tin &amp; Japan Company, claimed through Buckingham and Mather, or in other words, if they were a link in their chain of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>title, the judgment rendered in that case, <em>if against the state, or its grantors, </em>might be used by the defendant in proving its ownership to the land in question.</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b213-6\">But that is not the question here. The objection is twofold: (a) To using the evidence upon which the judgment was rendered. In presenting this objection we waive for the moment the fact that the state of Ohio, or its grantors, was not a party to that cause. But suppose they were. It could only be the record, viz. .: <em>the judgment, </em>that could avail the defendant, the Cincinnati Tin &amp; Japan Company, <em>and not the evidence </em>upon which the judgment was based. The judgment concludes the parties and privies. But here is a privy to that judgment refusing to be satisfied with it, and going back of it introduces the evidence again, as much as to say, that it would again submit to the jury in this cause the evidence in the trial thirty years before, and have them return a new verdict thereon, (b) The further objection we make to this class of testimony is that the judgment is no bar to an action instituted <em>by the state of Ohio </em>for the same premises. Not being able to use the same as a bar or estoppel, the evidence was improper for any purpose. It would not even avail as between individuals, and a <em>fortiori, </em>cannot avail as against the state. <em>Bennett </em>v. <em>Leach, </em>25 Hun (N.

Samuel Bachtell, assistant engineer of the public works of the state of Ohio, , to the effect that he was familiar Avith the records- of the board, and that all the existing records pertaining to the construction and maintenance of the Miami and Erie canal were kept in the custody of the board; that he had made a search for any plat or plan qf the portion of the canal Avithin the city of Cincinnati known as \u201cLockport Basin,\u201d but had found no plat earlier than one made in the year 1851, except copies of the plats for the United States Bank subdivision certified from the records of Hamilton county. - \u2022 . .\"</p>\n<p data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b215-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>The basin was constructed immediately after the construction of the canal at that point, and was in use as early as 1832. The state not only has no record of appropriation, but there is nothing of any sort showing any plan for a basin or any specifications or contract for the same, or any illusion of any sort to such a basin in the records of the board of public works\u2019or canal commissioners prior to the year 1851; so that the state\u2019s claim of an appropriation of the property, leaving out of view the finding of the canal commission excluded from the testimony, rests upon the solitary testimony of the two navigators aforesaid, viz.: that they had seen canal boats pass through the basin, had seen them landed and lying at the warehouses abutting upon it, and had seen them winded, or turned, in the basin. It is extremely doubtful if those facts alone constitute a <em>prima facie </em>case of appropriation by the state. <em>Smith </em>v. State, 59 Ohio St., 278; <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Weisenberger, </em>61 Ohio St., 561.</p>\n<p data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b215-6\">When we take the scanty testimony offered by the state of the user and occupation in connection with the testimony offered by defendant, it will appear that the same conclusion must follow as that which was arrived at by this court in the Smith and Weisenberger cases, and for the same reason. While it is true that boats may have turned in this basin when it existed, it is also true that there was no necessity for the basin for that purpose, for boats are now daily turned at that part of the canal.</p>\n<p data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b215-7\">The only commission whose plats and findings are made evidence <em>per se </em>by Sec. 218-223, Rev. Stat., was the original commission appointed under the act of 1888; the language making such documents evidence is limited in terms to the findings, maps, plats <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>and surveys of that commission, and has never by any subsequent statute been extended to those of any other commission. The documents offered in evidence here were none of them made under the authority of that commission, as appears by their dates; for the authority of that commission ceased in 1890, and the earliest of these documents bears date in 1896. Therefore, Section 218-223 does not warrant the admission of any of them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b216-4\">Section 79, Revised Statutes, precludes giving Section 218-223, retrospective operation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b216-5\">The court below held, and we submit correctly, that' assuming that Sec. 218-223, Rev. Stat., was applicable to the plats and findings of subsequently created commissions, and were intended to make documents such as these admissible in evidence at all, it could not be construed, in view of Sec. 79, Rev. Stat., as intending that they should be received in evidence with reference to a cause of action existing on April 12, 1889, when this provision giving evidential effect to proceedings of the canal commission was first introduced into the statutes.</p>\n<p data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b216-6\">It can not be denied that this provision relates at least to the <em>remedy. </em>We think, for reasons subsequently to be stated, that it goes farther and affects the <em>right </em>as well; but for the purpose of the question immediately under consideration this contention need not be. urged. Counsel for the state justify their argument as to the admissibility of these documents as evidence upon the assumption that the remedy only is affected, and that such effect does not transcend the power of the legislature. Were this true it would not follow that the legislature intended that existing causes of action should be remedied under this new <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>rule.' The act in question, 86 O. L., 270-274, contains no clause explicitly declaring; that it shall control existing causes of action. It does indeed say that \u2018'\u2018this act shall take effect and be in full force from and after its passage;\u201d but it has been repeatedly held by this court that this declaration is not sufficient to give a remedial act a retrospective operation, and that the intent to give it such effect must appear either explicitly, as in the act of April 25, 1898, amending Sec. 6710, 93 O. L., 255, or by implicit expression so plain and forcible that he who runs may read. <em>State </em>v. <em>Rabbitts, </em>46 Ohio St., 178; <em>Insurance Co. </em>v. <em>Myers, </em>59 Ohio St., 332; <em>Meader </em>v. <em>Blymer, </em>60 Ohio St., 621. And this is true whether the changes introduced by the new law be in the form of an amendment or a supplement to existing statutes, as in the cases cited above, or a change of the common law, as was held in <em>Railway Co. </em>v. <em>Hedges, </em>63 Ohio St., 339.</p>\n<p data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b217-6\">Section 218-223, Rev. Stat., if applicable, is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b217-7\">If Section 218-223, Rev. Stat., can be construed as commanding or authorizing the admission in evidence of the documents in question offered by the state, then we submit that to that extent it.infringes upon rights secured and guarantees given to the defendant by both state and federal constitutions.</p>\n<p data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b217-8\">We beg leave to call attention to a cardinal rule of constitutional construction always observed, and recently most happily expressed by the Supreme Court of the United States. <em>Fairbanks </em>v. <em>United States, </em>181 U.

Our constitution provides that all laws of a general nature shall have a uniform operation throughout the state. It provides also that corporat\u00e9 powers shall not be given by special act. This court has repeatedly held that while these provisions, left to the legislature the power to classify, yet the classification, when made, must not be whimsical or without apparent reason, but must have a fitness of application to the subject of legislation. <em>Falk, Ex parte, </em>42 Ohio St., 638; <em>Railway Co. </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>53 Ohio St., 386; <em>Cincinnati </em>v. <em>Steinkamp, </em>54 Ohio St., 284.</p>\n<p data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b218-5\">Instances of the transgression by the legislature, in adopting rules of evidence and procedure, of limits expressly imposed by the constitution or inherent in the ideas of trial by jury, equality of protection, and due process of law, are to be found in the following cases: <em>Dupy </em>v. <em>Wickwire, </em>1 D.

If the use were not exclusive, but merely incidental \u00a9r constructive, or in common with that of the .proprietor at the time the state\u2019s use began, his title would not be disturbed. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>State, </em>59 Ohio St., 278; <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Weisenberger, </em>61 Ohio St., 561; <em>State </em>v. <em>George, </em>34 Ohio St., 657.</p>\n<p data-order=\"85\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b219-7\">The defendant is confessedly in exclusive possession of the property in question. The petition, filed by the Canal Elevator and Warehouse Company, .the lesse'e of the state, shows that this exclusive possession began at least as early as 1868, thirty years. before the bringing of this action.</p>\n<p data-order=\"86\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b219-8\">The evidence offered by the defendant, if adfiiissible, at least tended to show that the state had n\u00e9ver made exclusive use of the property, and that, the flowing of canaTwater over it had been the act of the. defendant\u2019s predecessors in title for their own benefit, and not by them as a dedication to the state, or by the state as adverse to them, and consequently that the state, under the doctrine of <em>Smith </em>v. <em>State, 5</em>9 Ohio St., 278, never gained title by occupancy.!:</p>\n<p data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AXx\">According to principles as old as the common .lahV, this possession is in itself, as graphically\u2019 stated in Pollock <em>&amp; </em>Wright on Possession, pages. 22 and 23,!l\u201ca root of title.\u201d It is in itself a species of title,1; and/a perfect ground of defense until destroyed'by the showing by the plaintiff of a prior possessiori in Mmself, ora better-right to possession. L<em>udlow </em>v. <em>McBride, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>3 Ohio, 240; <em>McNeely </em>v. Langan, 22 Ohio St., 32; <em>Trustees </em>v. <em>Thoman, </em>51 Ohio St., 285.</p>\n<p data-order=\"88\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b220-5\">Thus prior to the passage of this act of 1889, the defendant\u2019s predecessors in title, being in possession of this land, by that bare fact had title to it, and this title was good, and this possession was its muniment, as against all who could not show a better title, including the state of Ohio. It was a vested right; and although it was subject to defeat by one showing a better title not barred by the statute of limitations, yet until such showing was made it was as perfect and indefeasible as any other right.</p>\n<p data-order=\"89\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b220-6\">Look now at the changes which it is claimed the act of 1889 has made. The state of Ohio, by producing the declaration of its agent that in his opinion it has title to the land, thereby introduces evidence not merely that it has title, but, being <em>prima </em>facie, of such weight as to overcome the possessory title of the defendant, and to require the defendant to show a better title. This opinion of the agent of the state is formed upon such inquiry as he may see fit to make, and consequently to omit making. The agent is not even required or authorized to rest his judgment upon sworn statements; for no authority is given him to administer an oath, and one administered by any other officer would, if taken, be purely voluntary, and not subject the witness to the penalty of perjury. <em>Hamm </em>v. <em>Wickline, </em>26 Ohio St., 81.</p>\n<p data-order=\"90\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b220-7\">We submit that if Sec. 218-223, Rev. Stat., has the effect which counsel for the state would give to it, it would attempt to accomplish the things which we have just mentioned, and for that reason it would be void as infringing upon the following provisions of the state and federal constitution. Constitution of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>Ohio, Art. 1, Sec. 1; lb., Sec. <em>2; </em>United States Const., amendment 14, Sec. 1; Constitution of Ohio, Art. 1, Sec. 19; lb., Sec. 16; Constitution of Ohio, Art. 2, Sec. 28; lb., Sec. 32, Art. 1, Sec. 5; Art. 4, Sec. 1.</p>\n<p data-order=\"91\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b221-6\">We submit that the provisions in question infringe upon these constitutional provisions because:</p>\n<p data-order=\"92\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b221-7\">1. It is retroactive.</p>\n<p data-order=\"93\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b221-8\">2. It denies the defendant in this particular class, of actions the equal protection of the laws, inasmuch as it subjects him to a burden and gives the state an advantage Avhich does not exist in any other action to recover real property.</p>\n<p data-order=\"94\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b221-9\">3. It attempts to destroy, and at least impairs, a vested right.</p>\n<p data-order=\"95\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b221-10\">4. It attempts to give the state color of title to what is private property, and this without compensation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"96\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b221-11\">5. It is an exercise of judicial power by the legislature.</p>\n<p data-order=\"97\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b221-12\">6. It confers judicial power upon appointed executive officers.</p>\n<p data-order=\"98\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b221-13\">7. It violates the right of trial by jury.</p>\n<p data-order=\"99\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b221-14\">That the act is retrospective, and retroactive in effect, is the essence of the claim made by the state. <em>Commissioners </em>v. <em>Rosche Bros., </em>50 Ohio St., 103. And it is manifest, we think, that this statute does the things which Art. 2, Sec. 28, of our constitution so defined, prohibits.</p>\n<p data-order=\"100\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b221-15\">It will be claimed by counsel for the state that as the statute but relates to admissible evidence and burden of proof, it is merely regulative of procedure, and so is remedial, and not Avithin the inhibition. It has been expressly decided in New Hampshire (see <em>Rich </em>v. <em>Flanders, </em>39 N. H., 304), that their constitutional provision forbidding retrospective legisla<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>tion throws at least the same protection over litigants in civil cases which the <em>ex post facto </em>provision of the federal constitution, Art. 1, Sec. 10, gives to persons accused of crime. Prom the very beginning the clause in the federal constitution against <em>ex post facto </em>laws has been considered as prohibiting a change, in the rules of evidence so as to receive for conviction less or different testimony than the law required when the crime was committed. <em>Calder </em>v. <em>Bull, </em>3 U. S. (3 Dall.), 386, 390. And this exposition has been again approved in the last pronouncement of the Supreme Court of the United States upon the subject. <em>Mallett </em>v. <em>North Carolina, </em>181 U. S., 589; <em>Coal Co. </em>v. <em>Rosser, </em>53 Ohio St., 12; <em>State </em>v. <em>Gardner, </em>58 Ohio St., 599.</p>\n<p data-order=\"101\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b222-4\">That it impairs vested rights and violates rights Of property is also manifest.</p>\n<p data-order=\"102\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b222-5\">It practically transfers title from the defendant to the state. The defendant has title to the property by its bare possession, but this title does not avail it because, and only because, the state is plaintiff. This title then is destroyed, the benefit of it transferred to the state, and the defendant put to proving a better title. Nor is even that sufficient. The state under the act is entitled to recover unless the defendant proves affirmatively that the. state\u2019s claim of title is false. He loses his own vested right to hold the property until one comes having a better title than he, and is given in return the empty privilege of attempting to prove facts which can be established only by witnesses long since dead. How inconsistent this is with- the rights secur\u00e9d by our constitution can be seen by a perusal not m\u00e9rely of the cases we have cited from other jurisdictions; but from the following in our o^srn. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>reports: <em>McCoy </em>v. Grandy, 3 Ohio St., 463; <em>Magruder </em>v. <em>Esmay, </em>35 Ohio St., 221; <em>State </em>v. <em>Guilbert, </em>56 Ohio St., 575.</p>\n<p data-order=\"103\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b223-6\">That the act is either an exercise of judicial power by the legislature, or is the conferring of judicial power upon appointed executive officers is, we think, clear. The opinion of the canal commission embraced in its finding which is made evidence, is not of itself and by its own weight probative of the facts it declares. The legislation which requires such conclusion to be accepted as presumptively correct in the adjudication of rights, is in fact not legislation, but arbitrary decision, judicial action, or else is the conferring upon those officials of judicial power. It clothes their action with the attributes which theretofore had pertained to courts of justices only. <em>State </em>v. <em>Guilbert, </em>56 Ohio St., 575.</p>\n<p data-order=\"104\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b223-7\">And for this reason such legislation also violates the right of trial by jury. That right, as secured by the constitution, means the right of trial by jury in like manner a.nd in like cases as at the common law. <em>Capital Traction Co. </em>v. <em>Hof, </em>174 U. S., 1; <em>Work </em>v. <em>State, </em>2 Ohio St., 296.</p>\n<p data-order=\"105\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b223-8\">The lease to Brown and Wood barred a recovery.</p>\n<p data-order=\"106\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b223-9\">A part of the evidence offered by the state consisted of a lease of the premises in controversy to Thomas Brown and Adolph Wood, dated April 23, 1868, for \u201cthe term of ninety-nine years, renewable forever upon the same terms.\u201d There is nothing in the record showing that the lease is not now in as full force and effect as it was when executed. It does appear that the lessees assigned their interest to the Canal Elevator and Warehouse Company, December 17, 1868, and .that - is the end of the .evidence on the sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>ject. We submit that the fact of this outstanding lease was sufficient ground for the judgment below. The effect of it was to show that the state had transferred the right of possession, if any she had, to the persons named as her lessees \u2014 and for that reason could not maintain an action of ejectment for the possession of the property.</p>\n<p data-order=\"107\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b224-5\">The facts conclusively establish the truth of the allegation of the answer, that the action by the Cincinnati Elevator and Warehouse Company, lessee of the state, was brought upon the advice and procurement and with the assistance of the state, and was prosecuted to final judgment by the attorneys employed, paid and controlled by, the state. The cause of action was the same as. in this; and while the parties to the record are not the same, the defendant derives title from, and is in privity with, Buckingham &amp; Mathers, defendants in the former action, and the State was the lessor of the plaintiff, as well as the moving party in the prosecution of the former action, which was prosecuted with its means, under its control, and for its benefit, in the name of the Canal Elevator and Warehouse Company.</p>\n<p data-order=\"108\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b224-6\">Under these circumstances we submit the plaintiff yas ' estopped to maintain the action below. Although the state was not named as a party to the previous action, it is nevertheless bound by the judgment. It frequently happens that parties other than those whose names appear on the record of a judgment are estopped by it. If a party causes a suit to be brought for his own benefit in the name of another it is clear that such party is bound by the result, upon the same principles that he would be bound by the result of an action in his own name.

The general rule is that to be bound by a\u2018judgment the party to be bound must have been a party or privy in blood or est\u00e1te. Here the state was neither.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">For a record to constitute a bar or <em>res adjudieata </em>against one not a party or privy, but Avho'assisted in the prosecution or defense of the action in aid of some interest of his own, the record itself must in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>some way show such assistance. <em>State of Florida </em>v. <em>State of Georgia, </em>58 U. S. (17 How.), 478.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\"><em>If, </em>however, the record is to be used merely as an estoppel <em>in pais, </em>then the advice, assistance or procurement may be shown by evidence <em>aliunde </em>the record under the usual rules of estoppel. Many cases have been cited and distinguished by counsel, but all of them fall under one or the other of the above rules, or else are controlled by local statutes or rules of decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">Actions by or against the state can be brought only by express authority of the general assembly, and the state cannot be estopped by an act of its officers, unless the state has by statute authorized such officer to act on that- behalf, and then the estoppel can be no broader than the authority. The estoppel in such cases is not so much <em>in pais </em>as by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">As the state was not a party or privy to the record, and the record fails to show that the state assisted in the case, and the general assembly not having passed any act authorizing such action, or such assistance, it follows that the state is not bound or es-topped by that record, and that the court of common pleas erred in admitting the same. Whether such error was prejudicial will be considered further along.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">The state had. the right to prove the dimensions of the berme bank and tow-path, but such proof should have been made by the original, or certified copies, of the specifications and rules adopted for the construction of the canals. An epitome prepared by the canal commission would not be competent evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-9\">Before the enactment of the canal commission statute, when the state undertook to recover canal lands from one found in possession thereof, it had to prove <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>in the first instance that the lands were formerly canal lands. Such proof showed that the state was formerly the owner in fee simple of the lands, and that fact being proven or conceded, overcame the possessory right of the defendant, and threw upon him the burden of showing that he had in some lawful manner, either by lease or purchase, acquired the lands from the state. As the statute of limitations could not run in his favor, as against the state, his continued possession could never ripen into a title, and therefore the rule that one in possession of lands can be dispossessed only by one showing a better title is not applicable, because by showing that the lands were formerly canal lands, the state shows a better title, a title that must prevail as against everybody, unless a title from the state is shown, and the burden of showing such title rests upon the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">Section 218-221, Bates\u2019 Statutes, after providing for the appointment of a canal commission, makes it the duty of such commission to \u201cproceed to survey and determine the boundaries of all lands heretofore appropriated for canal purposes, and owned by the state, the boundaries of which are not now accurately known and of record, as already surveyed, and to mark the same by proper monuments, and to make maps and plats of all said canal lands not already platted, together with the necessary description and location of all bridges, culverts and aqueducts, and shall clearly indicate and describe in their report any part of said property that in their judgment is not necessary for canal purposes, all of which is to be preserved as hereinafter provided.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">Section 218-223, Bates\u2019 Revised Statutes, is as follows : \u201cEach of said commissioners is hereby author<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>ized to issue subpoenas for, and compel the attendance of such witnesses as they, or either of them, may think necessary in fixing said boundaries, or ascertaining any fact which said commission should ascertain in the discharge of its duties; and the testimony so taken, together with said maps, plats, and field notes of such surveys, and the report of said commission as to the boundaries of the lands belonging to the state of Ohio,.with its findings in that behalf, shall be filed for preservation in the office of the board of public works; and upon any trial in any of the courts of this state, any of said findings, maps, plats, or surveys, which may in any manner relate to or having any bearing upon the subject-matter at issue, shall be taken and held to be competent <em>(prima facie) </em>evidence of the- truth of such findings, and the boundaries of said lands, and that the state of Ohio has the ownership of said land, or such an interest in it as may be therein stated; and a duly certified or sworn copy of such findings, plat, or map shall, when produced on said trial, have the same force and effect as the original from which it was taken would have under this section if produced on said trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">The court of common pleas refused to permit the findings, maps, plats and surveys so made under these sections to be introduced in evidence by the state, holding said last named section to be unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">It will be noticed that by section 218-221, the canal commission is authorized to survey and determine the boundaries of lands appropriated for canal purposes, and owned by the state. Other lands the commission has no authority to survey or determine its boundaries. So that as to each tract of land the first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>question to be determined is, whether it has ever been appropriated to canal purposes and owned by the state, that is, was it heretofore canal lands? As between the state and a person found in possession of lands which the state claims as canal lands, this question must be determined by evidence in court where each party can be heard under the rules applicable for the trial and determination of disputed facts; and upon such trial the findings, maps, plats, and surveys made by the canal commission are not competent evidence. Such findings, maps, plats, and surveys can be made only as to canal lands, and to say that because they are made, that therefore the lands are canal lands, is not sound reasoning. Such findings, maps, plats, and surveys are made without notice to the party in possession, and therefore cannot bind him even <em>prima facie. </em>Were it otherwise the commission might make findings, maps, plats and surveys of any person\u2019s land, and thereby prove that such lands were canal lands, and being canal lands, the fee simple title would be in the state; so that the power would be in the commission to divest a man of his title without notice or trial, and to vest the title in the state, at least <em>prima facie. </em>This would clearly be in conflict with that part of section nineteen of the Bill of Bights which declares that \u201cPrivate property shall ever be held inviolate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">But it is urged that the findings, maps, plats, and surveys are not conclusive, but only <em>prima facie </em>evidence of title in the state, and that the general assembly has power to prescribe the rules of evidence, and provide what shall make a <em>prima facie </em>case, and numerous authorities are cited in support of this prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>osition, among others <em>Railway Company </em>v. <em>McCann, 54 </em>Ohio St., 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">That the general assembly has power to prescribe what shall constitute a <em>prima facie </em>case must be conceded; but that power under our constitution extends only to future transactions, and as to such the statute is read into the transaction, and forms a part of it; but as to past transactions the general assembly has no power,, by a change of the rules of evidence, to add new burdens, or impose new duties. This is forcibly illustrated by comparing the cases of <em>Railway Company </em>v. <em>McCann, supra, </em>and <em>Railroad Company </em>v. <em>Kreager, </em>61 Ohio St., 312, with <em>Railroad Company </em>v. <em>Hedges, </em>63 Ohio St., 339. In the two former cases the transactions occurred after the passage of the <em>prima facie </em>statutes, and it was correctly held that those statutes were applicable to the cases; but in the latter case the transaction occurred before the passage of the <em>prima facie </em>statute, and it was held that the statute was not applicable to the case, being in effect retroactive.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">This court held in <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Hixson, </em>64 Ohio St., 39, first paragraph of the syllabus, as follows: \u201cA statute which imposes a new or additional burden, duty, obligation, or liability, as to past transactions, is retroactive, and in conflict with that part of section 28, article two of the constitution, which provides that, \u2018The general assembly shall have no power to pass retroactive laws.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">This section 218-223, attempts to make the findings, maps, plats', and surveys of the canal commission proof of the fact that the lands in question were canal lands, and to thereby relieve the state from proving that fact in the ordinary way <em>aliunde </em>such findings, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>and to impose upon the defendant the additional burden of overcoming the <em>prima facie </em>case thus made by the state. The statute therefore imposes an additional burden upon the defendant as to a past transaction, and is therefore retroactive in character and effect, and as to past transactions unconstitutional. The court therefore did not err in excluding said findings, maps, plats, and surveys.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">It therefore follows that in an action by the state for the recovery of what it claims to be canal lands, it must prove that the lands in question w\u00e9re heretofore canal lands, and in making such proofs it cannot be aided by the findings, maps, plats, and surveys made by the canal commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">Aside from said findings, maps, plats, and surveys thus properly excluded, the state offered no evidence tending to prove that the basin in question had ever constituted part of the canal system of the state. Two witnesses testified that they had gone into the basin with their canal boats and loaded and unloaded them at the docks of the owners of warehouses on or near the banks, turned their boats around in the basin, etc. This user is not at all inconsistent with the basin being a private basin, used by private proprietors in connection with the canal, and for the mutual benefit of both parties, as was the case in <em>Smith </em>v. <em>State, </em>59 Ohio St., 278.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">The first answer filed in the case of <em>Canal Elevator and Warehouse Company </em>v. <em>Buckingham &amp; Mathers, </em>stated that the state of Ohio had excavated said basin, which, if true, would go far to prove that the basin was at one time a part of the canal system of the state; but afterward an amended answer was filed in which it was stated that the basin was excavated by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>the adjoining proprietors for their own benefit, and it was upon this amended answer that the case was tried, and in legal effect the amended answer withdrew the statement that the state had excavated the basin. No evidence therefore is found in the record tending to prove that the basin ever constituted part of the canal system of the state, and the verdict of the jury was right notwithstanding the error of the court in admitting the record in the Warehouse case. As the case went to the jury that error was not prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">There is another reason why the state could not recover, and why the admission of that record was not prejudicial. The lease by the state to Brown &amp; Wood, of date of April 23, 1868, for ninety-nine years renewable forever, was introduced by the state, and the record shows that Brown &amp; Wood accepted the lease without being put into possession, and assigned the lease to the Canal Elevator and Warehouse Company. The latter company waived the right it had to insist that the state should put it into possession, and undertook by action to recover the possession itself, and for that purpose plead and relied upon the lease from the state; so that the state was treated as being out of the contest, and as having performed its duty toward its lessees as to possession, and the lessees assumed the burden of obtaining possession under the lease. Under those- circumstances the state had no further right of action to recover possession, as there could not be one action by the state and another by its lessee. As between the state and its lessees, the case therefore stands as if the state had in fact put its lessees into possession. There is nothing to show that the state has been reinvested with the right of posses<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>sion, and therefore the state had no right of action to recover possession, and the verdict was on this ground also properly in favor of the defendant below.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b235-7\">Williams, C.
