He received an enhanced sentence under the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e), on the basis that his prior offense of lewd or lascivious conduct under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 800.04(6) was a violent felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-8\">Gooch first argues that his state conviction was not a crime of violence under either the \u201celements\u201d clause of \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)\u00a9 or the \u201cresidual\u201d clause of \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii). First, Gooch argues that his conviction was not a crime of violence under \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)\u00a9 because <em>Ramsey v. INS, </em>55 F.3d 580 (11th Cir. 1995), held that a violation of \u00a7 800.04 could be committed without physical force. In the alternative, Gooch argues that his conviction did not satisfy \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii) simply because it presented a serious potential risk of physical injury to another. Specifically, Gooch argues that this Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Rutherford, </em>175 F.3d 899 (11th Cir.1999), was super-ceded by <em>Begay v. United States, </em>553 U.S. 137, 128 S.Ct. 1581, 170 L.Ed.2d 490 (2008), which held that a predicate offense no longer qualifies as a violent felony simply because it involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another. Gooch contends that his conviction fails to meet \u00a7 924(e) (2) (B) (ii) because it is not \u201croughly similar, in kind, as well as in degree of risk posed\u201d to the types of crimes listed as examples of qualifying felonies in \u00a7 924(e) (2) (B) (ii), namely burglary, arson, extortion, and crimes involving the use of explosives. Gooch argues that his conviction is analogous to the DUI conviction at issue in <em>Begay </em>because \u00a7 800.04(6) imposes strict liability insofar as (1) the touching need not be against the will of the victim, (2) the perpetrator\u2019s ignorance of the victim\u2019s age is not a defense to prosecution, and (3) he did not need to have criminal intent to violate the statute. Further, his conviction was not roughly similar in degree of risk to the crimes posed in the <em>Begay </em>examples.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-10\">We review <em>de novo </em>whether a conviction is a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the ACCA. <em>United States v. James, </em>430 F.3d 1150, 1153 (11th Cir.2005). We may affirm a criminal conviction based on any grounds supported in the record. <em>United States v. Mejia, </em>82 F.3d 1032, 1035 (11th Cir.1996); <em>see also United States v. Simmons, </em>368 F.3d 1335, 1342 (11th Cir.2004) (stating, in a criminal case, that we have \u201cthe authority to affirm the district court, even if it is on a ground other than that upon which it based its decision.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-11\">The ACCA provision applies to defendants subject to an enhanced sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e) for having at least three prior convictions for \u201cviolent felonies,\u201d \u201cserious drug offenses,\u201d or both. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.4(a). Section 924(e)(2)(B) defines the term \u201cviolent felony\u201d as any felony that: \u201c(i) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another; or (ii) is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another ...\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-12\">In determining whether a particular offense falls within this definition, the Supreme Court has stated that we must \u201clook[ ] only to the statutory definitions of the prior offenses, and not to the particular facts underlying those convictions.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number><em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 600, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 2159, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990). In limited circumstances, the district court may examine the conduct surrounding a conviction, but only if \u201cambiguities in the judgment make the crime of violence determination impossible from the face of the judgment itself.\u201d <em>United States v. Spell, </em>44 F.3d 936, 939 (11th Cir.1995). In such a case, the district court \u201cmay rely only on the \u2018charging document, written plea agreement, transcript of plea colloquy, and any explicit factual finding by the trial judge to which the defendant assented.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Aguilar-Ortiz, </em>450 F.3d 1271, 1274 (11th Cir.2006) (quoting <em>Shepard, </em>544 U.S. at 15, 125 S.Ct. at 1257). We have held that \u201cour cases interpreting \u2018crime of violence\u2019 under [U.S.S.G.] \u00a7 4B1.2 provide important guidance in determining what is a \u2018violent felony\u2019 under the ACCA because the definitions for both terms are virtually identical.\u201d <em>United States v. Taylor, </em>489 F.3d 1112, 1113 (11th Cir.2007) (quotations and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\">\u201cThe plain meaning of physical force is [pjower, violence, or pressure directed against a person consisting in a physical act.\u201d <em>United States v. Griffith, </em>455 F.3d 1339, 1342 (11th Cir.2006) (quotation &amp; citation omitted). \u201cA person cannot make physical eontact-particularly of an insulting or provoking nature-with another without exerting some level of physical force.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In interpreting a statute similar to \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B), we rejected an argument that physical force requires violent force. <em>See id. </em>at 1343 (interpreting the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(9) requirement that the prior offense of conviction have as an \u201celement, the use or attempted use of physical force, or the threatened use of a deadly weapon\u201d). We have also disagreed with interpretations of physical force that required more than \u201c \u2018Newtonian mechanics\u2019 ... [or] \u2018de minimis\u2019 touching,\u201d stating that Congress could have inserted \u201c \u2018violent\u2019 before the words \u2018physical force\u2019 \u201d but did not do so. <em>Id. </em>at 1343-45. We have held that a violation of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 784.085 for \u201cBattery of a Child by Throwing, Tossing, Projecting, or Expelling Certain Fluids or Materials\u201d involved physical force and was a crime of violence for purposes of the career offender enhancement. <em>United States v. Young, </em>527 F.3d 1274, 1278 (11th Cir.2008) (\u201cThe impact of the fluids against the child creates pressure and this minimal contact satisfies the requirement of physical force.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">The 2001 version of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 800.04(6) at issue in Gooch\u2019s case provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-7\">(a) A person who:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-8\">1. Intentionally touches a person under 16 years of age in a lewd or lascivious manner; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-9\">2. Solicits a person under 16 years of age to commit a lewd or lascivious act commits lewd or lascivious conduct</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-10\">(b) An offender 18 years of age or older who commits lewd or lascivious conduct commits a felony of the second degree ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b608-11\">Fla. Stat. \u00a7 800.04(6) (2001). Because Fla. Stat. \u00a7 800.04(6)(a) is written in the disjunctive, it can be violated by either touching or solicitation. Given this ambiguity, the district court was permitted to inquire into the conduct surrounding Gooch\u2019s conviction by looking at, inter alia, the charging information. <em>Aguilar-Ortiz, </em>450 F.3d at 1274. The certified state information admitted by the sentencing court demonstrated that Gooch violated \u00a7 800.04(6) by intentionally touching a child under the age of 16 in a lewd or lascivious manner when Gooch was over the age of 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-12\">While this Court has never directly addressed whether a conviction under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>\u00a7 800.04(6) is a violent felony for purposes of the ACCA, the intentional touching of a child under 16 years old involves \u201cphysical force\u201d as the Court has interpreted the term in previous cases. <em>Young, </em>527 F.3d at 1278. Gooch is correct that <em>Ramsey </em>noted that a violation of \u00a7 800.04 might be accomplished without the use of physical force. <em>Ramsey, </em>55 F.3d at 583. However, the violation at issue in this case involved actual touching and therefore Gooch\u2019s offense was accomplished with physical force even more involved than that at issue in <em>Young-, </em>thus, the holding in <em>Ramsey </em>is irrelevant. Hence, based on this Court\u2019s previous holdings, Gooch\u2019s conviction for lewd or lascivious conduct involved physical force and should be considered a violent felony for purposes of \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(i) of the ACCA. Because \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)\u00ae is satisfied, this Court need not address the parties\u2019 arguments regarding whether the violation of \u00a7 800.04(6) also falls within the residual provision of \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii). Thus, the district court did not err in finding that Gooch\u2019s conviction under \u00a7 800.04(6) was a violent felony for purposes of \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)\u00ae.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">Second, Gooch contends that his constitutional rights were violated when the district court gave him a sentence enhancement under the ACCA based on three prior convictions that he did not admit to at his guilty plea hearing. Gooch notes that while the Supreme Court has not overturned its decision in <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), it has noted problems with the decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">We review properly preserved constitutional claims <em>de novo, </em>but reverse only for harmful error. <em>United States v. Paz, </em>405 F.3d 946, 948 (11th Cir.2005). In <em>Almen-darez-Torres, </em>the Supreme Court held that a prior conviction is not a fact that must be alleged in the indictment or found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1329 (11th Cir.2005). The Supreme Court\u2019s subsequent seminal decisions in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), have not disturbed the holding of <em>Almendarez-Torres. See Shelton, </em>400 F.3d at 1329. Moreover, in <em>Booker, </em>the Supreme Court stated that \u201c[a]ny fact <em>(other than a prior </em>conviction) which is necessary to support a sentence exceeding the maximum authorized by the facts established by a plea of guilty or a jury verdict must be admitted by the defendant or proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 244, 125 S.Ct. at 756 (emphasis added). \u201cAlthough recent decisions, including <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005), may arguably cast doubt on the future prospects of Almendarez-Torres\u2019s holding regarding prior convictions, the Supreme Court has not explicitly overruled <em>Almen-darez-Torres. </em>As a result, we must follow <em>Almendarez-Ton-es.\u201d United States v. Camacho-Ibarquen, </em>410 F.3d 1307, 1316 n. 3 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-9\">The district court did not err in applying the ACCA enhancement by relying on pri- or convictions to which Gooch did not admit. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-10\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b609-7\">.
