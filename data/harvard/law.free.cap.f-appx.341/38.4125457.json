The district court sentenced Brantman to 168 months of imprisonment on Count 1 and to a consecutive sentence of 120 months of imprisonment on Count 2. Brantman agrees that his guidelines computation was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>correct but challenges his sentence as unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">Brantman first contends that his sentence is unreasonable because the Sentencing Commission failed to meet the purposes and sentencing objectives of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 991(b)(1)(C) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2) when it promulgated U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.5 and \u00a7 2A3.6. He argues that the fact that the district court is free to disagree with the Sentencing Guidelines does not cure the problem because (1) the district courts are nevertheless required to consider the Guidelines; (2) defendants continue to be classified according to whether their conduct is in the heartland of similar offenses; (3) it is unclear whether district courts may develop categorical alternatives when the Guidelines do not reflect the Sentencing Commission\u2019s purposes and objectives; and (4) we presume a guidelines sentence is reasonable. He argues that his sentence should not be presumed reasonable because \u00a7 4B1.5 is not empirically based.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">Brantman correctly asserts that the application of \u00a7 4B1.5 to his prior New York offense of attempted sodomy with a minor caused his guidelines range of imprisonment for Count 1 to increase from 70 to 87 months to 168 to 210 months. Because his New York offense mandated that he register as a sex offender, his offense conduct that violated 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2423(b) also violated 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2260A and ultimately exposed him to the additional mandatory, consecutive 120 months (10 year) sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">Brantman\u2019s concedes that the district court\u2019s sentencing decision was procedurally sound. We consider the \u201csubstantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 596-97, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>accord United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008). District courts have a duty to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors as well as a duty to determine the applicable guidelines range correctly. <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 518-19 (5th Cir.2005). If, in the exercise of discretion, the sentencing judge imposes a sentence within a properly calculated guidelines range, little explanation is required, and we will infer that the district court considered all of the factors for a fair sentence set forth in the guidelines. <em>Id. </em>at 519. Additionally, \u201ca sentence within a properly calculated Guideline range is presumptively reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006); <em>see also Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462-63, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (upholding the application of the presumption of reasonableness to sentences within a properly calculated guidelines range).</p>\n<p id=\"b61-9\">District courts may depart from the Guidelines based on policy considerations, even in routine cases. <em>United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 365-66 (5th Cir.2009) (applying plain error review), <em>petition for cert, filed </em>(June 24, 2009) (No. 08-11099). District courts have the discretion to consider \u201cpolicy decisions behind the Guidelines, including the presence of absence of empirical data, as part of their \u00a7 3553(a) analysis.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 366.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-10\">The Sentencing Commission \u201chas the capacity courts lack to \u2018base its determinations on empirical data and national experience, guided by a professional staff with appropriate expertise.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 574-75, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007)). Even when the relevant guideline is not empirically based, however, \u201cby the time an appeals court reviews a Guidelines sentence, both the Sentencing Commission and the district court have fulfilled their congressional mandate to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and have arrived at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>same conclusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, we review a district court\u2019s decision to award a guidelines sentence that is not empirically grounded under the same deferential standard we use to review guidelines sentences that are empirically grounded, regardless whether application of the challenged guideline \u201cdramatically increased\u201d the punishment for the offense based on a defendant\u2019s criminal history. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 530-31 (5th Cir.2009) (reviewing sentence for reasonableness); Mondra<em>gon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d at 367. Brantman\u2019s disagreement with his sentence on the assertion that the Sentencing Commission failed to meet its goals and purpose in promulgating \u00a7 4B1.5 is insufficient to rebut the presumption that his within-guidelines sentence is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">Brantman contends in his reply brief that, based on his personal characteristics and the nature of his offense, his correctly calculated guidelines sentence is greater than necessary to meet the sentencing objectives of \u00a7 3553(a)(2). Although Brant-man did not make this argument in his opening brief, the government raised this issue in its brief, so we exercise our discretion to consider it. <em>See United States v. Ramirez, </em>557 F.3d 200, 203 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">Brantman describes himself as penniless, lovelorn, and homeless, describes his teenage victim as lovelorn, and compares himself favorably to offenders who actually succeed in making sexual contact with their victims and to offenders who contact depraved parents seeking to abuse their children. The district court considered the facts of the case and Brantman\u2019s personal characteristics, agreed that the ease was \u201csomewhat unusual,\u201d and selected a low-end guidelines sentence based on these facts. The district court listed several factors to support the sentence it chose, including the need to protect minors from predatory conduct, Brantman\u2019s history of similar conduct, the extent to which he went to execute the offense, the seriousness of the offense, the need to promote respect for this area of law and to afford adequate deterrence, and the need for just punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">The totality of the circumstances considered in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors supports the sentence that the district court imposed. <em>See Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597. Brantman\u2019s argument regarding his characteristics and the nature of his offense essentially asks us to reweigh the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. That we \u201cmight reasonably have concluded that a different sentence was appropriate is insufficient to justify reversal of the district court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Brantman has not shown that his sentence amounts to an abuse of discretion. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b62-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b60-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
