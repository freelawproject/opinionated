Mendieta, a citizen of Colombia, claimed past persecution by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (\u201cFARC\u201d) based on his activities as a member of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>Primero Colombia political party distributing flyers and coordinating youth outreach efforts. After review, we deny the petition for review.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">An alien seeking withholding of removal must show that his \u201clife or freedom would be threatened in that country because of [his] race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d INA \u00a7 241(b)(3)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A). In other words, the alien bears the burden to show that it is \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that he will be persecuted on account of one of the five protected grounds if returned to his country. <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2003) (hyphens omitted). To establish eligibility, the alien must show either that he suffered past persecution or that he has a well-founded fear of future persecution. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b)(l)(2); <em>Mendoza, </em>327 F.3d at 1287.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">Although the INA does not define persecution, this Court has stated that \u201cpersecution is an extreme concept requiring more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation.\u201d <em>Ruiz v. Gonzales, </em>479 F.3d 762, 766 (11th Cir.2007) (quotation marks omitted). This Court has concluded that threats in conjunction with a brief detention or a minor physical attack that did not result in serious physical injury do not rise to the level of persecution. <em>See, e.g., Djonda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>514 F.3d 1168, 1174 (11th Cir.2008) (36-hour detention, beating and threat of arrest); <em>Zheng v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>451 F.3d 1287, 1290-91 (11th Cir.2006) (5-day detention).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-9\">Here, we cannot say the evidence compels a conclusion that Mendieta suffered past persecution. During Mendiota\u2019s six brief encounters with the FARC over a two-month period, the FARC threatened and insulted him. In addition, in two encounters, the FARC pushed Mendieta. In a third encounter, Mendieta was kicked twice. During the final encounter, four FARC members carrying poles chased Mendieta for several minutes. However, Mendieta never suffered any physical injury as a result of his brushes with the FARC.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-10\">This harassment falls short of the extreme mistreatment found in other cases in which this Court has concluded that the record compelled a conclusion that the petitioner was persecuted. <em>See, e.g., De Santamaria v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>525 F.3d 999, 1008-10 (11th Cir.2008) (involving repeated death threats, torture and murder of petitioner\u2019s groundskeeper, assault resulting in hospitalization, kidnapping and beating with guns resulting in hospitalization); <em>Niftaliev v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>504 F.3d 1211, 1215-17 (11th Cir.2007) (involving threats, numerous interrogations and beatings dur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>ing a 15-day detention that resulted in two-month hospitalization, and two subsequent physical attacks after petitioner fled to Argentina); <em>Mejia v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>498 F.3d 1253, 1257-58 (11th Cir.2007) (involving written threats and \u201ccondolence\u201d letter, assault with a rock and detention at gunpoint, during which petitioner was thrown to the ground and hit with a gun, breaking his nose and requiring surgery); <em>Sanchez Jimenez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>492 F.3d 1223, 1233 (11th Cir.2007) (involving attempted murder of petitioner, attempted kidnapping of his daughter, and death threats); <em>Delgado v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>487 F.3d 855, 861-62 (11th Cir.2007) (involving threatening phone calls, car vandalization, detention by masked men who pointed and mock fired unloaded guns at petitioners, and a severe beating requiring medical treatment).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">Therefore, we cannot say the BIA erred in denying Mendieta\u2019s claim for withholding of removal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b580-6\">. Mendieta does not challenge the BIA\u2019s denial of his requests for asylum or for relief under the United Nations Convention Against Torture or the BIA\u2019s conclusions regarding future persecution in his request for withholding of removal. Thus, we do not address these claims further. <em>See Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b580-7\">. \u201cWe review only the [BIA's] decision, except to the extent that it expressly adopts the IJ's opinion.\u201d <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). Here, because the BIA did not adopt the IJ\u2019s opinion or his reasoning, we review only the BIA\u2019s decision. We review a factual determination that an alien is statutorily ineligible for withholding of removal under the substantial evidence test. <em>Id. </em>at 1283-84. Under the substantial evidence standard, \u201cwe must find that the record not only supports reversal, but compels it.\u201d <em>Mendoza, </em>327 F.3d at 1287.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b581-8\">. We reject Mendieta's argument that the BIA did not give sufficient deference to the IJ\u2019s past persecution finding. The BIA reviews <em>de novo </em>\"the application of legal standards [to factual determinations), such as whether the facts established by an alien amount to past persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution.\" <em>In re A-S-B, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 493, 496 (BIA 2008) (quotation marks omitted). Thus, the BIA was not required to defer to the IJ's finding that the mistreatment amounted to persecution.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
