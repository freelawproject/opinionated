Todd sued his former employer, Defendant-Appellee Michael J. Astrue, Commissioner of the Social Security Administration (SSA), asserting numerous violations of Title VII and the Americans with Disabilities Act. He based his claims on assertions of discrimination based on his race, his sex, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>disability, and retaliation for filing administrative EEO complaints. The district court granted Astrue\u2019s motion for summary judgment and dismissed all of Todd\u2019s claims. Todd timely filed a notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">We have reviewed the record on appeal, including the district court\u2019s Memorandum of Opinion which thoroughly analyzes all aspects of Todd\u2019s claims, disposing of each in turn. We are satisfied that the district court accurately applied the law to the facts and arrived at the correct conclusion. Our decision is reinforced by the declarations of Todd\u2019s seven supervisors, which recount what the district court kindly called Todd\u2019s \u201cprevious misconduct.\u201d Among the misconduct his supervisors swore to: Todd was \u201calways disruptive during unit meetings;\u201d was \u201cargumentative and insubordinate with his supervisors;\u201d was \u201cextremely willful;\u201d \u201cseemed to enjoy an audience and like[d] to challenge management during staff meetings;\u201d was \u201cdisruptive;\u201d had a \u201cconfrontational relationship\u201d with his superiors; \u201cbehaved in a manner that made his co-workers uncomfortable,\u201d which included \u201cstaring at women as they walked by\u201d and \u201cmaking derogatory comments;\u201d was \u201cquite belligerent;\u201d \u201cseemed determined not to follow the instructions of his supervisors;\u201d and was \u201cvery arrogant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">And Todd did not just misbehave. He also misperformed. His supervisors described Todd\u2019s work quality this way: his \u201cperformance was not up to par;\u201d he had \u201ca problem following written guidelines;\u201d he \u201cwas not inclined to defer to SSA policies and procedures;\u201d he \u201cwas unable to read, interpret and apply the information available on various inquiries;\u201d his \u201cinefficient work habits contributed to his inability to handle a proportionate share of incoming calls;\u201d that when he did take calls, he \u201cplaee[d] callers on hold for extended periods of time,\u201d gave them \u201cincorrect information, took erroneous actions,\u201d and \u201cviolated SSA policy by releasing information to unauthorized persons;\u201d he was unable to handle routine calls in an efficient and timely manner;\u201d he had a tendency to \u201cdevelop issues that were not important or even relevant to the call;\u201d and \u201chis performance was not equal to that of his colleagues.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b582-9\">We, like one of Todd\u2019s supervisors, \u201cmight not have recommended keeping' him after the expiration of his probationary period.\u201d Actions of an employer that are too kind, however, are not a basis for a lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-10\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b582-6\">.
