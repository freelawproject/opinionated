No. 105-100, 111 Stat. 2160, 2198-99 (1997). Yat argues that the BIA erred in finding that he had not shown sufficient hardship to warrant cancellation of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-6\">Section 203 of NACARA amended \u00a7 309(f) of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, Pub.L. No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009, to establish rules to permit certain classes of aliens, including those from Guatemala, to apply for cancellation of removal under what is titled the \u201cSPECIAL RULE FOR CANCELLATION OF REMOVAL.\u201d Ill Stat. 2160, 2198-99. Pursuant to the \u201cspecial rule,\u201d eligible aliens may seek cancellation of removal under Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) \u00a7 240A (codified at 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b). <em>Id. </em>To succeed, the applicant must show, inter alia, that (1) he has been present in the United States for at least seven years immediately preceding the date on which he filed his application, (2) he has been a person of good moral character during that period, and (3) his removal would result in extreme hardship to either himself or a qualifying relative. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1013-7\">The application for cancellation of removal under the special rules applied to certain Guatemalans under NACARA is subject to the jurisdiction-stripping provision of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B). <em>See </em>NA-CARA \u00a7 203(b), 111 Stat. 2160, 2198-99. Accordingly, we lack jurisdiction to review the challenge to the BIA\u2019s denial of that form of discretionary relief. <em>See Sung v. Keisler, </em>505 F.3d 372, 377 (5th Cir.2007). However, \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B) does not prevent this court from considering constitutional claims or questions of law. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D). While attempting to couch his arguments as questions of law, Yat\u2019s arguments boil down to a dispute over the Immigration Judge\u2019s weighing and finding of facts. Accordingly, this court lacks jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s denial of Yat\u2019s application for cancellation of removal under NACARA \u00a7 203(b). <em>See Sung, </em>505 F.3d at 377.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-12\">Yat\u2019s petition for review is DISMISSED for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1013-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
