After production difficulties developed, Miller reassigned Johnson to work in his former department, without a cut in pay, and noted both his performance problems, as well as his experience in the Quality department, as its reasons for the reassignment. Johnson responded by filing the present suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">Johnson argues on appeal that the district court erred in finding that he failed to establish a prima facie case that Miller treated similarly situated managers more favorably. Johnson asserts that two white managers, Shuman and Brown, also did not meet Miller\u2019s objective performance standards yet received better performance evaluation ratings and were not reassigned. Johnson argues since all three managers fell short of the objective benchmarks, the district court erred in exploring the degree of failure between them.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">We review a district court order granting summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>viewing all the facts in the record in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, and drawing all inferences in his favor. <em>Frederick v. Sprint/United Mgmt. Co., </em>246 F.3d 1305, 1311 (11th Cir.2001). A party opposing a properly submitted motion for summary judgment must set forth specific facts showing the genuine issue. <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 256, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 2514, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). The nonmoving party must provide more than a \u201cmere scintilla of evidence\u201d to survive such a motion, and there must be a substantial conflict in evidence to support a jury question. <em>Mendoza v. Borden, Inc., </em>195 F.3d 1238, 1244 (11th Cir.1999) <em>(en banc).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b500-9\">Title VII makes it unlawful for an employer to \u201cdiscriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual\u2019s race.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(l). In evaluating a Title VII disparate treatment claim supported by circumstantial evidence, we use the analysis as set forth in <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 802, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 1824, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973). <em>Wilson v. B/E Aerospace, Inc., </em>376 F.3d 1079, 1087 (11th Cir.2004). Under this framework, the plaintiff has the burden of establishing a <em>prima facie </em>case of disparate treatment, which he can do by \u201cshowing that [he] was a qualified member of a protected class and was subjected to an adverse employment action in contrast with similarly situated employees outside the protected class.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b500-10\">A plaintiff is similarly situated to another employee only if the \u201cquantity and quality of the comparator\u2019s misconduct\u201d are \u201cnearly identical.\u201d <em>Burke-Fowler v. Orange County, Fla., </em>447 F.3d 1319, 1323 (11th Cir.2006) (citation and quotation omitted). Likewise, plaintiff and the comparators must be similarly situated in \u201call relevant respects.\u201d <em>Wilson, </em>376 F.3d at 1091 (citation omitted). This prevents <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>\u201ccourts from second-guessing employers\u2019 reasonable decisions and confusing apples with oranges.\u201d <em>Burke-Fowler, </em>447 F.3d at 1323 (citation and quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">In <em>Knight v. Baptist Hospital of Miami, </em>330 F.3d 1313, 1319 (11th Cir.2003), we affirmed the grant of summary judgment against the plaintiff by finding that the proffered comparator was not similarly situated. We specifically noted that while both employees displayed similar \u201chistories of problems with coworkers,\u201d the comparator\u2019s record was \u201csubstantially better\u201d than the plaintiffs regarding the areas of \u201cjob performance and tardiness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1316-17. In addition, we noted that even though the comparator also experienced difficulties in terms of job performance and tardiness, the plaintiffs \u201cdocumented performance and tardiness problems\u201d were substantially worse in \u201cboth number and nature.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1317-1319.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">In this case, Johnson failed to demonstrate that the two white managers were treated more favorably by Miller. Our holding in <em>Knight </em>squarely refutes Johnson\u2019s arguments that \u201cfailure is failure\u201d and the relative \u201cdegrees of failure\u201d cannot be taken into account. <em>See id. </em>at 1316-17. Similar to the plaintiff in <em>Knight, </em>Johnson only proffered comparators who also failed objective performance benchmarks without considering the degree of failure that separated him from the rest. <em>Id. </em>at 1317-19. Since Johnson was the worst performer of the three, he failed to prove a prima facie case that similarly situated employees were treated more favorably by Miller.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b500-7\">. Johnson does not challenge on appeal the grant of summary judgment as to his tortious interference with employment, intentional infliction of emotion distress, and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981 claims. Accordingly, any claim in this respect is waived. <em>See United States v. Levy, </em>379 F.3d 1241, 1242-43 (11th Cir.2004) (holding that claims not raised in the initial brief are deemed waived).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b501-9\">. Accordingly, we need not reach the issue of whether Miller proffered a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its actions and, whelher Johnson proffered any evidence to show that the reason given was pretextual.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
