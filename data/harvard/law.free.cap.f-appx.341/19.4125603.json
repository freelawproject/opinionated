He appeals only his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-10\">In exchange for Bellorin\u2019s guilty plea, the Government agreed, <em>inter alia, </em>to move for a two-level reduction in Bellorin\u2019s offense level, pursuant to United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 5K3.1, and to recommend that Bellorin be sentenced at the low end of the applicable advisory guidelines sentencing range. At sentencing, however, the Government did not make a \u00a7 5K3.1 motion and, when asked for its position on sentencing, requested a sentence at the high end of the sentencing range. Bellorin was sentenced, <em>inter alia, </em>to 78-months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-15\">As held recently in <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 1428, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009), because the breach-of-the-plea-agreement issue was raised for the first time on appeal, review is only for plain error. To show reversible plain error, Bellorin must show a clear or obvious error that affects his substantial rights. <em>Id. </em>at 1429. If he makes such a showing, our court has discretion to correct the error, but, generally, will correct it only if it seriously affects \u201cthe fairness, integrity[,] or public reputation of judicial proceedings\u201d. <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 736, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993)). The Government, through omission and commission, breached the plea agreement. Therefore, as the Government concedes, there was a clear or obvious error. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b42-18\">Concerning whether this plain error affected Bellorin\u2019s substantial rights, there is nothing in the record to indicate that the district court would not have granted a \u00a7 5K3.1 motion as a matter of course. Without the \u00a7 5K3.1 two-level reduction, Bellorin\u2019s advisory sentencing range was 70 to 87 months; with the reduction, it would have been 57 to 71 months. Additionally, consistent with recommendations by both the Government and the probation officer that Bellorin be sentenced at the high end of the sentencing range, the district court imposed a mid-range sentence of 78 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-19\">There is a reasonable probability that, had the \u00a7 5K3.1 motion been made, Bello-rin would have received a lesser sentence. And, had the Govermnent recommended a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>low-end sentence, Bellorin\u2019s sentence would likely have been lesser still.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">Because the error likely affected the outcome of the sentencing proceedings, Bellorin has shown that his substantial rights were affected. <em>Puckett, </em>129 S.Ct. at 1433 n. 4. Further, the error affected the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of these proceedings. Accordingly, pursuant to our discretion, Bellorin\u2019s sentence is vacated and this matter is remanded to district court for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">CONVICTION AFFIRMED; SENTENCE VACATED; REMANDED FOR RESENTENCING.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b42-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
