Baldwin\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion was based on Amendment 706 to the Guidelines, which reduced base offense levels applicable to crack cocaine. On appeal, Baldwin argues that the district court erred in finding that he was sentenced as a career offender because he actually was sentenced to the statutory minimum sentence of life imprisonment, pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). Baldwin further argues that: (1) his statutory life sentence violated <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), based on the limited facts proved at trial; and (2) he qualifies for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction under the Supreme Court\u2019s <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), line of caselaw, the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and the crack/cocaine powder disparity.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-13\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008). We may affirm the district court\u2019s decision \u201con any ground that finds support in the record.\u201d <em>United States v. Mejia, </em>82 F.3d 1032, 1035 (11th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-14\">A district court may modify a term of imprisonment in the case of a defendant who was sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). However, when the district court is determining whether to modify a defendant\u2019s sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2), <em>\u201call </em>original sentencing determinations remain unchanged with the sole exception of the guideline range that has been amended since the original sentencing.\u201d <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 781 (11th Cir.2000) (emphasis in the original).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-15\">Although Baldwin is correct that he was not sentenced as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 because he instead re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>ceived a mandatory life sentence under \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A), the district court still properly denied \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief. We recently held that a defendant who was sentenced to a statutory minimum term of imprisonment cannot have his guideline range lowered by the Sentencing Commission. <em>United States v. </em>Williams, 549 F.3d 1337, 1339-41 (11th Cir.2008). Baldwin\u2019s remaining arguments are likewise barred by precedent. <em>See United States v. Jones, </em>548 F.3d 1366, 1369 (11th Cir.2008) (holding that <em>Booker </em>does not, by itself, permit a district court to impose a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction); <em>Bravo, </em>203 F.3d at 781 (prohibiting courts from revisiting original sentencing decisions during a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding). Accordingly, we hereby affirm the district court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b542-15\">.
