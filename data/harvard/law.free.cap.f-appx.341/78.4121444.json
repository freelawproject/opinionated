We previously remanded this case to the district court for a determination whether Gandara could show good cause or excusable neglect for his untimeliness under Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(1)(A). Although the district court found that Gandara had not made the necessary showing, the Government now urges that we ignore any possible Rule 4 violation and address the merits of Gan-dara\u2019s appeal. Such a course is permissible; although the Rule 4 deadline is mandatory, it is not jurisdictional because it does not derive from a statute. <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>496 F.3d 387, 388-90 (5th Cir.) (holding that a late notice of appeal is not a jurisdictional bar and affirming sentence on the merits), <em>cert. denied, </em>552 U.S. 1070, 128 S.Ct. 728, 169 L.Ed.2d 568 (2007). We so proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-15\">Gandara argues that, because his indictment did not specify that he used a short-barreled shotgun, his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the district court\u2019s determination that his statutory minimum sentence was ten years of imprisonment pursuant to \u00a7 924(c)(l)(B)(i). To prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, a petitioner must show (1) that his counsel\u2019s performance was deficient in that it fell below an objective standard of reasonableness, and (2) that the deficient performance prejudiced his defense. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 689-94, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). We resolve Gandara\u2019s claim on direct appeal only because it pres<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>ents a rare instance when we are able to \u201cevaluate fairly the merits of the claim.\u201d <em>United States v. Nguyen, </em>504 F.3d 561, 575 (5th Cir.2007) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 1324, 170 L.Ed.2d 135 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">While this court has not decided the issue, at least one of our sister circuits has held that the type of firearm used in a \u00a7 924(c)(1)(B) offense constitutes an element of the offense that must be included in the indictment and proven to a jury <em>when not admitted by the defendant. United States v. Harris, </em>397 F.3d 404, 410-414 (6th Cir.2005) (addressing the effects of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), on \u00a7 924(c)(1)(B) analysis). We need not resolve the issue in this case, however, because, even assuming that the use of a short-barreled shotgun was an element of Gandara\u2019s offense, his conviction and sentence are not invalid; he admitted that he used a short-barreled shotgun in the factual basis for his guilty plea. <em>See Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 232, 244, 125 S.Ct. 738. Gandara does not contend that counsel was ineffective in advising him regarding his guilty plea or the plea agreement. Accordingly, Gandara\u2019s counsel did not render ineffective assistance by failing to object at sentencing regarding the consideration of Gandara\u2019s use of a shotgun. <em>See Clark v. Collins, </em>19 F.3d 959, 966 (5th Cir.1994) (\u201cFailure to raise meritless objections is not ineffective lawyering; it is the very opposite.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b101-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
