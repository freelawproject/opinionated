Hull, </em>238 Fed.Appx. 543 (11th Cir.2007), we affirmed appellant\u2019s convictions and sentences for possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), and possession of marijuana, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 844(a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On March 5, 2008, appellant moved the district court to reduce his sentence for the cocaine offense pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) based on Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines. The district court denied his motion on the ground that he was not eligible for a sentence reduction because Amendment 706 did not have an effect of lowering the Guideline sentence range for appellant\u2019s cocaine offense; the amendment applies only in crack cocaine cases. The court did not address the question of whether appellant could receive the reduction on other grounds, such as the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-23\">Appellant now appeals the court\u2019s ruling. He concedes that <em>United States v. Melvin, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>556 F.3d 1190 (11th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied,-</em>U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 2382, 173 L.Ed.2d 1300 (2009), held that <em>Booker </em>did not apply in \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings, but argues that <em>Melvin </em>was wrongly decided. He argues further that the district court should have considered that he had successfully completed a drug abuse program and that unequal application of \u00a7 3582(c)(2) based on whether a defendant was sentenced before or after <em>Booker </em>denies him due process and equal protection of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">A district court may modify a term of imprisonment on the ground that the Guidelines sentence range has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Resen-tencing under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is not available under Amendment 706, however, unless the amendment lowers the defendant\u2019s base offense level and Guidelines sentence range. <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 986 (11th Cir.2008). Amendment 706 did not lower the base offense level for appellant\u2019s cocaine offense; hence, it is inapplicable here. <em>Melvin </em>forecloses appellant\u2019s <em>Booker </em>argument, as well as his arguments based on his satisfactory completion of the drug abuse program and the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses. Section 3582(c)(2) is not a vehicle for revisiting the merits of appellant\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b595-16\">. The district court sentenced appellant to prison for 87 months for the cocaine offense and a concurrent 12 months for the marijuana offense.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
