Hicks\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion was based on Amendment 706 to the United States Sentencing Guidelines, which reduced base offense levels applicable to crack cocaine offenses. On appeal, Hicks argues that <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), authorize a district court, in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding, to (1) reduce the defendant\u2019s offense level by more than two levels, and (2) reduce the sentence of a career offender. He acknowledges that his argument is foreclosed by precedent, including <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323 (11th Cir. 2008), <em>cert. denied, McFadden v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 965, 173 L.Ed.2d 156 (2009), and <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 1601, 173 L.Ed.2d 689 (2009), and <em>United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 2382, 173 L.Ed.2d 1300 (2009). However, he contends that <em>Moore </em>and <em>Melvin </em>were wrongly decided and explains that he brought this appeal to preserve his arguments for the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">\u201cIn a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding, we review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under the Sentencing Guidelines\u201d as well as all \u201cquestions of statutory interpretation.\u201d <em>Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1326 (quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">Under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court may reduce the sentence of a defendant who was sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-8\">In <em>Moore, </em>we held that, if the defendant was sentenced as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 and the range was not affected by U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, then his sentence is not \u201cbased on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered.\u201d 541 F.3d at 1327-28. In <em>Melvin, </em>we rejected the argument that <em>Booker </em>and <em>Kimbrough </em>prohibit limitations on a judge\u2019s discretion in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding. 556 F.3d at 1192. We have also held that a defendant is not entitled to a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction by virtue of the advisory nature of the guidelines. <em>United States v. Jones, </em>548 F.3d 1366, 1369 (11th Cir.2008), <em>cert denied, </em>- U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1657, 173 L.Ed.2d 1025 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-10\">As Hieks acknowledges, his arguments are foreclosed by binding precedent. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order denying Hicks\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
