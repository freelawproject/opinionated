The complaint sought damages arising out of alleged violations of Mrs. Guzman\u2019s statutory rights that resulted in Mrs. Guzman falling and fracturing her hip. (R.l-2.) Following discovery, the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. Emeritus also filed a <em>Daubert </em>motion to preclude testimony by Guzman\u2019s expert witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>The district court disposed of these motions in one written order. (R.4-43.) The court granted Emeritus\u2019s <em>Daubert </em>motion and denied Guzman\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Having excluded Guzman\u2019s expert witnesses\u2019 testimony that had been proffered to show that Emeritus had breached its duty of care to Minerva Guzman, the court granted Emeritus\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The court reasoned that summary judgment was appropriate because, having ruled that Guzman\u2019s expert witnesses\u2019 testimony was inadmissible, there was no evidence of breach, proximate cause, or damages. <em>(Id. </em>at 8.) The court held in the alternative that, even if Guzman\u2019s expert witnesses\u2019 testimony were admissible, none of the \u201calleged breaches of duty could be construed as the proximate cause of Mrs. Guzman\u2019s fall from her bed on October 17, 2008.\u201d <em>(Id.) </em>The court concluded that, without the expert testimony, Guzman had not shown breach, proximate cause, or damages. And, the court concluded that, even if the expert testimony were considered, Guzman had not shown proximate cause. The court granted summary judgnent on these grounds. Guzman filed a notice of appeal identifying the grant of Emeritus\u2019s motion to preclude expert witnesses\u2019 testimony and the grant of summary judgnent to Emeritus as subjects of his appeal. (R.4-47.)</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">Emeritus argues that this court has no jurisdiction over this appeal because Guzman has not appealed a final order of the district court, but rather appealed the order precluding his expert witnesses\u2019 testimony. We disagree. Guzman\u2019s notice of appeal states that he appeals the order granting summary judgment. Additionally, his initial brief implicitly challenges the propriety of the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to the extent that it was based on the court\u2019s conclusion that his proffered expert witnesses\u2019 testimony was inadmissible. (Appellant\u2019s Br. at 9-10.) <em>See Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Ins. Corp. v. Haralson, </em>813 F.2d 370, 373 n.3 (11th Cir. 1987) (\u201cBriefs are read liberally to ascertain issues raised on appeal.\u201d) (citation omitted). Accordingly, we have jurisdiction to hear Guzman\u2019s appeal challenging the propriety of the district court\u2019s g-ant of summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">Guzman argues at length that the district court erred in excluding the expert witnesses\u2019 testimony. Guzman has not, however, demonstrated that the district court\u2019s alternative ground for granting summary judgment \u2014 that even if the expert testimony were admissible Guzman had not made any showing of proximate cause \u2014 was in error. Accordingly, we conclude that the district court properly granted summary judgment on the ground that Guzman failed to show proximate cause. The judgnent of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
