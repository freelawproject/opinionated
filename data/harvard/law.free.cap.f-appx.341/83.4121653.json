The district court dismissed the complaint for lack of jurisdiction, and Melawer now appeals. For the following reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-13\">\u201cA case is properly dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction when the court lacks the statutory or constitutional power to adjudicate the case.\u201d <em>Home Builders Ass\u2019n of Miss., Inc. v. City of Madison, </em>143 F.3d 1006, 1010 (5th Cir.1998). Absent specific statutory authority, the scope of a district court\u2019s power to order ex-pungement of executive-branch records is narrow: \u201cIn order to have standing to seek expungement, the party seeking ex-pungement against executive agencies must assert an affirmative rights violation by the executive actors holding the records of the overturned conviction.\u201d <em>Sealed Appellant v. Sealed Appellee, </em>130 F.3d 695, 699 (5th Cir.1997); <em>see United States v. McLeod, </em>385 F.2d 734, 750 (5th Cir.1967) (ordering expungement where state officials were intentionally using arrest records to prevent minorities from voting).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-15\">Here, Melawer alleges only that the existence of the records creates certain personal burdens, such as added delays in renewing his various licenses. Because Melawer has failed to (1) identify an independent statutory basis for his request or (2) to allege an \u201caffirmative rights violation\u201d by the executive actors holding his records, the district court properly declined to exercise jurisdiction. <em>See Sealed Appellant, </em>130 F.3d at 699.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b106-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
