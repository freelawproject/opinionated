Sarras, </em>571 F.3d 1111 (11th Cir.2009), which has since been vacated, we hereby <em>sua sponte </em>VACATE the previous opinion issued in this case, <em>United States v. Duhart, </em>2009 WL 1965291 (11th Cir. June 9, 2009). In its place, we file this revised opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-15\">Amal Duhart pleaded guilty to one count of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g) &amp; 924(e). He was sentenced by the district court to 188 months\u2019 imprisonment. He now appeals the reasonableness of his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-16\">I. Facts and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b533-17\">On August 8, 2008, Duhart, a convicted felon, was arrested following an incident in which he and another individual allegedly pointed firearms at a crowd of people. Duhart was indicted and later pleaded guilty to one count of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. Due to Duhart\u2019s criminal history, this charge carried a statutory minimum sentence of fifteen years\u2019 (180 months) imprisonment and a maximum of life imprisonment. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b533-18\">The probation officer prepared a presen-tence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d), which included documentation of Duhart\u2019s prior convictions, as well as arrests for which no charges had been filed or the charges had been dismissed. The PSI initially identified the offense level as 27 and assigned Duhart a criminal history category VI. Because Duhart had at least three prior convictions for serious drug offenses, he qualified as an armed career criminal under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.4 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e). This status increased Duhart\u2019s offense level to 31, after an adjustment for acceptance of responsibility. With a total offense level of 31 and a criminal history category VI, Duhart\u2019s guidelines range was 188 to 235 months\u2019 imprisonment. Duhart did not object to any of the relevant information outlined above.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>At sentencing, the government requested that Duhart receive a sentence at the upper end of the guidelines range. Du-hart argued that he should receive the mandatory minimum sentence of 180 months and also noted that he suffered from rheumatoid arthritis and had been unable to get proper medical treatment during his incarceration. After hearing the arguments and giving Duhart an opportunity to personally address the court, the district court said that \u201csomething more than the minimum would be required.\u201d The district court noted that since Du-hart\u2019s last drug conviction, which occurred about eight years earlier, \u201che\u2019s been in and out of trouble for a long time. And it\u2019s not just drugs. There are a lot of assaults and battery and that sort of thing.\u201d The district court then stated that \u201cgun charges are very serious situations,\u201d and, after it considered the guidelines and the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3558(a), the court concluded that the \u201cbottom of the guideline sentence is fair\u201d and sentenced Duhart to 188 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">Duhart now appeals the substantive reasonableness of this sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">We review the substantive reasonableness of a sentence for abuse of discretion, based on the \u201ctotality of the circumstances.\u201d <em>United States v. Beckles, </em>565 F.3d 832, 845 (11th Cir.2009).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">Duhart argues that the sentence imposed is unreasonable because the district court gave too much weight to the number of times that he was arrested but not convicted, and gave no weight to the inability of the Bureau of Prisons to accommodate his medical condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-9\">The party challenging the reasonableness of a sentence \u201cbears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in the light of both [the] record and the factors in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). It is sufficient for the district court to acknowledge that it has considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, but it need not explicitly discuss each of them. <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cThe weight to be accorded any given \u00a7 3553(a) factor is a matter committed to the sound discretion of the district court.\u201d <em>United States v. Clay, </em>483 F.3d 739, 743 (11th Cir.2007) (quotation omitted). Even though a sentence is not <em>per se </em>reasonable by virtue of residing within the guidelines range, \u201cthere is a range of reasonable sentences from which the district court may choose, and when the district court imposes a sentence within the advisory Guidelines range, we ordinarily will expect that choice to be a reasonable one.\u201d <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-10\">At the outset, we note that the district court imposed a sentence that was just eight months greater than the statutory minimum sentence, and which resided at the lowest end of the forty-seven month range, as established by the guidelines. Second, even though the district court noted that Duhart had been \u201cin and out of trouble\u201d since the time of his last drug conviction in 2000, the district court did not necessarily rely on arrests for which Duhart had not been convicted in reaching this conclusion. Duhart\u2019s PSI reveals that he was convicted of forgery in the first degree in 2005 and two counts of simple battery and one count of disorderly conduct in 2006. This evidence, particularly the simple battery convictions, supports <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>the district court\u2019s conclusion that \u201che\u2019s been in and out of trouble for a long time. And it\u2019s not just drugs. There are a lot of assaults and battery and that sort of thing.\u201d Third, even if the district court considered arrests in addition to convictions, a district court may consider arrests in determining the defendant\u2019s character, so long as those arrests are not used to statutorily enhance the defendant\u2019s sentence. <em>See United States v. Peagler, </em>847 F.2d 756, 758 (11th Cir.1988) (permitting the district court\u2019s consideration of un-counseled convictions to conclude that the defendant \u201cdid not have much respect for the law\u201d). Finally, the district court considered Duhart\u2019s health condition and concluded that \u201c[rjheumatoid arthritis is probably not all that uncommon among the prison population\u201d and that the Bureau of Prisons should be able to evaluate and treat that condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">We thus conclude that Duhart\u2019s sentence of 188 months\u2019 imprisonment is substantively reasonable. Accordingly, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b534-8\">. Generally, we first review for procedural errors, such as treating the guidelines as mandatory or failing to consider \u00a7 3553(a) mitigating factors. <em>Beckles, </em>565 F.3d at 845. In the instant case, however, Duhart only appeals the substantive reasonableness of his sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
