Montgomery argues that the district court erred in determining that he was not entitled to raise his claims in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-16\">Montgomery has not shown that the district court erred in its determination. As a general rule, a federal prisoner who seeks to collaterally challenge the legality of his convictions or sentence must file a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>Padilla v. United States, </em>416 F.3d 424, 425-26 (5th Cir. 2005). Such claims may be raised in a \u00a7 2241 petition under the savings clause of \u00a7 2255(e) only if the prisoner shows that the \u00a7 2255 remedy is \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d \u00a7 2255(e). Montgomery has not made such a showing. Montgomery argues that he should be allowed to proceed under \u00a7 2241, despite his inability to satisfy the test of <em>Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904 (5th Cir.2001), because he has not been allowed to proceed under \u00a7 2255 with his evidence of his innocence. His inability to meet the requirements for filing a successive \u00a7 2255 motion does not render \u00a7 2255 inadequate or ineffective. <em>Pack v. Yusuff, </em>218 F.3d 448, 452-53 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b31-17\">Montgomery has not shown that he should be allowed to raise his claims in a \u00a7 2241 petition notwithstanding his failure to meet the requirements of the savings clause. He has not established that his alleged actual innocence provides a \u201cgateway\u201d through which the district court is authorized to review his claims. Addition<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>ally, Montgomery has not shown that the district court should hear his claims because the requirements of \u00a7 2255\u2019s savings clause violate the Suspension Clause of the United States Constitution. <em>See Wesson v. United States Penitentiary Beaumont, Tex., </em>305 F.3d 343, 347 (5th Cir.2002). The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b31-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
