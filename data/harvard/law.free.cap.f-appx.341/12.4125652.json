Leatch argues that his sentence is procedurally unreasonable because the district court failed to provide sufficient reasons for imposing a within-guidelines sentence. Because Leatch did not preserve this objection in the district court, review is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 364 (5th Cir. 2009); <em>United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 339 (5th Cir.), cert. <em>denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 328, 172 L.Ed.2d 236 (2008). Leatch \u201cmust demonstrate (1) error, (2) that is clear or obvious, and (3) that affects substantial rights.\u201d <em>Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d at 339. \u201cIf these conditions are met, this court may exercise its discretion to correct the error if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The district court\u2019s \u201cbrief\u2019 reasons for imposing the 262-month sentence were \u201clegally sufficient.\u201d <em>See Rita v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number><em>United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2469, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). Additionally, nothing in the record indicates that Leatch\u2019s sentence would have been different if the court had provided more explanation of its chose sentence. <em>See Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d at 363-64.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-4\">Leatch also contends that his sentence is substantively unreasonable because it was greater than needed to accomplish the goals of sentencing in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). He notes that his statements at sentencing reflect motivation and attempts to turn his life around and give up gangs and drug dealing. Leatch contends that the applicable advisory guidelines range is unnecessarily harsh and maintains that he is serving an effective life sentence, although he will be 43 at the time of his release from prison. The district court heal'd Leatch\u2019s and defense counsel\u2019s allocution about Leatch\u2019s positive actions in prison but elected to impose a sentence within the applicable guidelines range. The district court noted its satisfaction with the newly applicable advisory range resulting from the amendments to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c), which resolved the court\u2019s previously-stated disagreement with the ratio of cocaine base to powder cocaine. Leatch has not shown that the district court abused its discretion in selecting a sentence or, consequently, that the within-guidelines sentence imposed is unreasonable. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d at 338. Consequently, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b35-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
