Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). We review credibility determinations under the substantial-evidence test and must affirm the BIA\u2019s decision if it is \u201csupported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1286 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cThe trier of fact must determine credibility, and this court may not substitute its judgment ... with respect to credibility findings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Therefore, we will reverse \u201conly when the record compels a reversal; the mere fact that the record may support a contrary conclusion is not enough to justify a reversal.\u201d <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1027 (11th Cir.2004) <em>(en </em>banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">To be eligible for asylum \u201cthe [applicant] must, with credible evidence, establish (1) past persecution on account of [his] political opinion or any other protected ground, or (2) a \u2018well-founded fear\u2019 that [his] political opinion or any other protected ground will cause future persecution.\u201d <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1230-31 (quoting 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a), (b)). To qualify for withholding of removal, an applicant must establish that it is more likely than not \u201cthat his life or freedom would be threatened on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2003) (citing 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A)). The applicant bears the burden of proof in establishing his eligibility for asylum and withholding of removal. <em>See id.; </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(i). If an applicant cannot establish eligibility for asylum, he cannot meet the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1232-33.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-10\">An applicant\u2019s testimony, if credible, may carry his burden of proof without corroboration. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a). \u201cConversely, an adverse credibility determination alone may be sufficient to support the denial of an asylum application.\u201d <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287. An adverse credibility finding must be explicit. <em>Yang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>418 F.3d 1198, 1201 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cOnce an adverse credibility finding is made, the burden is on the applicant alien to show that the [BIA\u2019s] credibility decision was not supported by \u2018specific, cogent reasons\u2019 or was not based on substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287. \u201cIndications of reliable testimony include consistency on direct examination, consistency with the written application, and the absence of embellishments.\u201d <em>Ruiz v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1255 (11th Cir.2006). The REAL ID Act, which applies to applications such as Jumayev\u2019s filed after the date of its enactment, provides that an adverse-credibility determination can be based on ineonsis-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>tencies, inaccuracies, or falsehoods, regardless of whether they relate to the heart of an applicant\u2019s claim. Pub.L. No. 109-13, \u00a7 101(a)(3), (d), 119 Stat. 231, 303-05 (2005). Nevertheless, \u201can adverse credibility determination does not alleviate the [] duty to consider other evidence produced by an asylum applicant.\u201d <em>For-gue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287. In other words, the fact finder must consider all evidence introduced by the applicant. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">Upon review, we conclude that the BIA\u2019s adverse credibility determination was supported by substantial evidence because there were discrepancies in Jumayev\u2019s evidence. First, in his visa application, Ju-mayev listed Ulmas as his employer of ten year's. In his testimony, however, he omitted this information until confronted with it on cross-examination. Second, when asked about corroborating evidence, Ju-mayev initially stated that he was afraid to take the documents with him when he fled Uzbekistan, but later admitted that the documents did not exist. Third, in his asylum application, Jumayev wrote that he was detained for eight days, but in his testimony, he stated that it was seven days and at another point stated that he was tortured during his \u201csecond week\u201d of detention. Fourth, Jumayev testified that he applied for a visa because he was afraid and in pain due to his imprisonment in 2006, but when confronted with the fact that he had applied for the visa before his imprisonment, Jumayev testified that he did so as a result of bad memories from his mistreatment in 2005. During his testimony, however, Jumayev had stated that he had forgotten about the 2005 mistreatment. Finally, in his asylum application, Jumayev explained that he was told to leave the city when he was threatened in 2005, but in his testimony, he stated he was told to leave the country.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">Because the other evidence in the record does not compel a reversal of the BIA\u2019s adverse credibility determination, we deny Jumayev\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b632-7\">. Gulchekhra Dzhalilova proceeded as a derivative beneficiary. We refer to Jumayev, as the lead petitioner.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b632-11\">. Because Jumayev fails to offer any argument related to the denial of CAT relief, he has abandoned this issue. <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
