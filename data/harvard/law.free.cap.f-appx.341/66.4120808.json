He argues that the sentence is greater than necessary to meet the sentencing goals outlined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and specifically asserts that, in light of <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), the presumption of reasonableness does not apply to his sentence within the guideline range because the illegal reentry guideline, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, is flawed in that it is not supported by \u201cempirical data and national experience.\u201d Amaya-Rodas further asserts that the sentence fails to adequately account for his circumstances and motives and that the Sentencing Guidelines produce unwarranted sentencing disparities because of the random availability of \u201cfast track\u201d programs.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-22\">We have consistently rejected Amaya-Rodas\u2019s \u201cempirical data\u201d argument, concluding that <em>Kimbrough </em>does not question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>the presumption of reasonableness and does not require district or appellate courts to independently analyze the empirical grounding behind each individual guideline. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 530-31 (5th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 366-67 (5th Cir.2009). Amaya-Rodas has not rebutted the presumption that the district court sentenced him to a reasonable, properly calculated sentence within the guideline range. <em>See United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 338 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 328, 172 L.Ed.2d 236 (2008); <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554-55 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">As Amaya-Rodas concedes, the argument that his guidelines range was excessive because it resulted in an unwarranted disparity between defendants to whom the \u201cfast track\u201d program is available and those to whom it is not available is foreclosed by current circuit precedent. <em>See United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 563 (5th Cir.), cert. <em>denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 624, 172 L.Ed.2d 617 (2008). Accordingly, this court need not consider it further.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-9\">Amaya-Rodas has not shown that the 57-month sentence imposed by the district court was unreasonable. Because the sentence was within the advisory guideline range of 57 to 71 months of imprisonment, it is entitled to a presumption of reasonableness. <em>See, Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d at 554; <em>see also Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). The record demonstrates that the district court properly made an individualized assessment to determine whether a sentence within the guidelines range was sufficient but not greater than necessary to achieve the goals of \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See Rita, </em>127 S.Ct. at 2463. Amaya-Rodas has failed to rebut the presumption of reasonableness that this court applies to his sentence within the guideline range. <em>See Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d at 338; <em>see also Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d at 565-66. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b89-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
