He now appeals his conviction and sentence. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-20\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-21\">Williams appeals his conviction on the ground that the prosecutor\u2019s comments in closing argument to the jury were inappropriate and require reversal. We review a prosecutorial misconduct claim <em>de novo </em>because it is a mixed question of law and fact. <em>United States v. Eckhardt, </em>466 F.3d 938, 947 (11th Cir.2006). \u201cReversal on the basis of prosecutorial misconduct requires that the misconduct be so pronounced and persistent that it permeates the entire atmosphere of the trial.\u201d <em>United States v. Weinstein, </em>762 F.2d 1522, 1542 (11th Cir.1985) (quotation omitted), <em>modified in other respects on rehearing, </em>778 F.2d 673 (11th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>\u201cTo establish prosecutorial misconduct, \u2018(1) the remarks must be improper, and (2) the remarks must prejudicially affect the substantial rights of the defendant.\u2019 \u201d <em>Eckhardt, </em>466 F.3d at 947. (citation omitted). \u201cIn order to assess the prejudicial impact of a prosecutor\u2019s statements, we must evaluate them in the context of the trial as a whole and assess their probable impact on the jury.\u201d <em>United States v. Hernandez, </em>145 F.3d 1433, 1438 (11th Cir. 1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">To meet the substantial prejudice prong, the improper comments must have \u201cso infect[ed] the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process.\u201d <em>United States v. Eyster, </em>948 F.2d 1196, 1206 (11th Cir.1991) (quotation omitted). We have said that \u201c[a] defendant\u2019s substantial rights are prejudi-cially affected when a reasonable probability arises that, but for the remarks, the outcome of the trial would have been different.\u201d <em>Eckhardt, </em>466 F.3d at 947. \u201cA reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d <em>Eyster, </em>948 F.2d at 1207 (quotations and brackets omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">\u201c[A] prejudicial remark may be rendered harmless by curative instructions to the jury.\u201d <em>Weinstein, </em>762 F.2d at 1542; <em>see also United States v. Smith, </em>918 F.2d 1551, 1562 (11th Cir.1990) (stating \u201c[b]e-cause statements and arguments of counsel are not evidence, improper statements can be rectified by the district court\u2019s instruction to the jury that only the evidence in the case be considered\u201d). The jury is presumed to follow the court\u2019s jury instructions. <em>United States v. Stone, </em>9 F.3d 934, 940 (11th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">A direct reference to a defendant\u2019s failure to testify clearly violates the defendant\u2019s Fifth Amendment right against self incrimination, entitling him to a new trial, but an indirect reference to such failure is not reversible error <em>per se. United States v. Norton, </em>867 F.2d 1354, 1364 (11th Cir. 1989) (citing <em>Griffin v. California, </em>380 U.S. 609, 612-14, 85 S.Ct. 1229, 1232-33, 14 L.Ed.2d 106, 108 (1965)). Instead, the impact of the statement must be assessed in terms of the context in which it was made. <em>Norton, </em>867 F.2d at 1364. A comment will not be deemed an impermissible reference to a defendant\u2019s silence unless \u201c(1) it was the prosecutor\u2019s manifest intention to refer to the defendant\u2019s silence or (2) the remark was of such a character that the jury would \u2018naturally and necessarily\u2019 take it to be a comment on the defendant\u2019s silence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-9\">Although <em>Griffin </em>prohibits comments that suggest that a defendant\u2019s silence is \u201cevidence of guilt,\u201d a prosecutor\u2019s comments that concern a defendant\u2019s credibility as a witness are permissible, as this approach is \u201cin accord with [the] longstanding rule that when a defendant takes the stand, \u2018his credibility may be impeached and his testimony assailed like that of any other witness.\u2019 \u201d <em>Portuondo v. Agard, </em>529 U.S. 61, 69, 120 S.Ct. 1119, 1125, 146 L.Ed.2d 47 (2000) (citation omitted). \u201c[W]hen [a defendant] assumes the role of a witness, the rules that generally apply to other witnesses \u2014 rules that serve the truth-seeking function of the trial \u2014 are generally applicable to him as well.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation and quotation omitted). Additionally, it is not improper to comment on the failure of the defense, as opposed to the defendant, to counter or explain the evidence. <em>United States v. Chirinos, </em>112 F.3d 1089, 1100 (11th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-10\">Here, the prosecutor\u2019s remarks were not improper. One set of remarks focused on the defense\u2019s, rather than the defendant\u2019s, failure to counter or explain the evidence. Although the prosecutor also commented on Williams\u2019s failure to provide his version of events until after he heard all of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>evidence, it is not clear from the record that the prosecutor \u201cmanifestly intended\u201d to refer to Williams\u2019s silence, as the prosecutor could have been attacking his credibility as a witness. Moreover, the remarks were not of such a character that the jury would \u201cnaturally and necessarily\u201d take them as comments on Williams\u2019s right to remain silent, because Williams did testify, and the jury could have understood the comments as a challenge to his credibility. Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the prosecutor\u2019s statements were improper, the error was rendered harmless by the court\u2019s curative instructions, and, in light of the instructions, there is nothing to suggest that the jury improperly relied on the prosecutor\u2019s remarks.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">Williams argues that his sentence should be vacated because the court committed two procedural errors \u2014 in finding that he had two felony convictions, triggering application of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2), and in applying a two-level enhancement of his offense level for possessing a stolen firearm. We review a district court\u2019s interpretation of the Sentencing Guidelines <em>de novo, </em>and its factual findings for clear error. <em>United States v. Vance, </em>494 F.3d 985, 994 (11th Cir.2007). When the district court applies the Guidelines in an advisory manner, it is allowed to make additional factual findings, under a preponderance-of-the-evidence standard, that go beyond a defendant\u2019s admissions. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>480 F.3d 1277, 1281 (11th Cir.2007). The court\u2019s factual findings \u201cfor purposes of sentencing may be based on, among other things, evidence heard during trial, undisputed statements in the [presentence report], or evidence presented during the sentencing hearing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Additionally, official records are entitled to a presumption of i-egularity. <em>See Webster v. Estelle, </em>505 F.2d 926, 928-29 (5th Cir.1974) (pre-Guidelines habeas case).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">Section 2K2.1(a)(2) provides for a base offense level of 24 \u201cif the defendant committed any part of the instant offense subsequent to sustaining at least two felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2). The phrase \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d has the meaning given that term in \u00a7 4B 1.2(b) and application note 1 of the commentary to \u00a7 4B 1.2(b). U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2), comment (n.l).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-8\">Section 4B1.2(b) provides:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-9\">The term \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d means an offense under federal or state law, punishable by a term of imprisonment of more than one year, that prohibits the manufacture, import, export, distribution, or dispensing of a controlled substance (or a counterfeit substance) or the possession of a controlled substance (or a counterfeit substance) with intent to manufacture, import, export, distribute, or dispense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b624-10\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(b). Florida law, in turn, prohibits any person from selling, manufacturing, or delivering, or possessing with intent to sell, manufacture, or deliver cocaine. Fla.Stat. \u00a7 893.13(l)(a)(l). Such offense is punishable by up to 15 years in prison. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 893.1(l)(a)(l); <em>see also id. </em>\u00a7 775.082(3)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-11\">The Guidelines provide for an increase in a defendant\u2019s base offense level by two points if the offense involved a stolen firearm. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(4)(A). Knowledge that such a device is stolen property is not a prerequisite to the application of \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(4). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1, comment. (n. 8(B)) (stating that application of section 2K2.1(b)(4) applies \u201cregardless of whether the defendant knew or had reason to believe that the firearm was stolen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>.... \u201d); <em>see also United States v. Richardson, </em>8 F.3d 769, 770 (11th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">It is undisputed that Williams had one controlled substance conviction, a felony, and the documents submitted by the Government support the court\u2019s finding, under the preponderance-of-the-evidenee standard, that he was convicted of a second controlled substance offense. As a result, the court properly determined Williams\u2019s base offense level under \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2). Additionally, Williams\u2019s challenge to the firearms enhancement \u2014 that his lack of knowledge that the gun was stolen should render it inapplicable \u2014 is meritless and foreclosed by this court\u2019s precedent. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1, comment, (n. 8(B)); <em>Richardson, </em>8 F.3d at 770. Under the prior precedent rule, we are bound to follow binding precedent \u201cunless and until it is overruled by this court en banc or by the Supreme Court.\u201d <em>United States v. Brown, </em>342 F.3d 1245, 1246 (11th Cir. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
