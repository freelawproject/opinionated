Alvarado argues that the district court clearly erred in making an upward adjustment for obstruction of justice. He contends that the Government failed to provide evidence to corroborate a confidential source\u2019s (CS) statement that Alvarado threatened her when he discovered that she was carrying electronic monitoring equipment during a drug purchase.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-27\">For an obstruction-of-justice enhancement, the district court\u2019s factual findings are reviewed only for clear error. <em>United States v. Holmes, </em>406 F.3d 337, 363 (5th Cir.2005). \u201cA factual finding is not clearly erroneous as long as it is plausible in light of the record as a whole.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1012-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"990\">*990</page-number>Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1, a defendant\u2019s offense level should be increased by two levels if the defendant threatens, intimidates, or otherwise unlawfully influences a co-defendant directly or indirectly. \u00a7 3C1.1, comment. (n.4(a)). Although the Government was required to provide reliable evidence of intimidation, it was not required to provide independent corroborating evidence that the CS was threatened by Alvarado because the CS was a recognized coconspirator of Alvarado\u2019s and not an unidentified informant. <em>See </em>\u00a7 6A1.3, p.s., comment; <em>United States v. Rogers, </em>1 F.3d 341, 343-44 (5th Cir.1993). It could also be inferred that Alvarado\u2019s seizure of the bag after discovering it held electronic monitoring equipment constituted an act of intimidation, especially in light of Alvarado\u2019s well known reputation for violent behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-4\">The district court\u2019s decision to apply the adjustment for obstruction of justice was plausible in light of the record as a whole, and thus, did not constitute clear error. <em>See Holmes, </em>406 F.3d at 363.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-5\">The sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1011-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
