On appeal, Orellana argues that the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to support his conviction. In addition, Orellana identifies several potential trial errors, and. he argues that the cumulative effect of those errors deprived him of his Sixth Amendment right to a fair trial. First, he asserts that the district court erred by admitting evidence related to the purchase of the two rifles found in the package. Next, he argues that testimony by a government agent, Special Agent DeVito, regarding statements made by him and his wife in Spanish was impermissible hearsay because Agent DeVito testified that she was not fluent in Spanish, and explained that another agent had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>translated Orellana\u2019s statements for her. Orellana also asserts that admission of Agent DeVito\u2019s testimony violated his rights under the Confrontation Clause because the agent who translated his statements did not testify at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">In addition, Orellana argues that the prosecutor\u2019s cross-examination of his wife concerning an appraisal listing for the Or-ellanas\u2019 home and the prosecutor\u2019s comments during closing argument violated his constitutional rights. Finally, Orellana argues that the district court\u2019s jury instructions were erroneous because they failed to include all the <em>mens rea </em>elements of his offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>whether there is sufficient evidence in the record to support a jury\u2019s verdict in a criminal trial, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d <em>United States v. Beckles, </em>565 F.3d 832, 840 (11th Cir.2009). The test is whether \u201ca reasonable trier of fact could find that the evidence established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cIt is not necessary for the evidence to exclude every reasonable hypothesis of innocence or- be wholly inconsistent with every conclusion except that of guilt.\u201d <em>United States v. Garcia, </em>447 F.3d 1327, 1334 (11th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">In relevant part, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(e) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-8\">It shall be unlawful for any person knowingly to deliver or cause to be delivered to any common or contract carrier for transportation or shipment in interstate or foreign commerce, to persons other than licensed importers, licensed manufacturers, licensed dealers, or licensed collectors, any package or other container in which there is any firearm or ammunition without written notice to the carrier that such firearm or ammunition is being ... shipped.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Arz\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(e). In addition, the applicable penalty statute states that any person who \u201cwillfully violates\u201d various firearms statutes, including \u00a7 922(e), shall be fined, imprisoned for not more than five years, or both. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(a)(1)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-12\">The Supreme Court has interpreted the term \u201cwillfully,\u201d as used in \u00a7 924(a)(1)(D), to mean that the government must prove that the defendant knew that his conduct was unlawful. <em>Bryan v. United States, </em>524 U.S. 184, 196, 118 S.Ct. 1939, 1947, 141 L.Ed.2d 197 (1998). However, the government need not prove that the defendant was aware of the specific requirements of the particular statute. <em>Id. </em>at 191-195, 118 S.Ct. at 1944-47. The Court based its holding on \u201cthe traditional rule that ignorance of the law is no excuse.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 196, 118 S.Ct. at 1947. The Court distinguished earlier cases in which it had held that knowledge <em>of </em>the law is required <em>for </em>willful violations of certain tax and monetary transaction reporting statutes because those cases dealt with \u201chighly technical statutes that presented the danger of ensnaring individuals engaged in apparently innocent conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 194-195, 118 S.Ct. at 1946-47.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-13\">In <em>United States v. Granda, </em>565 F.2d 922 (5th Cir.1978),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we overturned a defendant\u2019s conviction for knowingly and willfully transporting monetary instruments in an amount exceeding $5,000 into the Unit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>ed States without filing a customs report because the government had failed to prove that the defendant was aware of the statute\u2019s reporting requirement. <em>Id. </em>at 923-27. In so holding, we observed that it was \u201cimpossible to prove beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d that a defendant willfully violated the statute without showing that the defendant was aware of the reporting requirement, because the isolated act of bringing more than $5,000 into the United States was \u201cnot illegal or even immoral.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 926.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">In order to establish that Orellana knowingly and willfully violated 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(e), the government was required to prove that Orellana knew that his conduct was unlawful, but it was not required to prove that he was aware of \u00a7 922(e)\u2019s notice requirement. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict, Orellana covered the rifles and ammunition with layers of packaging, and then informed the shipping company, Transportes Zuleta, that the box did not contain any rifles or ammunition. He listed \u201cLuis Fernando Cordon\u201d as the sender of the package, rather than using his own name. Based on this evidence, we conclude that a reasonable fact-finder could have concluded that Orellana knew that his conduct was unlawful. Further, we conclude that the government also introduced sufficient evidence to show that Orellana failed to give written notice to Transportes Zuleta.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">We review a district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings for a clear abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Brannan, </em>562 F.3d 1300, 1306 (11th Cir.2009). Under Rule 404(b),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-8\">Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b527-10\">Fed.R.Evid. 404(b). For evidence of a pri- or bad act to be admissible under Rule 404(b), it must meet three requirements. First, \u201cthe evidence must be relevant to an issue other than the defendant\u2019s character; [2] the act must be established by sufficient proof to permit a jury finding that the defendant committed the extrinsic act; and [3] the probative value of the evidence must not be substantially outweighed by its undue prejudice, and the evidence must meet the other requirements of Rule 403.\u201d <em>Brannan, </em>562 F.3d at 1307 (internal quotation marks omitted). With respect to the third requirement, we have stated that \u201cRule 403 is an extraordinary remedy which should be used only sparingly.\u201d <em>United States v. Betancourt, </em>734 F.2d 750, 757 (11th Cir.1984). A trial court may reduce the possibility of unfair prejudice through the use of a limiting instruction. <em>United States v. Edouard, </em>485 F.3d 1324, 1346 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-11\">In this case, the testimony by Orellana\u2019s cousin, Trabanino, that Orellana had asked him to purchase one of the rifles found in the package, and the forms that Trabanino and Orellana filled out when purchasing the rifles, indicated that Orellana was the owner of both rifles. The fact that Orella-na owned the rifles made it more likely that he knew that they were in the box. Thus, this evidence relating to the purchase of the rifles was relevant to the issue of knowledge. In addition, the probative value of this evidence was not outweighed by any unfair prejudice to Orellana. Therefore, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion by not excluding this evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">Because Orellana did not raise a hearsay or a Confrontation Clause challenge to Agent DeVito\u2019s testimony during his trial, we review this claim for plain error. Under the plain error standard, a defendant must show: (1) an error, (2) that is plain or obvious, and (3) that affected his substantial rights. <em>United States v. Jiminez, </em>564 F.3d 1280, 1286 (11th Cir.2009). If the first three conditions are met, we have discretion to correct an error that \u201cseriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">The Federal Rules of Evidence provide that a statement made by a party against whom it is offered is not hearsay. Fed. R.Evid. 801(d)(2)(A). Statements made by a party\u2019s agent or servant are also excluded from the definition of hearsay. Fed. R.Evid. 801(d)(2)(C) and (D). We have held that translations of a defendant\u2019s statements do not constitute impermissible hearsay where the translator was acting as the defendant\u2019s agent, and where the translator had sufficient capacity and no motive to mislead. <em>United States v. Alvarez, </em>755 F.2d 830, 859-60 (11th Cir.1985) (adopting the l\u2019easoning of <em>United States v. Da Silva, </em>725 F.2d 828 (2d Cir.1983)). \u201cPrior statements of witnesses are hearsay and are generally inadmissible as affirmative proof.\u201d <em>United States v. Khanani, </em>502 F.3d 1281, 1292 (11th Cir.2007) (internal quotation marks omitted). However, a witness\u2019s prior inconsistent statements are admissible for the purpose of impeachment. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">\u201c[T]he Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment prohibits the admission of out of court. statements that are testimonial unless the declarant is unavailable and the defendant had a previous opportunity to cross-examine the declarant.\u201d <em>Jiminez, </em>564 F.3d at 1286. \u201c[T]he Confrontation Clause prohibits <em>only </em>statements that constitute impermissible hearsay.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Admission of a defendant\u2019s own out-of-court statements does not violate the Confrontation Clause. <em>United States v. Brown, </em>441 F.3d 1330, 1358-59 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-8\">During Orellana\u2019s trial, Special Agent DeVito testified that, although she could not speak Spanish fluently, she did understand Spanish, and could understand \u201cportions or the majority of\u2019 Orellana\u2019s answers. In addition, the record does not indicate that Agent DeVito was unable to understand Anna Orellana\u2019s statements. Because it is not clear that Agent DeVito\u2019s testimony was based on Agent Cole\u2019s translations, Orellana cannqt show any plain error with respect to those translations.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-9\">To the extent that Special Agent DeVito\u2019s testimony was based on her own recollection, her testimony regarding Orellana\u2019s answers was not hearsay, because Orellana\u2019s responses were admissions by a party-opponent. In addition, admission of Orellana\u2019s own out-of-court statements did not violate the Confrontation Clause. Agent DeVito\u2019s testimony regarding Anna Orellana\u2019s statements was not hearsay because those statements were being used to impeach Anna Orellana\u2019s direct testimony, rather than being offered for the truth of. the matter asserted. Because Agent DeVito\u2019s testimony about Anna Orellana\u2019s statements was not impermissible hearsay, it also did not violate the Confrontation Clause. Therefore, we conclude that the district court did not commit plain error by not excluding Agent DeVito\u2019s testimony concerning the Orellanas\u2019 statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-10\">TV</p>\n<p id=\"b528-11\">Whether a prosecutor\u2019s statements during trial violated a defendant\u2019s constitu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>tional rights is a mixed question of law and fact that we review <em>de novo. United States v. Baker, </em>432 F.3d 1189, 1252 (11th Cir.2005). We will reverse a conviction based on a prosecutor\u2019s statements only where those statements: (1) were improper, and (2) prejudiced the defendant. <em>Id. </em>\u201cImproper statements prejudice the defendant when there is \u2018a reasonable probability that, but for the prosecutor\u2019s offending remarks, the outcome of the ... [proceeding] would have been different.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(alteration in original) (quoting <em>United States v. Eyster, </em>948 F.2d 1196, 1206 (11th Cir. 1991)).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">A. The Prosecutor\u2019s Questions Concerning the Appraisal Form</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">A party\u2019s questions on cross-examination must be supported by a good-faith factual basis. <em>See United States v. Foley, </em>508 F.3d 627, 637 (11th Cir.2007) (discussing standard for cross-examination of a character witness). Generally, documents must be properly authenticated or identified before being admitted into evidence. Fed.R.Evid. 901(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">At trial, Orellana\u2019s defense was that a former tenant had given him the package for shipment, and that he did not know that there were rifles and firearms inside of the package. Orellana\u2019s wife, Anna Orellana, testified that this tenant stayed in a third bedroom in the Orellanas\u2019 home. On cross-examination, the prosecutor asked Anna Orellana whether she knew that her home had been appraised as a two-bedroom home.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">Because the prosecutor had a copy of a Miami-Dade County property appraisal listing, he had a good-faith basis for asking this question. Because the government did not introduce the appraisal into evidence, no authentication was required. Also, it does not appear that the prosecutor\u2019s question resulted in any prejudice to Orellana, as it is unlikely that this question had a significant impact on the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-10\">B. The Prosecutor\u2019s Remarks During Closing Argument</p>\n<p id=\"b529-11\">Although \u201ca prosecutor may not comment on the absence of witnesses or otherwise attempt to shift the burden of proof, ... a comment by the prosecutor on the failure by defense counsel, as opposed to the defendant, to counter or explain evidence\u201d is permissible. <em>United States v. Hernandez, </em>145 F.3d 1433, 1439 (11th Cir. 1998). Any prejudice resulting from a burden-shifting is reduced if the government or the trial court explains to the jury that the government has the burden of proof. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b529-12\">Generally, a prosecutor may not express his personal opinion concerning a defendant\u2019s guilt. <em>See United States v. Tisdale, </em>817 F.2d 1552, 1556 (11th Cir.1987); <em>United States v. Young, </em>470 U.S. 1, 18-19, 105 S.Ct. 1038, 1048, 84 L.Ed.2d 1 (1985). However, a prosecutor may express a personal opinion provided that it is based on evidence in the record. <em>United States v. Adams, </em>799 F.2d 665, 670 (11th Cir.1986) (\u201cI believe that the Government has proven ... that the Defendants are guilty\u201d held to be a permissible comment on the weight of the evidence); <em>see also Tisdale, </em>817 F.2d at 1556 (no reversible error where prosecutor stated \u201cI believe the government has proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-13\">We conclude from the record that the prosecutor\u2019s remark during closing argument that he had not seen any pictures of the third bedroom was not an improper burden-shifting argument, but rather, was a comment on defense counsel\u2019s failure to introduce photographs of the third bedroom. Even if this remark <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>were improper, it does not appear that it prejudiced Orellana, because the government and the district court both stated to the jury that the government had the burden of proving each element of Orellana\u2019s offense beyond a reasonable doubt. In addition, the prosecutor\u2019s comment, \u201cI know it,\u201d when read in context, was a comment on the weight of the evidence rather than a personal opinion of Orella-na\u2019s guilt. Therefore, that remark was not improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">In a case where a defendant objects to the district court\u2019s jury instructions for the first time on appeal, we review for plain error. <em>United States v. Dean, </em>517 F.3d 1224, 1230 (11th Cir.2008), cert. <em>denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 2155, 173 L.Ed.2d 1158 (2009). The Eleventh Circuit Pattern Jury Instructions, used by the district court in this case, state that an act was done \u201cknowingly\u201d if it \u201cwas done voluntarily and intentionally and not because of mistake or accident.\u201d 11th Cir. Pattern Jury Instr. (Criminal Cases) \u00a7 9.1 (2003). The pattern jury instructions define the term \u201cwillfully\u201d to mean that \u201cthe act was committed voluntarily and purposely, with the specific intent to do something that the law forbids; that is, with bad purpose either to disobey or disregard the law.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">In <em>United States v. Mekjian, </em>505 F.2d 1320 (5th Cir.1975), the defendant was charged with filing false Medicare claims, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001. <em>Id. </em>at 1322. The relevant statutory language made it illegal to \u201cknowingly\u201d and \u201cwillfully\u201d file a false claim, but the indictment only charged Mekjian with \u201cknowingly\u201d filing false claims. <em>Id. </em>at 1324. We held that the indictment was invalid because it failed to include the mens rea element of \u201cwillfully.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We noted that \u201cknowingly\u201d and \u201cwillfully\u201d were distinct <em>mens rea </em>elements because \u201cknowingly\u201d only required proof that the defendant acted \u201cwith knowledge,\u201d whereas \u201cwillfully\u201d required proof that the defendant acted \u201cdeliberately and with knowledge.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1324 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-9\">In this case, because the government was not statutorily required to show that Orellana was specifically aware of \u00a7 922(e)\u2019s notice requirement, the district court did not err, much less plainly err, by not instructing the jury that the government needed to prove that Orellana \u201cknowingly\u201d and \u201cwillfully\u201d failed to provide written notice. In addition, although the court omitted the <em>mens rea </em>element of \u201cknowingly\u201d from its jury instructions, this omission did not affect Orellana\u2019s substantial rights because the definition of \u201cwillfully\u201d used by the district court essentially includes the definition of \u201cknowingly.\u201d An act that is performed \u201cvoluntarily and purposely\u201d is also done \u201cvoluntarily and intentionally and not because of mistake or accident.\u201d <em>See </em>11th Cir. Pattern Jury Instr. \u00a7 9.1. Thus, we conclude that Orellana has failed to show any plain error with respect to the district court\u2019s jury instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-10\">Because Orellana has not shown any error, he has also failed to show cumulative error. Accordingly, we affirm Orella-na\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b526-9\">. In <em>Bonner v.
