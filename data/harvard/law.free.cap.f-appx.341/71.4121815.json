Liu argues that she fears future persecution, and thus is entitled to withholding of removal, because the birth of her second child places her in violation of China\u2019s population control'policy. Liu has failed to show that the Changle City family planning handbook and administrative opinion she adduced were more persuasive than documents produced by the United States State Department regarding the situation in China. <em>See Rojas v. INS, </em>937 F.2d 186, 190 n. 1 (5th Cir.1991). Nor do the documents provide specific evidence regarding the probability of future persecution of Liu on the basis of her foreign-born children. <em>See Matter of S-Y-G, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 247, 255 (BIA 2007). Liu\u2019s own equivocal testimony and that of her aunt-by-marriage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>were insufficient to show that Liu would be subject to either physical force or other enforcement measures \u201cof sufficient severity that it amounts to persecution.\u201d <em>See Zhu v. Gonzales, </em>493 F.3d 588, 600 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">Liu\u2019s evidence was not \u201c \u2018so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u2019 \u201d <em>See Jukic v. INS, </em>40 F.3d 747, 749 (5th Cir.1994) (quoting <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992)). Liu has consequently not shown that the evidence compels a conclusion contrary to the BIA\u2019s rejection of her claims. <em>See Carbajal-Gonzalez v. INS, </em>78 F.3d 194, 197 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">Liu\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b93-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
