Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). In this case, the BIA issued its own decision. Factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations, are reviewed under the highly deferential substantial evidence test. <em>Chen v. U.S. Atty. Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1228, 1230-31 (11th Cir.2006). Under this test, we must affirm the BIA\u2019s decision if it is \u201csupported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1284. \u201cTo reverse a factual finding by the BIA, this Court must find not only that the evidence supports a contrary conclusion, but that it compels one.\u201d <em>Farquharson v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>246 F.3d 1317, 1320 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-16\">Hernandez-Quintero and Velasquez argue the IJ erroneously cited minor omissions and inconsistencies in their application and Hernandez-Quintero\u2019s testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>as the basis for his adverse credibility finding. In light of their explanations for the inconsistencies, petitioners claim the IJ\u2019s determination was not based on substantial evidence, and the evidence compels the conclusion he testified credibly. Hernandez-Quintero and Velasquez also argue they met the statutory requirements for asylum and withholding of removal through Hernandez-Quintero\u2019s testimony and the record evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\">To be eligible for asylum, the applicant must, \u201cwith specific and credible evidence,\u201d establish past persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of a protected ground. <em>Chen, </em>463 F.3d at 1231. \u201cIndications of reliable testimony include consistency on direct examination, consistency with the written application, and the absence of embellishments.\u201d <em>Ruiz v. U.S. Atty. Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1255 (11th Cir. 2006). \u201cAn adverse credibihty determination does not alleviate the IJ\u2019s duty to consider other evidence produced by an asylum applicant .... [and, if] the applicant produces other evidence of persecution, whatever form it may take, the IJ must consider that evidence.\u201d <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1287 (11th Cir.2005). The weaker the applicant\u2019s testimony, the greater the need for corroborating evidence. <em>Yang v. U.S. Atty. Gen., </em>418 F.3d 1198, 1201 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">\u201cOnce an adverse credibihty finding is made, the burden is on the applicant alien to show that the IJ\u2019s credibihty decision was not supported by specific, cogent reasons or was not based on substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287. \u201c[T]his Court may not substitute its judgment for that of the [BIA] with respect to credibihty findings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1286. Even if an applicant provides \u201ctenable\u201d explanations concerning the \u201cimplausible aspects of his claim,\u201d it does not compel finding the BIA\u2019s credibihty determination was not supported by substantial evidence, particularly where the applicant does not provide corroborating evidence. <em>Chen, </em>463 F.3d at 1233. A petitioner necessarily fails to meet the higher standard for withholding of removal when he fails to establish eligibility for asylum. <em>Djonda v. U.S. Atty. Gen., </em>514 F.3d 1168, 1177 (11th Cir.2008). In addition, \u201cthere are no derivative benefits associated with a grant of withholding of removal.\u201d <em>Delgado v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>487 F.3d 855, 862 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">In this case, the record does not compel a conclusion contrary to that of the BIA. The BIA supported its adverse credibihty finding with specific, cogent reasons, citing Hernandez-Quintero\u2019s inconsistent testimony and his lack of corroborating evidence. <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287. As noted by the BIA, Hernandez-Quintero gave inconsistent accounts regarding his car accident and whether he subsequently sought medical care. Additionally, although Hernandez-Quintero argues any errors in his application were the result of his reliance on a notary public, he had nearly three years to review the application and never supplemented it or noted any inaccuracies in the hearing. Hernandez-Quintero\u2019s explanations for the inconsistencies and errors do not compel the conclusion the BIA\u2019s adverse credibihty finding was not supported by substantial evidence. <em>Chen, </em>463 F.3d at 1233. Furthermore, in light of the lack of corroborating evidence directly related to Hernandez-Quintero\u2019s participation in Venezuelan politics or that he was attacked based on that involvement, the BIA\u2019s adverse credibihty finding was sufficient to dismiss his petition. <em>See Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287. Finally, Hernandez-Quintero\u2019s failure to establish eligibility for asylum means he also failed to establish eligibility for withholding of removal, <em>see Djonda, </em>514 F.3d at 1177, and, regardless, withholding of removal would not be available to Velasquez as a derivative beneficiary, <em>see Delgado, </em>487 F.3d at 862.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">Hernandez-Quintero and Velasquez next argue the BIA abused its discretion in denying their motion to remand, in which they sought to introduce: (1) the United States Department of State Venezuela Country Report on Human Rights Practices (Country Report) for 2007; (2) a statement from the president of the Venezuelan political party in which Hernandez-Quintero claimed membership; and (3) a medical report stating Hernandez-Quinte-ro was seen in a hospital on April 18, 2003, for traveling purposes, and he was suffering from pain resulting from a car accident. Petitioners claim the BIA erroneously found they did not apply the facts contained in the Country Report to their case, and ignored their explanation that they could not obtain the documents before them hearing. They also argue the BIA did not provide a rational explanation in denying the motion, especially because the new documents bolstered Hernandez-Quintero\u2019s credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">The substance of a motion to remand determines how we review it on appeal. <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1301. We treat a motion to remand as part of the petitioner\u2019s appeal to the BIA if the motion merely articulates the remedy requested by the appeal. <em>Id. </em>On the other hand, when a motion to remand seeks to introduce evidence not previously presented, the motion is generally treated as a motion to reopen. <em>Id. </em>We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for an abuse of discretion. <em>Id. </em>at 1302.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">The \u201cAttorney General has \u2018broad discretion\u2019 to grant or deny such motions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A motion to reopen may be granted if the alien presents new evidence that is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the removal hearing. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.23(b)(3). The movant has the \u201cheavy burden\u201d of presenting evidence which would likely change the result in the case. <em>Ali v. U.S. Atty. Gen., </em>443 F.3d 804, 813 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-8\">Here, we treat Hernandez-Quintero\u2019s and Velasquez\u2019s motion to remand as a motion to reopen because it sought to introduce new evidence. HernandezQuintero\u2019s motion sought to introduce three new items, as noted above. The 2007 Country Report was largely consistent with the 2005 and 2006 Country Reports, and he has not explained why he was unable to procure the political affidavit or the new medial report before his asylum hearing. Furthermore, he submitted medical reports documenting the same injury before the hearing. Because the evidence they sought to offer was either not likely to change the outcome of the case or not previously unavailable, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion. Accordingly, Hernandez-Quintero\u2019s and Velasquez\u2019s petition for review is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-9\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b566-12\">. Hernandez-Quintero and Velasquez do not raise any challenge in their brief to the denial of CAT relief, and therefore abandoned the issue. <em>See Ruiz v. U.S. Atty. Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1256 11. 6 (11th Cir.2006) (holding that an appellant abandons an issue when he or she fails to argue it on appeal).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
