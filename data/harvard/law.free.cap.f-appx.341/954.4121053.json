He argues that the sentence is greater than necessary to meet the sentencing goals outlined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and specifically asserts that, in light of <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), the presumption of reasonableness does not apply to his within-guidelines sentence because U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, the guideline provision applicable to violations of \u00a7 1326, is flawed in that it is not supported by \u201cempirical data and national experience.\u201d Lopez additionally contends that the Sentencing Guidelines produce unwarranted sentencing disparities because of the random availability of \u201cfast track\u201d programs.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-23\">This court has consistently rejected Lopez\u2019s \u201cempirical data\u201d argument, concluding that <em>Kimbrough </em>does not question the presumption of reasonableness and does not require district or appellate courts to independently analyze the empirical grounding behind each individual guideline. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 530 (5th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 366-67 (5th Cir.2009), <em>petition for cert. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"955\">*955</page-number><em>filed </em>(June 24, 2009) (No. 08-11099). Lopez has not rebutted the presumption that the district court sentenced him to a reasonable, properly calculated within-guidelines sentence. <em>See United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 338 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 328, 172 L.Ed.2d 236 (2008); <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554-55 (5th Cir. 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b977-7\">As Lopez concedes, the argument that his sentence was unreasonable because it resulted in an unwarranted disparity between defendants to whom the \u201cfast track\u201d program is available and those to whom it is not available is foreclosed by current circuit precedent. <em>United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 563 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 624, 172 L.EdUd 617 (2008). Accordingly, this court need not consider it further.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-10\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b976-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
