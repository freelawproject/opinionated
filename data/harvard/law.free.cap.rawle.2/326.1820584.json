The plaintiffs tendered to the defendants no deed or other writing, relating to the sale of the 14th of <em>June. </em>The defendants did not 'd\u00e9posit the one hundred 'dollars, nor insure the property, nor pay any money, nor offer to pay any. <em>John Northrop </em>did not pay the one hundred dollars, but was sued, and judgment recovered against him for that sum, in suit'No. <em>456, </em>to <em>September </em>Term, 1824.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-9\">The plaintiffs advertised .the property for sale on the 9th of <em>December, </em>1824, on account of the default of the former purchasers, and at their risk and expense, and sold it to <em>John Dickinson </em>for one thousand three hundred dollars. The expens.es of the resale were sixty-six, dollars .and ninety-two cents. The jury found a verdict for the plaintiffs for four hundred and fifty dollars, if the.court should'be of opinion, in point of law on the above facts, that they could recover that sum; if not, for the plaintiffs for one hundred and sixty-six dollars and ninety-two cents. The court entered judgment for this latter sum.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-10\">The plaintiffs stated, and filed in writing, that they had'always considered the judgmentagainst <em>Northrop,&amp;s </em>a security for so much, and agreeing to release the same on the,.pay\u2019men.t of four hundred and fifty dollars, with interest and costs of suit. The plaintiffs brought this writ of error, and assigned for error, that judgment ought . to have been entered for the larger sum. The plaintiffs\u2019 counsel contended, that it was legal to advertise on th\u00e9se terms: That on failing to comply with the terms, thp difference should be paid by the bidder: That the purchasers having agreed to this, the difference between the first and last sale, were stipulated damages: That the second agreement was not a relinquishment of this part of the conditions of the first sale: That the change of the terms was only to make it conform, as far as possible, to the terms.of the first; and-that the conduct of the defendants shpwed, their last agreement was only, a fraud on the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-11\">There was a time, when the penalty in a bond, or article of agreement, was said to be stipulated damages, and was so at law. Chancery Courts, and chancery powers were for a long time founded on, and supported by the necessity of relieving from this. I do not say, that any agreement, or any device, or form of sale, or of contract, does or can exist, which in any well regulated government, will have the effect, in all cases, here contended for. If a bond, an article of agreement under seal, or a mortgage, all of which once had this effect, and all of which are as positive in.their terms as language can be, and are as solemn instruments as men can execute, have not this effect, and experience has proved the absolute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>necessity of relief from.their terms,'and they now only produce justice according, to the facts and circumstances of the case; it is not easy to give a good reason why less solemn instruments, or .parol contracts, should be, in law, different; but it is not necessary to decide the matter in this case. If this condition could be binding, the second sale must not be clogged with .any terms likely to lower the price; and I am not prepared to say, that'the clause in the conditions of the second sale, that the balance should be secured by a bond, and a <em>warrant of </em>attorney, and mortgage, which must mean a warrant of attorney to confess judgment, was not an essential variance of the terms of sale likely to deter' bidders, to lessen the price; but I do not go on that either. The agreement of-the 14th of June, was a private, not a public sale. Its terms are as plain as words can make them, and except,' as to price, are in all respects different from those of the first sale, and from those'set up as the terms of the second public sale. The sums payable, and times of payment, are different; the insurance of the property is different; no resale is \u2022mentioned, but an absolute forfeiture is agreed on, and security is required and given; in short, it was an entirely-new and distinct contract. The words, \u201c <em>agree to take theproperty at their former purchase, of one thousand seven hundred and.fifty </em>dollars,\u201d are not the contract, but part of the contract, modified by every word which follows. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">We cannot, in this case, consider this second contract as a'fraud, for it is not so found in the special verdict; and the facts do not warrant the inference, if we could draw one of that kind.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">Every contract-may be waived, or varied by the parties to it. When a first contract is declared by a party to be at an end, as the first sale was. here by the second advertisement, the parties may still come to another agreement, When the new agreement is in itself complete, contains precise stipulations as to what shall be the effect, on certain contingencies, and these effects are to be different from what was stipulated by the contract which had been declared void, I know of no rule of law, or reason, which will justify a- court \u2022in saying, that, all the terms of the first agreement are still in- force, and that the latter agreement is only cumulative. If this were said, nothing could- be so unsafe as to enter into new articles with one \u25a0who had before contracted. Why was not the first agreement complied with ? Who refused to complete it? The defendants.' Why did they make a new agreement? To get different and better terms. But if the plaintiffs\u2019 construction is adopted, this can never be. I am of opinion, the second was an entirely new agreement: -That the defendants are bound by it, and not by the first, and that the judgment of the District Court was right.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
