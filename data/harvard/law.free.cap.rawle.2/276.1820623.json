Previous to this, to wit: on the 24th of <em>June, </em>1828, <em>Scheerer </em>had given notice to <em>Stanley, </em>that he, <em>Scheerer, </em>had become the purchaser of the property at sheriff\u2019s sale, and claimed a proportion <em>of </em>the rent, (o be calculated from the 23d of <em>June, </em>1828.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b277-8\">The question for the opinion of the court is, whether the plash-tiff be entitled to recover from the defendant the whole, or any, and what part of the quarter\u2019s rent which became due on the 20th of <em>Jiugust, </em>1828.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b277-9\">If the opinion of the court should be in favour of the plaintiff^ judgment to be entered for him accordingly, for such sum as the court shall direct; if the opinion of the court should be in favour of the defendant, judgment to be entered for him.

If judgment ought not to have been entered for the plaintiff of the whole of the quarter\u2019s rent, then judgment ought to have been rendered for him for such proportion of it as became due from the day of sale till the 20th of <em>Jiugust, </em>1828.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b277-14\"><em>T. S. Smith, </em>for the plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AFd\">observed, that the purchaser at sheriff\u2019s sale became the landlord from the day of sale, the deed having a retrospective operation. In contemplation of law, he pays the money at that time, and is, therefore, entitled to rent by way of compensation for the loss of interest on the purchase money. In <em>Hawk </em>v. <em>Stouch, </em>5 <em>Serg. &amp; </em>Rawle, 157, it was decided, that a purchaser at sheriff\u2019s sale, cannot give notice to the person in possession, so as to ground a proceeding, under the act of assembly of the 6th of <em>Jlpril, </em>1802, before the acknowledgment of the sheriff\u2019s deed; yet, the judge who delivered the opinion of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>court, distinctly says, that after acknowledgment, the rights of the purchaser relate back to the time of sale. \u25a0</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b278-5\"><em>W. M. Meredith, </em>for the defendant in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AvP\">answered, that the general principle was clearly in favour of his client. Here the purchaser had not paid his money at the day the property was struck off to him; and, consequently, the ground upon which he puts his claim fails. The <em>notice he </em>gave was, that he should claim a proportional part of the rent accruing after the day of sale, instead of which, he now claims the whole quarter\u2019s rent. In <em>Hawk </em>v. <em>Stouch, </em>5 <em>Serg. </em>&amp; <em>Rawle, </em>157, the case referred to on <em>the </em>opposite side, the term sale, was held to mean the completion of the sale, by the acknowledgment of the sheriff\u2019s deed.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b278-6\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b278-7\">Gibson, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"A9NB\">\u2014 On receiving the sheriff\u2019s deed, the title of the purchaser may, for some purposes, be referred to what is popularly called the sale; and there is a <em>dictum </em>to that effect in the opinion of the court in <em>Hawk </em>v. <em>Stouch, 5 Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>157. It was, however, ruled in that case, that he cannot previously give notice to quit, for the purpose of founding a proceeding to recover the possession; and it seems as clear, that he cannot give notice of his purchase to entitle himself, to the rent. It is expressly declared, that he shall be substituted for the landlord, only when he shall have\u2019received the deed; and this declaration must have been intended to qualify the subsequent clauses, as it would be incongruous to entitle him to rent which accrued before the relation of landlord and tenant was established. In designating the period from which he is to be entitled, the framers of the law undoubtedly use the words, \u201c subsequent to such sale.\u201d But the contract with the sheriff, being imperfect before it has had the sanction of the court, is in law, and in fact, no sale at all. If the purchaser were entitled to rent due before the acknowledgment of the deed, he would necessarily be allowed to warn the tenant to retain it in the mean time: yet, the legislature seems not to have contemplated notice of a doubtful right, or one depending on a contingency. It would seem, therefore, that the title of the purchaser is but co-extensive with his character of landlord, which is expressly limited to com-menee at the acknowledgment of the deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">Judgment affirmed-</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
