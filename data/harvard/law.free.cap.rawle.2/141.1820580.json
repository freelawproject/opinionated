J.</author>\n<p id=\"AYkj\">\u2014 The presumption, that a warrant o| location, is for the use of the person in whose name it w\u2019as taken out, may be rebutted by slight evidence; and, on the other hand, a trust, presumed from the relation in which the person whose name is used, stands to another, may be rebutted by evidence equally, slight \u2014 - .even by the reputation of the country. The ownership majt be set-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>tied by evidence that would be incompetent to settle anything else. The paper which is the subject of exception, purports to bo a memorandum of instructions, received in a course of official duty, in relation to warrants in the hands of the deputy surveyor, as the property of <em>Samuel Blythe; </em>and, among the rest,one in thename of <em>.John M\u2018Connel, </em>on which, it would appear, the deputy had been instructed to return a survey, made on a warrant in <em>Blythe\u2019s </em>own name. \u25a0 The rest relates to other warrants that were to be certified as unsatisfied, to entitle <em>Blythe </em>to the amount of the purchase money in land office credits. The object, therefore, was, to prove that <em>Blythe </em>was the owner ipf the warrant in the name of ikf\u2018 <em>Connel, </em>under whom the defendant had pretended to claim. The acts'of a deputy surveyor, preparatory to the consummation of his duty, such as his field notes, are unquestionably admissible as part of the <em>res gestee; </em>and to prove them, it has been aptly said, even the sweepings of his office are evidence. In <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Stoner, </em>the survey and endorsement in the hand-writing of the deputy, were held void in the absence of proof of their haying been ihade in pursuance of a previous authority; and they were- deemed incompetent to prove the existence of such an authority, because, on the proof of that fact d\u00e9pended' the question, whether they had been made in a*course of official duty; and the admission of them to prove it, would have been an assumption-of the question. Here there is no doubt of the existence of an authority to give the deputy cognizance; and ,as the noting of the instructions was not only in the course of his duty, but necessary fo a faithful discharge of it, the act was clearly of an official stamp: so that showing the footsteps of the parties, and having been found in the office of the deputy, after a period of forty years from his death, the paper was incontestably competent.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">Judgment affirmed*. \u25a0</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
