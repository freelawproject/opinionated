The proceedings before the justice were conceived by the defendant, <em>Henry Frick, </em>to be erroneous, and he took out a <em>Certiorari, </em>to remove them to this court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b20-12\"><em>Marr, </em>on behalf of the defendant below, now moved to quash the writ, on the ground, that this court had no jurisdiction, and referred to the twenty-fourth section of the act of assembly of the 20th of March, 1810. <em>Purd. </em>Dig\u201e 459..</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b20-13\">\n<em>J.

It is a species of attachment to compel the owner to appear and make satisfaction for trespass committed by his cattle; and, after appearance had, if satisfaction be not tendered and accepted, the proceeding assumes the ordinary form of an action <em>inter partes, </em>the justice giving judgment according to the limit of his jurisdiction, and issuing execution for the damages, and the defendant having the benefit of stay of execution and'appeal, as in other cases. The case of the <em>Fourteen Hogs, </em>10 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>393, which is .cited in support of the writ, passed,\u2019as to the present question, <em>sub </em>si<em>lentio; </em>and, <em>M'Call </em>v. <em>Lenox, </em>9 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>302, was the case of an inquisition before <em>two </em>justices; in which respect, it is essentially different from the case at bar, which falls within both the letter and the spirit of the prohibition.</p>\n<p id=\"b21-4\"><em>Certiorari </em>quashed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
