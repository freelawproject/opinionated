A <em>Liberari Facias </em>was issued to <em>November </em>Term, 1824, and <em>Alexander Graham </em>was put into possession. . In <em>January, </em>1825, he leased the premises to <em>George Barnhart, </em>for one year, from the 1st of <em>April, </em>1825, at the yearly rent of fifty dollars, payable quarterly.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b78-14\">On the 30th of <em>April, </em>1825, the <em>Liberari Facias </em>was set aside by the court, and restitution awarded, but not actually made. <em>Graham </em>had received twenty-five dollars, two quarters\u2019 rent'; and afterwards, by an endorsement on the l\u00e9ase, authorized <em>John Painter </em>to collect, and receive the balance. <em>Painter </em>distrained upon <em>Barnhart\u2019s </em>property, for two quarters\u2019 rent. . It appeared,.that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number><em>Mary Barnhart, </em>by her next friend, <em>George Barnhart, </em>had brought a suit against <em>Lott Corson, </em>to <em>January </em>Term, 1824, and had obtained judgment against him; and,- on the 12th of <em>January, 1826,\u25a0 George Barnhart </em>was put into possession, on a <em>Liberari Facias </em>issued on that judgment. <em>Lott Corson </em>had died on the 2d of <em>October, </em>1824. <em>Mary Barnhart\u2019s </em>execution was never set aside. \u2022</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b79-4\">The replevin was brought to <em>August </em>Term, 1826. On the 2d of <em>June, </em>1.826, the defendants entered a rule of reference; and the arbitrators, on the 29th of <em>July, </em>returned an \"award in favour of the plaintiff for seven dollars damages, with costs. - On the 17th of <em>August, </em>a paper was filed, signed by the defendants\u2019 attorney, stating, that the distress and rent were for the use of <em>John Painter, </em>administrator of <em>Lott Corson, </em>and that <em>Painter </em>would appeal, Without paying costs, and, on the same day he made-affidavit, and appealed. On the 22d.day of <em>August </em>a rule was granted, to show cause why the appeal should not be dismissed, which was afterwards made absolute; but, on the 17th- of <em>April, </em>1827, the rule\" was rescinded; and, on the same day, <em>Painter </em>avowed, and <em>Caul </em>made cognizance for rent in arrear on <em>Graham\u2019s </em>lease, assigned, as they averred, by <em>Graham </em>to Painter,,and claimed rent from- the 1st of <em>October, </em>1825, to the 1st of <em>October, </em>1826. .On the avowry was <em>endorsed </em>as <em>follows: </em>\u2014 John <em>Painter </em>suggests, that the rent is, and was claimed for the use of the creditors of <em>Lott Corson, </em>deceased, of whom he is administrator <em>de bonis non, </em>&amp;c.

The CouRT-erred in telling the jury, that the only question .-which remains is, \u2018 <em>whether John Painter, </em>as administrator of <em>Lott Corson, </em>could recover this rent for the payment of the debts of <em>Corson. </em>If the jury believed there was not personal estate sufficient for the payment \"of <em>Corson\u2019s, </em>debts, lands and tenements,.as well as goods and chattels, are considered assets for the payment of debts. In that case, the administrator would have a right to collect the rents due the deceased, and appropriate th.em to the payment of the debts. The general principle is, that administrators cannot meddle with \u25a0 the proceeds of real estate, but the case is altered when there is not sufficient real and personal estate for the payment of the debts. How it was in this case, the jury, can determine from.the evidence.\u2019 \u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b79-9\"><em>Greenough, </em>for the plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A4f\">insisted, that the appeal;. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>which was at first\"properly struck off; ought not to have been reinstated. But, without resting upon the error of thus replacing if, as it was argued in the court below, that the first decision had been given without hearing the opposite party, he contended, that the appeal should never have been, admitted. The distress was made by <em>Painter </em>in the character of assignee of the lessor, and the rule of arbitration is taken out by him in that capacity. When the proceedings return to the court, he drops the character of assignee, and assumes that of administrator; contending, that as such, he may appeal, without paying-costs. The allowance of the appeal was erroneous. \"</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b80-4\">The charge of the court was erroneous in the instances pointed out in the assignment of errors. Whether an-.estate is indebted or not, the administrator is not entitled to receive the rents accruing after the death'of the intestate. This principle is too clear to require the support of authorities. \u2022 \u2022</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b80-5\">\n<em>Bellas, contra,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A7L\">answered, thatit.appeared from the evidence, that after the death of <em>Corson, Barnhart, </em>when called on by <em>Painter, </em>agreed to pay to him the rent, and this must be considered.as a new demise'. The general principle will not apply if a new lease is thus created; and the administrator, when he-'receives the rent upon it, will be bound to account to the creditors, and, therefore, may justify the distress by virtue of it. If the pleadings were disregarded on the trial, and evidence given of a. parol lease, w\u00e9 ought not now to go back to the pleadings, and try the causeon them. If objections had been made on the trial, we would have amended the pleadings.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b80-6\">But <em>Greenough, </em>as to the agreement, asserted to have been made <em>by Barnhart, </em>referred to the evidence to show, that <em>Barnhart </em>was, at that-time, ignorant that the <em>Liberari Facias </em>had been set aside, and as soon- as he was acquainted with the true state of the facts, he refused to pay either <em>Graham </em>or <em>Painter.</em></p>\n<opinion data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b80-7\">Smith, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Aa0\">(after stating the principal facts, the pleadings, and the charge of the court below,) delivered the opinion of the court as follows: \u2014 The instruction given to the jury was erroneous. On the issue-of no rent in arrear, the question to be tried was, whether <em>Alexander Graham </em>had a right to demand rent? To me it appears very evident, he had no such right. His claim was founded solely upon his writ of <em>Liberari Facias </em>to <em>November </em>Term, .1824. If this execution had not beenissued, <em>Alexander Graham </em>would not have had possession; and When, therefore; it was set aside, and'restitution awarded, he not- only lost all claim to the rent, subsequently accruing, but could have been compelled to restore to <em>Lott Carson, </em>if he had been living, or to his heirs, if.he were dead, the rent he had received. . His right was then, founded on the execution, and, therefore, when that was gone, his-claim to rent was gone also. This, too, seems to have been taken for granted, by the judge who tried the cause, for, in his charge, he says, \u201cUnder that lease <em>John </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number><em>Painter </em>was not' entitled to receive, rent.\u201d But this was the very question then trying, for it was under this.lease, that <em>Painter </em>set up his claim to the rent; it is set out by him in his avowry at large, and it is on .this lease, the plaintiff replied, there was no rent in arrear. I am then decidedly of opinion, no rent was, due to <em>Alexander </em>Graham, when he authorized <em>John Painter, </em>by the endorsement on the lease, \u201c to receive and collect the balance of the said lease;\u201d and, therefore, <em>Painter </em>could have no right to demand any under the said lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">It is, however, alleged by the defendants\u2019 counsel, that although no rent was due under this lease to <em>Alexander Graham, </em>yet, there was a parol lease from <em>John Painter </em>to <em>George Barnhart, </em>and that by virtue of this, he had a right to distrain.- There is something plausible in' this. But it-is unfortunate .for the defendants, that <em>John Painter </em>should set out in Lis avowry, and in his warrant, a lease so entirely different from the one under which he claimed rent. -If such a lease, really existed, of which, I confess, I am at a loss to discover the evidence,' it cannot help -the defendants. The issue was taken upon <em>Graham\u2019s </em>lease; -which was a written lease, not a parol one. But if the defendants had eyen proved, that another lease between other parties did exist, and that the rent was due upon that other lease, and not on the lease mentioned in the avowry, the plaintiff\u2019s case would have been made out, and the defendants acknowledged to be trespassers. They can be justified only by the lease set out by themselves, or not at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">It is further urged on the part of the defendants, that <em>John Painter </em>being the administrator of <em>Lott Corson, </em>deceased, was clearly entitled to -the rent, and as administrator could distrain. This ground, I deem equally .untenable.- <em>John </em>Painter.does not claim by virtue of a lease from <em>Lott. Corson, </em>nor upon his own lease. . It must be recollected, that when <em>Graham\u2019s </em>execution was set aside, and thereupon restitution awarded, if <em>Corson </em>had been living, <em>he </em>could have claimed -restitution, and he being dead, <em>his heirs, </em>not his administrator, have the same right. ' It is unnecessary, in this case, to determine, whether an administrator can enter upon real estate, and take- the profits; it is certain, he cannot bring an ejectment for the real estate of the. intestate, nor enter upon and disturb the <em>heir, </em>without an order of sale from the Orphans\u2019 Court. See also <em>Drinkwater </em>v. <em>Drinkwater, Administrator of Prince, </em>4 <em>Mass. Rep. 356, </em>where this matter is fully elucidated. Once for all, <em>Painter </em>had not entered .upon the property and given a lease; nor does he justify, under a lease from <em>Lott Corson, </em>or himself. And I, therefore, think, the,charge of the court was erroneous, in leaving it to the jury to find for the defendants, on a supposed right in <em>John Painter, </em>as administrator of <em>Lott Corson, </em>deceased, to distrain.for the rent in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">Another error is assigned on this record. It is this, that \u201c the court erred in reinstating the appeal from the report of arbitrators, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>after the same had been stricken off;\u201d-in other words, that the whole proceedings, since the award' of arbitrators,- are illegal. I have already stated, that this was an action of replevin, in which the plaintiff complained of the illegal acts of the defendants. He does not claim any thing from <em>Lott Corson, </em>or his estate; but, demands damages from <em>John Painter </em>and <em>John C. Caul, </em>for unjustly taking and detaining his property. Clearly, trover or trespass would lie. It is evident, <em>the </em>personal acts of the defendants, constitute-th\u00ae</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">. grounds of this action; and in case of recovery, damages are recovered for the detention. The proviso in the arbitration act, allowing executors or administrators to appeal, as theretofore, cannot, and in my opinion, does not apply to cases in which executors or administrators are sued for their own acts; but'merely applies where they sue, or are sued in their representative Capacity. To construe it otherwise, would be a perversion of the act, or the provision in it. In this action, there was an award of arbitrators for the plaintiff, on the 29th of <em>July, </em>1826, against the defendants. The defendant, <em>Caul, </em>does not appeal. <em>John Painter </em>alleges, that he is administrator of <em>Lott Corson, </em>deceased, and, therefore, he can appeal without payment of costs, in an action, in which the estate Of <em>Lott Cor-son </em>is not sued, and in which damages, are demanded of him for his own personal wrong or misfeasance. To illustrate this, let me suppose <em>Painter </em>had entered a man\u2019s stable, and taken his horse, and an action of trespass or replevin, brought against him; \u2014 ,can he, by alleging, that he committed the trespass with a view to benefit some estate, of which he was administrator, claim privileges, which are <em>not </em>allowed to those who commit a trespass for their own benefit? Suppose an action of trespass had been brought against <em>Caul alone, </em>could he claim an exemption from costs, because the administrator of <em>Corson </em>had employed him, and intended:to defend him? <em>It </em>cannot be. The appeal then, by <em>Painter, </em>without payment of costs-, was illegal. The plaintiff objected immediately, and if the court\u2019 had rejected his motion, he could have taken advantage of it in this court. It is, therefore, clear on this ground, that the reinstating the appeal, (not indeed at the next term, but at the third term, after it had been stricken off,) and all subsequent proceedings were illegal, and must be reversed. It is not necessary to raise the question,, whether the court here have a right to reinstate an appeal, after it is struck off; or, whether it must be reinstated by the court of error. The plaintiff\u2019s ground is, that the appeal was illegal, and was rightly struck off, and the error, was, in the court below reinstating it. Besides, the defendant did not avow as administrator of <em>Lott Cor-son, </em>but as assignee of <em>Alexander Graham. </em>He could, therefore, not appeal, as <em>Lott Corson\u2019s </em>administrator, nor without payment of costs. The judgment is, therefore, to be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
