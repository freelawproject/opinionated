Taylor, </em>his executors; and, letters testamentary were issued to them on the <em>20th o\u00ed November, </em>1823. The executors, in pursuance of the said will, purchased; in the year 1824, of <em>John Graham </em>and wife, a tract of land, situate in <em>TVayne township, Mifflin </em>county, containing one hundred and eighteen acres; with a house, barn, and orchard thereon; for which a deed was made to the said executors,'their \"heirs, and assigns, in trust, for <em>Sample </em>Taylor, to have the rents, .issues, and profits, during life, but not subject to his debts; remainder to the heirs of his body, in fee; reversion to the heirs of <em>Matthew Taylor.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b34-7\"><em>. </em>The plaintiff in 'error, who was plaintiff below, had a judgment in the Court of Common Pleas of <em>Mifflin </em>county of <em>JLugust </em>Term, 1825, on which a <em>Fieri Facias </em>was. issued, and levied, by his directions, on the life estate of the defendant, <em>Sample Taylor, </em>in this tract of land. By virtue of a <em>Venditioni Exponas, </em>to <em>November </em>Term,. 1825, the estate thus levied-upon, was sold by -the sheriff of <em>Mifflin </em>county to the plaintiff, and a deed-for the same was'duly executed and acknowledged. The plaintiff thereupon brought an ejectment against the defendant, to recover the estate sold and conveyed to him; In this action, <em>Henry Taylor, John.Taylor, </em>.and <em>Samuel TV. Taylor, </em>executors of' <em>Matthew Taylor, </em>deceased, came into court, and prayed .to be admitted,, and were admitted, as co-defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b34-8\">. On the trial of the cause, the court charged the jury as' follows':\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AOY\"><em>Burnsid\u00e9, President. </em>\u2014 \u201cThe plaintiff\u2019s counsel contend,, that-. <em>Sample Taylor </em>had a life estate in the premises, which could- be-sold and conveyed by the sheriff, and'he let into possession to take the rents and profits of the estate during the life <em>o\u00ed Sample Taylor, </em>and insistS, 1. That a judgment is a lien' on every possible interest which a debtor has in land. 2. That a lease is subject to a judgment. 3. That a trust estate is liable for debts, and that this devise is within the statute of uses, and is subject to all the incidents of any.other estate for life.- 4. That the limitation is inconsistent with the estate granted, and that it is' subject to the debts of <em>Sample Taylor. </em>These among others embrace the arguments of the plaintiff; and, however generally correct his propositions are, this court deny their application to the case before us. <em>Matthew Taylor </em>had a right to devise his estate tr&gt; whom, and in what manner to nteasech <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>He had a right to. make a provision for his son, and such a provision-as would not be subject to the claim of creditors; and, in the opinion-of the court, by his will he has done so. The executors take the estate upon the special trust, to let <em>Sample </em>have the rents, issues, and profits for his life. They have a right to the-occupation of the estate, to rent it, to have it farmed and worked, and to pay over the rents, issues, and profits to <em>Sample </em>\u2014 they .may permit him to use it. This is not a use' executed by the statute. Trust estates have been recognised by our ovvn legislature; they are excepted out ,of the statute respecting joint tenancy. Trusts are often created for the best purposes: for the support of infants, the protection of females, and the maintenance of the unfortunate. This court deny the right of the plaintiff t'o-recover; and, they instruct you, that the sheriff\u2019s sale did not devest the executors of <em>Matthew Taylor </em>of their legal right to use and occupy this estate, and to pay over the rents, issues, and profits, .to <em>Sample </em>Taylor, and that the \u2022defendants are entitled by law to your verdict.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b35-5\">The jury accordingly found for the defendants, and the court thereupon entered judgment.

M. Hall </em>and <em>Blythe, </em>for the plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ae\">who insisted that <em>Sample Taylor </em>had such an interest in the land in dispute, as might be taken in execution, and sold for his debts: That he was to take the profits of the estate, was in the actual enjoyment of it, and could have turned the trustees out if they had refused to permit him to take the rents and profits: That the estate was clearly within the statute of uses, by which the use was executed and turned into possession; and, that it was in the power of no one to change the incidents of an estate.

There never has been a question, or doubt, as to the intention of the testator. He manifestly designed to secure to his son, <em>Sample Taylor, </em>the enjoyment of the rents, issues, and profits of the land, during his life, in such a manner, that they should not be subject to be sold for the payment of his debts; and, he constituted his. executors special trustees, to carry that intention into effect. The Court of Common Pleas correctly decided, that this was not a case within the statute of uses. It was necessary that the executors should take the legal estate for the purposes, of the trust, in order to give effect to the testator\u2019s intention; and, they were, therefore, properly held to b\u00e9 entitled to use and occupy the land, to let it, or to have it tilled and worked, so as to enable them to comply with the disposition of the testator, in regard to the applic\u00e1tion of the rents, issues, and profits to <em>Sample Taylor. </em>A different construction would make the beneficial interest, which the testator intended to provide for his son, subject to be sold for his .debts, when he -expressly declared, that it should not be so s\u00fcbject&gt; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>and would thus set up a new will in place of that which it affected to interpret. \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b37-4\">The intention of the testator ascertained, the only question is, whether his disposition is contrary to law. A man may, undoubtedly, so dispose of his land as to secure to the object of his bounty, and to him exclusively, the annual profits. The mode in which he accomplishes such a purpose, is by.creating a trust estate, explicitly '\u2022designathig the uses, and-defining .the powers of the trustees. All this, we think, has been sufficiently effected in the case under consideration. Nor is such a provision contrary to the policy of the law, or to any act of assembly. Creditors cannot complain, because they are bound to know the foundation upon which they extend their credit. The act of assembly, cited from 1 <em>Smith\u2019s Laws, </em>7,. does not apply, the land in.question not being the land of <em>Sample Taylor, </em>the defendant. He has no life estate in it, nor any interest which is subject to be sold for the payment .of his debts. The benefit he derives under the will of, his father,, is. merely the right of receiving from the trustees, th\u00e9 rents and profits of the premises, which they hold under the deed from <em>John Graham </em>and wife; to the perception \u00f3f those rents'and profits, they are in the first place entitled, for the purpose of fulfilling their trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">We.are of opinion, that thfe judgment of the Court of Common Pleas, was correct, and ought to be affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b37-6\">Top, J., dissented.</judges>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
