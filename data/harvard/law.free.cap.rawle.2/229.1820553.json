The original judgment was never transferred to <em>Perry </em>county, nor could it be by law. It was never entered in <em>Perry </em>county regularly, or otherwise. Thus, the first lien of <em>Fleming\u2019s </em>judgment on the land in question, was by the levy on the <em>Testatum Fieri Facias, </em>which was after the mortgage to the plaintiff in error. The judgment by confession on the amicable <em>Scire Facias, </em>was a mere nullity. No such former judgment existed as described in that <em>Scire Facias. </em>The subsequent proceedings of the defendant in error show, that he, himself, considered the <em>Scire Facias </em>in <em>Perry </em>county as a mere nullity. The Court of Common Pleas of <em>Perry </em>county had no jurisdiction, or power to take cognisance of a <em>Scire Facias </em>on a judgment in <em>Cumberland. </em>It is a rule of law, without exception, that a <em>Scire Facias </em>on a judgment, shall issue out of that court only in which the judgment was rendered, and in the same county. It is but a continuation of the original suit. 2 <em>Tidd. Prac. </em>983, 1007. 2 <em>Saund. </em>72. <em>Whart. Dig. 363, </em>No. 40. <em>Penn </em>v. <em>Kline, </em>1 <em>Peters\u2019s Rep. 446. </em>Consent cannot give jurisdiction. The amicable suit was of no -more avail than if it had been by adversary process. Here, if there-might be a <em>Scire Facias </em>legally brought in one distant county, there might be many others entered in other counties by the.same reason. If this can be tolerated, the confusion and injustice which must be produced by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>the practice, may be easily foreseen. The judgment by confession in <em>Perry </em>county, was not noticed. It was mere deception, for it pretended on the face of it, to be founded on a record of the court, which record could not be found, and which, in fact, never existed. As to the notice to <em>Ramsey, </em>by subscribing as a witness, the law is as clear, that he is bound by no such signature, as the fact is, that he knew nothing of the contents of the paper.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b231-6\">The counsel who was to have argued on the other side, was stopped by the court.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b231-7\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b231-8\">Tod, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A98y\">\u2014 I throw out of the case the fact of <em>Ramsey </em>having, eight months previous to his mortgage, subscribed as one of the witnesses to the confession of judgment b <em>y Fritz </em>in favour of <em>Fleming. </em>He certainly ought not to be held bound to inquire into, and remember the contents of a paper, which he was accidentally called upon to attest as a witness. <em>By </em>the way, I do not admit, that the most perfect knowledge of the judgment would have made it good against <em>Ramsey, </em>if void otherwise. As to priority of lien, we take it to' be clear, that the judgment in <em>Cumberland </em>county did not bind the land in <em>Perry. </em>The levy on the <em>Testatum Fieri Facias </em>from <em>Cumberland </em>county would have bound the land, but it was subsequent to the plaintiff\u2019s mortgage. Therefore, unless the defendant\u2019s claim is supported, by the amicable <em>Scire Facias </em>in <em>Perry </em>county, it must fail altogether. The judgment upon it was some months prior to the plaintiff\u2019s mortgage. It would appear, from the proceedings, that the amicable <em>Scire Facias </em>has been almost abandoned, and condemned by the defendant in error himself. Yet, we hold it to be the first lien, and entitled to the money. If, instead of amicable confession, that judgment of revival in <em>Perry </em>county had been by default, on adversary process by writ, perhaps it would have been absolutely void; because, the rule of the common law clearly is, that a <em>Scire Facias </em>issues out of that court only in which the record of the judgment remains; and here the record and papers, though transferred in fact, were not -legally transferred to <em>Perry </em>county. Perhaps there are some exceptions to this rule in <em>Pennsylvania, </em>by reason of inconveniences which could not exist in <em>England, </em>where the jurisdiction cf the superior courts extends throughout the kingdom, and where the creation of new counties has been unusual. But, however that may be, it seems very clear, that all the parties interested, may lawfully agree to confirm an invalid transcript, or nugatory judgment, provided the confirmation is to be efficacious, and give a lien only from the time of the agreement properly appearing. We are all of opinion, that though there was legally no such record as mentioned in the amicable <em>Scire Facias, </em>in <em>Perry </em>county, yet the defendant, <em>Fritz, </em>was estopped <em>by Ms </em>confession. He admits the validity of the record, and such admission by him, if <em>bona fide, </em>is conclusive against all claiming <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>under him by title, subsequent to the confession. Such a confession of judgment, in every amicable action, admits the issuing of a writ, though in fact, such writ never existed.
