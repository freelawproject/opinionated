Before the revolution, the than proprietaries, by warrant and survey, had appropriated, as part of their proprietary <em>tenths, </em>a tract of land, containing two thousand two hundred and twenty-two acres, on the river Delaware, including the mouth of <em>Equinunk </em>creek, and called and known by the name of the <em>Equinunk </em>manor. This land appeared to have been occupied^ and' the tillable parts of it cultivated by Preston, the defendant, or by those holding under Mm, from about the year 1796.' In orabouttheyearT801, <em>Preston </em>\u25a0alsp erected a double savv mill on the tract, which he kept employed \u2022for about ten years. He had three dwelling houses on the land, but it seems they were occupied by his tenants, not by himself. There was no, evidence by what right, or claim <em>Preston </em>held the possession, except that <em>Doyle, </em>a witness, swore, that <em>Preston </em>once claimed the land as his own property, in partnership with one <em>Drinker. </em>But in the year 1813, <em>Preston </em>purchased the whole manor, and received a conveyance from <em>John R. Coates, </em>the attorney \u2022in fact of the <em>Penns. </em>The deed begins thus:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b14-14\"><em>\u201c </em>This indenture, made the loth day of <em>March, </em>A. I). 1813, between the Honourable <em>John Penn, </em>of <em>Stoke Pogis, </em>in the county of <em>Perks, </em>in the united kingdom of <em>Great Britain </em>and <em>Ireland, </em>one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>of the late proprietaries' of <em>Pennsylvania, </em>by <em>John R. Coates, </em>of the city <em>o\u00ed Philadelphia, </em>Esq., his attorney,, duly constituted by letter of attorney, bearing date 26th of <em>March, </em>A. D. 1804, recorded <em>at Philadelphia, </em>and the Honourable <em>William Penn, </em>eldest son, and heir at law, of <em>Richard Penn, </em>Esq., deceased, who was the brother, and heir at law, of <em>John Penn, </em>deceased, the other of the said proprietaries of <em>Pennsylvania, </em>and <em>Juliana Catharina, </em>the wife of the said <em>William Penn, </em>by <em>John R. Coates, </em>their attorney, constituted by letter of attorney, bearing date the 5th of <em>March, </em>inst., intended to be forthwith recorded, of the one part, and <em>Samuel Preston, </em>of <em>Stockport, </em>in <em>Buckingham </em>township, in the county of <em>Wayne, </em>&amp;c. gentleman, of the other part \u2014 Witnesseth, that in consideration of one dollar in hand paid, and Of the further sum of two thousand seven hundred dollars, secured to be paid by bond,\u201d &amp;c. \u2022</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AGa\">The deed contained a special warranty against the <em>Penns, </em>and all claiming under them. \u2022 No part of the purchase .money appeared to have been paid. This suit was brought upon the bond for the two thousand seven hundred dollars. The def\u00e9nce upon the trial was, that the title to. the land was defective, and the muniments incomplete: that the power of attorney from <em>William Penn </em>and wife to <em>Coates, </em>never having been recorded in Wayne.county, and the words \u201c <em>intended to be forthwith </em>recorded,\u201d amounting to a covenant, this covenant had been broken by the <em>Penns </em>very much to the injury of the defendant: that the words of the deed, describing <em>William Penn </em>as eldest son, and heir at law of <em>Richard, </em>proved conclusively, that other sons must be existing with an equal fight to the estate: that the neglect to record the power of attorney \u25a0in <em>Wayne </em>county deprived <em>Preston </em>of all means of protecting the\u2019 land from intruders arid trespassers: that the timber was cut down, fences destroyed, and the- whole tract wasted and usel'\u00e9ss; and that he, <em>Preston, </em>was nonsuited, and had large costs to pay in numerous suits, brought by him against marauders- upon the property. To support this defence, <em>Preston </em>showed the -records of seven suits begun by him in the' Court of Common Pleas of <em>Wayne </em>county, most <em>o\u00ed </em>them' brought in the year 1817; one of them in trespass against <em>William </em>and <em>Joseph White, </em>in which Presi\u00f3n, the-plaintiff, was nonprossed for want of a declaration. Another suit was an ejectment against one <em>Dalton, </em>in which there was a nonpros, under a rule of court. Five of the suits were ejectments for the land, or parts of it, or trespass for cutting timber, or replevin for timber. These five suits appeared to be all against <em>William Lebar, Jacob Lebar, Daniel Lebar </em>and others. The first, and apparently the principal defendant in them all,'was <em>William-Lebar. </em>One of these five suits was pending at the time of trial. In the other four, the plaintiff, <em>Preston, </em>was nonsuited. There was proof, that the nonsuits were occasioned by want of the power of attorney, and <em>Preston\u2019s </em>inability to deduce his title. Sundry letters were read, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>dated in 1818; 1819, and 1822, showing earnest and repeated applications by <em>Preston </em>to the agent of the <em>Penns </em>for the letter of attorney, or a well authenticated transcript of it, without success. Further, it was proved by <em>Preston, </em>that since 1812, trees had been eut down on the land, much mischief done,and fences destroyed: that thirty years ago, the place was in good order, but now desolate and wasted; sapplings growing on the meadow (said one witness,) as big as his arm: that in high water, the rafts from up the creek went through the land and made roads over the fields; and, that as to timber, there was none left on the manor. <em>William Lebar, </em>a \\vitness for the plaintiffs, denied the cutting the timber, except.forty or fifty trees, for which, he said; he had permission from one of <em>Preston\u2019s </em>family. <em>William Lebar </em>also swore, and in this he was fully confirmed by one of <em>Preston\u2019s </em>own letters, that he, <em>Lebar, </em>had gone upon the land as tenant, with <em>Preston\u2019s </em>own assent. <em>Triple, </em>another tenant of <em>Preston, </em>swore, that the people landed their lumber, and placed their rafts on .the farm, without any permission from <em>Preston, </em>but that he, the witness, gave some of them permission: that some of them paid him for this permission, and all promised to pay. ;.'There was evidence, that <em>Thomas Cadwalader, </em>the present agent of the <em>Penns, </em>had offered, to the defendant a deed of confirmation of his title. \u2022 \u2018 .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b16-6\">The plaintiff\u2019s counsel requested \u25a0 the court to charge the jury as follows:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b16-7\">\u201c1.

That the letters of attorney authorize a conveyance of land in the city and county of <em>Philadelphia, </em>as well as in every other county in the state, and were legally recorded in the city and county of <em>Philadelphia; </em>and that an exemplification of the powers of attorney from the records of that county, is evidence in any county in the state.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b16-9\"><em>\u201c </em>3d. That the deed of confirmation, offered by <em>T.

That the Court erred in charging the jury, that the deed from the plaintiffs to the defendant, contained a covenant, that the power of attorney from <em>William Penn, </em>should be recorded within a reasonable time, and that the said-covenant, if any, was not complied with by recording it in the county of <em>Philadelphia.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b17-10\"><em>2. </em>That the Court erred in their answer to the <em>fourth </em>point, particularly in saying, that the defendant could not recover, without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>evidence of title, for trespasses committed on the tract of land not included within his enclosures and improvements, even against a trespasser, without colour of title.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b18-6\">3.

That the-charge was incorrect and uncertain in this, that the-Court did not leave it to the jury to determine to what amount, if any,, the consideration had failed; but assumed, that if the jury believed certain facts, then the failure of consideration, and the defendant\u2019s loss and damage were so gre\u00e1t as to amount to a defence to the' plaintiffs* whole demand, and entitle the defendant to a verdict.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b18-9\"><em>Conyngham </em>and Mallary, argued for the plaintiffs in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b18-10\">They cited the following authorities: \u2014 1 <em>Selw. </em>N. <em>P. </em>463, 465. <em>Leazure </em>v. <em>Hillegas, </em>7 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>313. 3 <em>Stark.

But was the recording in the office at <em>Philadelphia </em>sufficient? I think not, unless there was in the city or county of <em>Philadelphia, </em>real estate of the grantors to be affected by the power. <em>Leazure </em>v. <em>Hillegas, </em>7 <em>Serg. </em>&amp; <em>Rawle, 313, </em>and <em>M'Keen </em>v. <em>Delancy, 5 Cra. 22, </em>shpw, that a copy of a deed is evidence, when taken from the recorder\u2019s office of the county in which only a part of the land lies that is comprehended in the deed. . But there was-not shown to be any real estate in <em>Philadelphia </em>subject to the power;, and, the existence of such estate, was not a fact of which there could be any sufficient legal notoriety, without some proof. The court below was clearly right throughout this first head.</p>\n<p id=\"b18-14\">2. But I think that the second allegation of er-ror is sustained, and that <em>Preston, </em>for all the trespasses committed on his land, might well recover without producing any paper title whatsoever. He had been for twenty-five years in full possession. But all this length <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>\u2022of time was not wanted. Possession itself, is a title against a wrongdoer. I refer to the cases cited in the argument. See also 6 <em>Com. Dig. Trespass, B. 2. </em>Intruder on. the king\u2019s possession may have trespass. In <em>Weidman </em>v. <em>Kohr, 13 Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>22, Duncan, J., lays down the short conclusion of the law on this subject, \u201cThat where a plaintiff is in actual possession, the defendant cannot give a title in a third person in evidence. He may justify, by command of the owner, but such command is traversable.\u201d In this case, beyond a question, the possession was such as to comprehend the timber, though not enclosed. I hold, that there is no usage of the country, nor rule of the common law, nor any reason requiring a man to enclose his timber land; and, that for any possible purpose that can be named, the woods belonging to a farm are as well protected by the law without a fencers with one. No doubt, there must be frequent cases, in which the production of title is necessary to show the extent of possession. -But here there seems no pretence from the evidence, to say, that the boundaries of the <em>Equinunk </em>manor were unknown or doubtful. Besides, <em>William Lebar, </em>the \u25a0principal defendant in the five suits, had been placed'on the land by <em>Preston </em>himself, after he had purchased from the <em>Penns. ' </em>Clearly then, as to <em>Lebar, </em>np title could be wanted to support ejectment by a landlord against his tenant. But whether the landlord could remover in trespass, while <em>Lebar </em>was in the actual legal possession, is \u25a0another matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b19-5\">S. The defect in <em>Preston\u2019s title, </em>arising from the description in the deed of <em>William Penn, </em>as eldest son, and heir at law. I think this assignment of error is also sustained. Certainly the terms, eldest son, and heir at law, might imply that he was not the only child. Some explanation of the meaning could, perhaps, easily have been given' -in the recitad;-for I believe, that during forty years past and more, the general practice has been, in proprietary, deeds, to describe one or another of the grantors in the same language, as <em>eldest son, and heir at law. </em>We have all witnessed numerous objections to the form and substance of deeds. This objection is, perhaps, made for the first time in the present case. It is not even alleged, that there \u2022is any real difficulty of title. <em>Preston </em>has-been in possession twenty-five or thirty-years, and has never .heard of any claimant in opposition to <em>William </em>or <em>Richard Penn. </em>It would appear exceedingly hard to permit him to withhold the purchase money on account of a supposed flaw in the wording of a deed which he accepted and held for a long time without any objection. '</p>\n<p id=\"b19-6\">As to <em>the fourth </em>assignment of error, it is not easy to discover any just and legal principle, upon which the damages sustained \u2022could be made to amount to the sum total of the purchase money of the land, even supposing all the points of defence to have been made out. A small expense; and any. reasonable- diligence, would have enabled <em>Preston </em>to -obtain the original letter of attorney, of an authenticated copy, with evidence to sustain it, or proof of the- con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>tents, if the instrument itself had been lost. And of the timber left on the tract by <em>Preston\u2019s </em>saw mill, suppose one hundred, or two hundred, or even five hundred trees had been gleaned by <em>Lebar </em>and others, in the capacity of trespassers instead of tenants, and that no redress could be had by law for these outrages, solely for want .of recording the power of attorney, yet, it would seem most unreasonable, that the whole manor should-go to the.defendant and his heirs for ever, to indemnify against a temporary loss of some of the products. Probably, the tenants have paid more attention to their own interest than- to the interest of their landlord. Mr. <em>Preston </em>knew when he purchased, as well, as he does now, that land at the outlet of the Equinunk',, must, continue subject to the little annoyances of rafts and raftsmen; and, that the fences must suffer by .high water, or otherwise. He ought also to have known,, and probably did know, that' law suits neglected, will produce costs and vexation about as readily as. a meadow neglected will produce saplings; and, that there must be many losses which the vendor of land can never be justly made to pay for.</p>\n<p id=\"b20-6\">Judgment reversed, and a <em>venire facias de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
