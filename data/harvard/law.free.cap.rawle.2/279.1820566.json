The plaintiffs also gave in evidence a mortgage,, bearing the same date as the bond, and given to secure its payment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b279-11\">The defendant called, as a witness, <em>Andrew Busch, </em>who having-been sworn on his <em>voir dire, </em>at the request of the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel, declared as <em>follows: </em>\u2014 \u201c I hold a bond and. mortgage of <em>Lewis Enters, </em>on the same property, which is covered by the mortgage of the plaintiffs\u2019 testator. Mine is the younger and unsatisfied. It is for two thousand four hundred dollars. There are three hundred dollars interest on it. I think the property mortgaged worth between five and six thousand dollars.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b279-12\">The plaintiffs\u2019 counsel objected to the admission of the witness, and the court sustained the objection.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AFf\">The rejection of the .witness was now assigned for error by <em>S. Levy, </em>who contended, that the witness had no fixed interest in the result of the suit. His evidence did not go to enlarge or create a fund, out of which he was to be paid, except in the event of contingencies, which the court would not regard. He cited, 1 <em>Phill.

The action is, however, on the bond, and although the mortgaged premises <em>may possibly </em>be levied under the judgment, that is by no means a necessary consequence, the personal estate of the defendant being equally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>liable; so that the interest of the witness depending on the contingency of the fund for payment of his debt, being taken away by a superior lien, affected his credibility, but not his competency.</p>\n<p id=\"AK9\">Judgment reversed, and a <em>venire facias de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
