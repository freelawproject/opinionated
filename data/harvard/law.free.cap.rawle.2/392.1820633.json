I told him there was. nothing to be had from <em>Sailor, </em>and if we sued, we had to sue both. They paid on the interest till about two years before we sued. We did not receive any interest after my father\u2019s death. Just before the sale, <em>Peter Shviely </em>came and asked if I would sell the bond to him or not. I told him we had employed Mr. <em>Porter, </em>and I must ask him. Mr. <em>Porter </em>said I should not sell it: that they wanted to injure the widow. <em>Shively </em>said he would pay it almost any time, if I would let him have the bond.

Mr. <em>Porter </em>said that if I assigned the bond, it would turn the old. lady out of house and home, and that I should not assign the bond.

His execution of the power in the will of <em>Peter Lantz, </em>under which his pretended 'title is derived,'is totally defective, and vested no interest in him. Powers must be strictly pursued in their execution, particularly where the sale is for the pay-A ment of legacies. ,Tha want of signing, sealing, attestation, enrolling the prescribed number of witnesses, where these things are required by the instrument creating the power, will avoid the execution of it. <em>Willes, </em>10.9. 2 <em>Preston Abs. of Titles, </em>249, 262, 267, 273, 279. Here the power was to sell in a mode indicated by the testator, for cash or security/.- <em>Isaac, </em>the brother of <em>Jacob, </em>nominally, became the purchaser, for.the benefit of <em>Jacob, </em>the executor and trustee. No money was paid; no mortgage or security of any kind-given; and, consequently, all that was pretended to have, been done in execution of the power was void. The sale was not only in contradiction to the directions of the will, but of the conditions of sale of the executors.themselves, according to which, one-third of the purchase '\u00bfmoney iyap to be paid on the 1st of <em>Jipril </em>following, and the resi.due in three equal annual payments, secured by bond and mortgage, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>or such other security as the executors might demand. It is true, to a certain extent, that the character of the security was left to the discretion of the executors, but they exercised no discretion, took no security; and security of some kind was indispensable to a valid execution of the power. The bond taken was cancelled, without any equivalent, which was inequitable and fraudulent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"135\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b413-6\">A still greater objection to the sale exists. The executor purchased undercover, for his own benefit; and, therefore, cannot.hold the property, for equity never permits a trustee to become a purchaser of the trust estate, without the consent of the <em>cestui que trust. </em>-It is the contrariety of interest.between the buyer and'seller which produces a fair price, which cannot .be-attained when the same person is both buyer and seller.- Such a deed as that under which <em>Jacob Lantz </em>purchased, like a voluntary deed, is good against the parties to it, but void against every body else. There is no case to show, that a trustee may purchase from himself, even if he does not make advantage by the purchase. The receipts given in evidence; were for payments subsequent to the sale under which the plaintiff claims, and with which the defendant had no concern. They did not amount to a ratification of the execution of the power, for a man'can ratify only for himself, and not for others. The effect of treating them as a .ratification,-will be to prejudice creditors by a family arrangement, which can never be permitted. The defendant certainly never ratified the sale, and the act of no one else could bind him:-. That he did so actually, is-not pretended, and there is nothing' to show, that he did so constructively. Even if-the original sal\u00e9 had been to <em>Isaac </em>for -his own benefit, yet when <em>Jacob </em>afterwards purchased of him, he took the estate subject to all 'the trusts which attached to it in the hands of the executors, as if there had been no sale. <em>Boon </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>1 <em>Vern. </em>60, 61. <em>2 Preston Abs. </em>231. 2 <em>Madd.

If it did not, the land remains charged, for a sale under a power to pay legacies, does not put the estate beyond the reach of creditors. <em>Hannum </em>v. <em>Spear, </em>2 <em>Dall. </em>291. <em>S.

This he' did before the sale, and He cannot, by making'a sale to himself, alter his situation. He remains a trustee just as if there had been no sale.

On the 19th of <em>February, </em>1816, the will of <em>Peter Lantz, </em>which contained a power to sell, was proved. On the 8th of <em>June, </em>1816, a sale was made, by the executors to <em>Isaac Lantz, </em>and,on the-16th of <em>November, </em>1816, a deed for the premises was executed by the executors to'the purchaser. The security may, at first, have rested on the personal- responsibility of <em>Isaac, </em>but be afterwards actually gave bond with security, which was cancelled when he recofiveyed. The purchase money was payable partly down, and partly by instalments. . On the 19th of <em>March, </em>1S17, <em>Isaac </em>conveyed a -moiety to <em>Jacob </em>for one-half of the. original consideration-;. on the next day, they both conveyed a portion of the land to <em>George Lantz, </em>in satisfaction of his share. On the \"2d of <em>April, </em>1822, <em>Isaac </em>conveyed to <em>Jacob </em>the residue, for the consideration of three thousand five hundred dollars. Thus <em>Jacob, </em>if the sale was not a nullity, became the owner of the whole on the 2d of <em>April, </em>1822. On'the first of April,.1818,1819, and 1820, respectively,- portions of the purchase money became due. In <em>April, </em>1818, <em>Jacob Lantz </em>p\u00e1id to the,children of the testator, except <em>John, </em>the proportions,then due to them under this sale. On the 16th of <em>April, </em>1818, the widow deceived five, hundred and twenty-seven dollars and thirty-two cents. The legatees received what was due to them- in 1819 and 1820. Thus the sale was ratified by the legatees. It was after this ratification that <em>Isaac </em>conveyed to <em>Jacob. </em>Eight ye\u00e1rs elapsed after the death of the testator before <em>Best </em>brought any suit on his bond. The bond was a joint and several bond, given by <em>Peter Lantz </em>and <em>Peter Sailor </em>to <em>John Lantz, </em>who assigned it to <em>John Best. </em>The creditors of <em>Jacob Lantz </em>desired <em>Best\u2019s </em>executors to transfer the-bond to them, which was refused. Having-shown, that'there was no equity in the. legatees, or the creditors of <em>Peter Lantz, </em>we approach the points involved in the case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"140\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b414-8\">1. Had the. plaintiff a right to have execution of the lands in question, as 'the estate of <em>Jacob Lantz? </em>If, at the time .the judgment was obtained, he had any estate, discharged from the lien of the debts of the deceased, the plaintiff had a right to take it in execution. If,.-on- the other hand, the estate continued to be that of <em>Peter Lantz, </em>he had ho such right. \u00c1 sale under' the will, had the effect of discharging the land from the lien of the testator\u2019s debts, and substituting the. proceeds of sale as a fund for their payment. It was not the case of a power to sell for legacies,-but a general- order to sell for the purposes of the will, to pay both debts and legacies; and in this respect, it differs from <em>Hannum </em>v. <em>Spear. </em>That such was the intention of the testator,, is de'ducible from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>whole tenor of the will, in which, nothing is said about payment of debts out of the personality, and there is no evidence of its sufficiency for that purpose. In England, the provisions of this will would subject the land to the payment of simple contract debts. If the power was to sell both for debts and legacies, the purchaser held it discharged, and was not bound to look to the application of the purchase money. <em>Grant </em>v. <em>Hook, </em>13 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>263. <em>Ram. bler </em>v. <em>Osgood, </em>1 <em>Johns.

As to the execution of the power, it is conceded, that if it was a nullity, it produced no fruit. Taking it for granted, however, that <em>Jacob </em>was interested in the purchase, there is no authority to show, that the sale was therefore void. It certainly was not void at law. The trustee purchaser can be held to his bargain, and if relief be sought against him, it is,, in equity,- to declare him a trustee. But before the sale can- be rescinded, what .the purchaser has paid should be tendered to him. The principle by which such cases are governed is, not that the trustee shall not buy, but that he shall not buy to make advantage. Here a very high price was given for the estate. 3 <em>Ves. </em>740. <em>Madd. Ch. </em>110, 112, 114. <em>Lazarus </em>v. <em>Bryson, </em>3 <em>Binn. </em>54, 62. At law, <em>Isaac Lantz </em>was a purchaser under a power in the will; and <em>Jacob </em>was at law a purchaser from <em>Isaac.</em>The only persons who had a right tp object, were the legatees of the testator, and they have all ratified the proceeding. Suppose the' power had been to sell for the purpose of making a division, and-the estate had been put up by the executors, with the consent' of the' legatees, and purchased by the executors, can it be doubted the sale would be good? And subsequent confirmation is equivalent to original consent. The party objecting is the creditor of the testator,-, and he has no right to do so. His lien on the land was discharged-by the operation of 1'he act of assembly of the 4th of <em>Jlpril, </em>1797, <em>Purd. Big. </em>533, which limits the lien of the debts of a decedent to seven years. Eight years had elapsed after the death of <em>Peter Lantz, </em>before the plaintiff commenced his suit. -It cannot be pretended, that an executor or'trustee can in no case be a purchaser.</p>\n<p data-order=\"142\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b415-7\">It is objected, that no security was given, and- that the want of it vitiated the sale. By the will, the executors were to take \u201csecurity to their satisfaction;-\u201d and a similar stipulation was made in the conditions of sale. Such security they took in the bond of <em>Isaac </em>with surety.-- Upon the whole, the sale was valid. It might have been-questioned, but stands good for want of having been questioned-by those who had a right to do so.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"143\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b415-8\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b415-9\">Rogers, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AJ\">\u2014 At a very early day, the legislature departed so far from the <em>English </em>system of jurisprudence, as-to-make all debts of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>what character soever, chargeable on the real and personal estate of .the debtor. Under the act of assembly of 1705, the real estate of debtors has been' held liable to sale by execution, whether they be living or,dead; .if living, under a judgment and execution against themselves; if dead, under a judgment and execution against their heirs, executors, or administrators. -Debts, whether by simple-contract or otherwise, wefe decided to be a lien on the real estate o'f the deceased, in the hands.of an alienee,- as in <em>Graff </em>v. <em>Smith\u2019s Administrators, 1 </em>Dall. <em>48</em>2, where it was ruled, that lands of a deceased person .were bound for the payment of his debts, and might' be taken iri execution, although the'heir or devisee, may have sold them <em>\\.o abona fide </em>purchaser. As this.produced inconvenience, the legislature passed the fourth-section of'the act of 1797, in which they recite the mischief intended, to be remedied, with a reference, as I conceive, to the decision of' the court in the case to which I have referred.. . ' \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">\u201cWhereas inconveniences may arise from the debts of deceased persons r\u00e9maining a lien on their lands and tenements, an indefinite period of time after their decease, whereby <em>bona fide purchasers </em>may be injuredj.and' titles become insecure, therefore, be' it enacted, \u201cThat no such debts, except they be secured by mortgage, judgment, or recognisance, or other- record, shall remain a lien on the said lands-and tenements, longer than\u2019seven'years after th.e decease of such debtor, unless, an action for the rebo-Very thereof be commenced, and duly prosecuted' against\u2019his or her he'irs, executors, or administrators', wjthin the said period of seven- years;-or a copy, or particular-written statement.\u2019of any bond, covenant,\u2019debt, or demand, when the same is not payable within the said period of seven years, shall be filed within the said period in,the office of. the prothonotary of the county where the lands li\u00e9.\u201d ...</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">Independently of this act, the title of the terretenant would clearly be good, because the real estate must b\u2019e first applied to the payment of the debts of the deceased, rendered. liable by-prior enactments, tobe taken in execution' and sold, .without limitation in point of time, even in the hands of \u00e1 <em>bona fide </em>purchaser. The debts would be a continuing-and subsisting lien up to the timeof the sale, to the terretenant.' it becomes, then, necessary to inquire, whether such proceedings have been -had, as to divest the right of the creditors of <em>Peter Lantz </em>to look to the real fund for payment of debts. The title of <em>Jacob Lantz </em>depends upon a. sale by the executors, in pursuance of a power in. the will of the deceased; and I will assume, that the will authorised the executors to sell; and that so .far as repects <em>theindiciuin </em>of execution, the power has been regularly pursued, and tha.t the sale has been ratified by the devisees and heirs. It appears in e.vidence, that <em>Jacob Lantz, one </em>of the executors, was a joint purchaser, and that he afterwards became, and at the rendition of the judgment against the executors of <em>Peter Lantz, </em>was the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>sole owner of the estate. Is he, then, such a purchaser as is contemplated by the fourth section of the act of assembly of 1797? Although in <em>The Lessee of Lazarus </em>v. Bryson, 3 <em>Binn. </em>58, the late Chief Justice says, that a purchase by a sheriff, where he is buyer and seller, is <em>void; </em>yet, I agree with the counsel, that the title of the executor was not void, but <em>voidable. </em>The power in the will constitutes the executors trustees for the devisees and heirs; the general law, with the devise, trustees for the benefit of the creditors. The creditors have an interest in the fund, paramount to the title of the devisees and heirs, and independent of the will of the testator. Where, then, the executor, or a'trustee, becomes the purchaser, he takes it clothed with the same trusts as it was liable to in his hands previous to the sale. The law will not endure, that a sham sale, or one against public policy, shall create a right in prejudice of creditors, who have liens upon the land; nor should their rights be impaired without an express assent on their part. The creditors should still, notwithstanding a pretended sale or transfer, which may be a mere cover to fraud, be at liberty to pursue their remedy against the executors, and upon judgment and execution to sell the land, as they would have an unquestionable right to do, if it were in the possession of the heirs or devisees; nor does this contravene the principle of <em>Grant </em>v. <em>Hook, </em>13 <em>Serg. </em>&amp; <em>Rawle, </em>259, that where the testator authorised his.executors to sell as much of his real estate as should be necessary to pay his debts and educate his minor children, the executors had power to sell the real estate of the testator free from the incumbrance of his debts, and the purchaser was not bound to see to the application of the purchase money. And this is doubtless the law, taken with the qualification, that the purchaser is not both buyer and seller; for it would be highly unreasonable, that the purchaser, who is a stranger, shall be answerable for the misconduct of the executor, arising from a misapplication of the purchase money. He is not expected to see to the observance of a trust, unlimited and undefined. But where the executor becomes the purchaser, the reason does not exist, and I cannot perceive the justice in his favour, or for the benefit of his creditors, of divesting the lien against thehreal estate, and turning it into a personal right against the fraudulent trustee. , I say fraudulent trustee, for the law so regards him as having acted in contravention of public policy. It would be unwise to throw such a temptation in the way of executors and heirs, who by combination and fraud, may affect the rights of creditors. Such a consequence of the power to sell does not accord with the spirit of our laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">Great reliance is placed on the fact, that at the commencement of the suit against the estate, more than seven years had elapsed from the death of <em>Peter Lantz. </em>It must be remembered, that the act of 1797, does not create, but limits the lien. Accordingly, it has always been held, that the lien does not cease to exist, except <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>as against <em>bona fide </em>purchasers, for the generality of the enacting' clause is restrained by the preamble. The lien of the creditors still continues, unless divested by a sale to a person, who stands in that situation.' The argument is, that the sale is voidable; and I agree that it is,- and that the devisees or heirs, have validated the sale by the acceptance of their respective shares of the purchase money. As against those who hav.e received th.eir nibney in whole or in part, with a full knowledge of the transaction, the sale would operate as a legal transfer, by force of the subsequent .assent; for it would be against equity for them, under such circumstances, to -dispute' its validity. But although it is clear, that they can affirm the sale, yet, -it-is equally plain, that each can affirm the sale only for himself. And if this is the case, as respects the heirs or devisees, whose titles are co-ordinate, how'much more forcibly does the principle apply to creditors who claim paramount to the devisees, and whose lien covers the whole fund. -The creditors of <em>Peter Lantz </em>have done no act which can be tortured into an affirmance of the voidable title of the executor. So. far from assenting to the sale, they elect to proceed against the fund; primarily liable for their debt. <em>Jacob Lantz </em>had it in his power to. vest a complete title'in himself, by payment of the-creditors. But this he has neither done, nor offered to do. As there has been, then, no such absolute transfer of the title, as the law recognises, the creditors have a right, and this they have done,'to consider the'land in the same situation it was when <em>Peter Lantz </em>died; and if so, their lien continues unaffected by lapse of time. The purchase by a trustee, of the interest of the <em>cestui que trust, </em>has always been viewed with great jealousy. They are not allowed to purchase the trust property, because, from their situation, and the knowledge it enables'them, to acquire, they may be induced to -commit a fraud upon their <em>cestui que trust. </em>It is not necessary to show, that the trustee has made an advantageous purchase, or that there was fraud. The\u2019law has prohibited-it altogether, to prevent -the temptation to which the interest of the <em>cestui que trust </em>would necessarily be exposed. The rule has been wisely adopted to prevent fraud; and as I-arn opposed to any relaxation, 1 am of opinion, in which I have the concurrence \u00f3f a majority of.the court,' that the judgment b.e reversed, and a new trial awarded.</p>\n<author id=\"b418-5\">Gibson, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AxC\">\u2014 It seems to me, the verdict ought not to be disturbed. Whether <em>Best\u2019s </em>lien, under which the defendant purchased, were originally divested by a valid execution of the-power or not, it is certain, that when he instituted his action, it had expired by efflux of time, and was extinct to every intent and purpose. I take this species of lien to be analogous to that of a judgment, which ceases at,the end of the prescribed period, without regard to considerations derived from the absence of actual notice, as was held in <em>The Bank of North America </em>v. Fitzsimons, 3 <em>Binn. </em>342. Tp remove all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>uncertainty on this head, the legislature has declared record notice to be indispensable; and after a declaration so explicit, it seems to me, we can substitute nothing else. The laws have heretofore fostered the freedom of alienation, which habits of enterprise, unparalleled in any other people, have rendered essential to the well-being of society. Even the lien of a judgment, although it be matter of record, is not tolerated beyond a period of shorter duration than is assigned to this unregistered lien\u2019 of a decedent\u2019s debt. It would, therefore, be against the spirit of legislation, evinced in parallel cases, to extend it by implication. The plain intent was to allow the creditor a period, in the first place, sufficient in all reason, for the assertion of his claim; and after that, to hold him strictly to re~ .cord notice. At the institution of <em>Best\u2019s </em>action, the lien of his debt was gone. Nor was it prolonged by the provisions of the will. As regards legacies, blending the real with the personal estate, so as to constitute one entire fund, subjects the land to the burdens of the personal assets. But such a blending, uncoupled with an express direction, is insufficient to charge the land with the debts. In <em>jEngland, </em>frequent ineffectual attempts have been made to induce the parliament to declare simple contract debts to be a charge by law. But'the evil resulting from the want of such a provision, has been much lessened by the frequency of testamentary provisions for payment of debts; and these are consequently interpreted as liberally as the words will bear. Yet it was long doubted, and is perhaps not yet settled, whether a general 'direction to pay in the first instance, renders the debt a charge. With us, every species of debt is charged for a limited time by act of the legislature; still the <em>English </em>cases are authority to show, that the blendiirg of the two funds is not sufficient, <em>per s\u00e9, </em>to place the creditors on higher ground than is assigned to them by the laws. In the will before us, the whole estate is thrown into a common fund, for purposes of distribution among the children; not one word being said about the creditors, who are, therefore, left to their legal rights. Then the lien .of <em>Best\u2019s </em>debt having been gone at the institution of his action, it remains to inquire, whether the execution of the power can be questioned by a purchaser under the judgment, and whether the. reconveyance to <em>Jacob Lantz, </em>together with the extinguishment of the claims of the other children, does not constitute him a purchaser of at least an undivided interest in the estate. If the affirmative be made out, it will follow, that nothing but his own share was subject, as the estate of the decedent, to <em>Best\u2019s </em>execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">It must be admitted, that the power was defectively executed in equity, and perhaps, even at law. <em>Jacob Lantz </em>was a secret purchaser at his own sale, and on the reconveyance of the ostensible .purchaser, chancery would undoubtedly have declared him a trustee for those beneficially entitled under the will. But nothing is clearer, than that they might ratify in equity an execution of the power good <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>at law; and for this purpose, nothing was necessary but an act <em>in pais, </em>that should satisfactorily indicate their assent. So', if the power were executed defectively at law, or not at all, they were competent to waive the execution of it altogether, and take the land itself, instead of the price. The doctrine on this point is stated in <em>Craig </em>v. <em>Leslie, 3 Wheat. </em>563. It seems to me, that by extinguishing the claims of his brothers and sisters, <em>Jacob Lantz </em>became the equitable owner of the whole estate, and that choosing to dispense with the execution of the power, as useless, the estate is in him by operation of law. I lay out of the case all consideration of his having been an executor. Different rights in an individual, are to be treated, <em>reddendo singula singulis, </em>as if they existed separately in different persons. <em>Had he. been a trustee of the land </em>eor the creditors, they might perhaps have been entitled to the benefit of his purchase; but I think, it is clear, they had not a particular interest under the will. As a tenant in common with his brothers and sisters, I know of no rule of law to prevent him from purchasing their estates. Take it, that the transaction is to be scanned more narrowly than if it were with a stranger; still, if it were <em>bona fide, </em>and not to elude the debts, it is not easy to see why it shall be deemed fraudulent for reasons of policy. If it were fraudulent in fact, that might be shown; but actual fraud is not pretended, and if \u00e1 tenant in common may, in any case, be a purchaser of the estates of his co-tenants, <em>Jacob Lantz </em>is such. To the validity'of his title, they have precluded themselves from objecting, and they do not object. .What right, then, hadNesi, who had no interest in the land, equitable or legal, to object; or have execution of it in the hands of one who had paid for it? I admit, that the share <em>o\u00ed-Jacob Lantz, </em>himself, for which he paid nothing, passed by the levy and sale to the defendant; but, it seems to me, the shares of the other children are bound by the plaintiffs judgment, and liable to execution; the <em>quantum </em>of their interest to be determined in an action of partition between the defendant and the purchaser.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">Tod, J. having been unwell during the argument, took no part in the decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">Judgment reversed, and a new trial awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
