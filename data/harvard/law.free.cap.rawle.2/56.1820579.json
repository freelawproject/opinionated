In this case, the money raised by the sale went to a judgment creditor; against whom, this mortgage, not recorded until after his judgment was obtained, was a nullity.. <em>Semple </em>v. <em>Burd, 7 Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>286. In <em>Pennsylvania, </em>land can never be subject to more than one judicial sale, upon incumbrances of any kind, existing at the time of such sale; and hence, though a creditor. may have several securities, such as a bond, and a mortgage, and judgments on them, he cannot sell <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>the land twice. <em>9 Serg. Rawle, </em>304. \u201cBy the uniform practice of this state, both before and since the Revolution, no difference is effected by sales being had' under early or late mortgages or judgments. A <em>Venditioni Exponas, </em>under a late judgment, has always been' considered a sufficient authority to the sheriff to sell lands discharged from former incumbrances, even though intermediate judgments could not be paid off on the ac.tual sale.\u201d <em>Per Lewis, arguendo, 2 Yeates, </em>45. <em>Per </em>Tilgiiman, C. L 3 <em>Binn. </em>358. Whatever may- be the doctrine in <em>England, </em>here, the mortgagor, as regards third persons, and even as regards the mortgagee, is deemed the owner of the land: he is seized of the <em>legal estate, </em>and the mortgage is but an incumbrance. The extent to which the principle has been carried by our courts, may be collected from <em>The President, &amp;c. of the Schuylkill Navigation Company </em>v. <em>Thoburn, </em>7 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>411. \u2018It is <em>true, </em>that the mortgagee may maintain' ejectment; and, in consequence of the defective organization of our courts, his administrator, or the assignee of his administrator, may do so; but that' is between the parties themselves. <em>Simpson\u2019s Lessee </em>v. <em>Ammons, 1 Binn. </em>175. Here, the question is between third persons, one of whom is a <em>bona fide </em>purchaser under a judicial sale, not bound-to look to the application of the purchase money. The case of <em>Febiger\u2019s Lessee </em>v. <em>Craighead, </em>a short and imperfect note of which is to be found in 4 <em>Dall. Rep. </em>151, but which is fully reported, <em>2 Yeates, </em>42, was the case of a mortgage to the Trustees of the Loan Office, under the act of assembly, of <em>February, </em>26th, 1773, <em>(Prov. Laws, </em>478, <em>sect. </em>16,) the provisions of which secured a priority, and preserved the lien, \u2022 notwithstanding the sale under a subsequent judgment. So by <em>consent </em>of the purchaser \u2022 the lien may remain. <em>Stackpole </em>v. <em>Glassford, </em>16 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>163. But, if it be conceded, that a mortgage is but an incumbrance on land as against third- persons, then the question in this case is settled by <em>Nichols </em>v. <em>Postlethwaite, 2 Dall. </em>131, and <em>Barnet </em>v. <em>Washebaugh, </em>16 <em>Serg. Rawle, </em>410, in which cases it was decided, that, where a legacy is charged upon land, the sheriff\u2019s vendee under a judgment obtained against the devisee of the land, takes the land discharged of the lien of the legacy, and - the legatee must look to the proceeds of sale, in the sheriff\u2019s hands. The reasoning of the court in this case is conclusive.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b60-6\">As to the other point, a <em>Scire Facias </em>is not in general amendable; and it is. never so where advantage has been taken of an error in it, by pleading <em>mil tiel record. 2 Tidd, (Farr. Edit.) </em>1036, 1037, <em>note, (d</em>.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b60-7\"><em>Williston </em>and <em>Mallory, </em>for the defendant in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AK\">were desired by the court to speak only to the question, whether the mortgage was discharged by the sale. They argued, that a mortgage creates a specific lien upon land, indefinite in its duration, and is so far from being a mere incumbrance, that in a court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>law it has never been considered as any thing but a conveyance. of the land itself. The mortgagor has parted with his legal title as between himself and the mortgagee; and it is contrary to good faith, as well as a legal anomaly, to permit him who has ere-, ated a specific lien, and parted with his legal estate in order to do so, indirecitly to procure a sale of the land, and defeat his creditor, by the subsequent creation of a mere incumbrance. All confidence in mortgages, as securities, will be destroyed, by such a decision; and it is well known, that immense sums have been loaned in the city of <em>Philadelphia, </em>where these mortgagees lived, and elsewhere, upon the faith of the opinion, that they remained liens upon land sold under subsequent judgments. It is tru.e, that, because money has been raised by a pledge, the owner of-the land, or chattel pledged, does not, therefore, cease to have power, to borrow more, or create other liens upon it; but-the only mode .by which the subsequent creditor can secure himself is, to pay off the prior lien; and hence, in <em>England, </em>where there are several mortgages, on the same estate, one behind another, the order in which the mortgagees will be let in to redeem is, that the second do redeem the first, the third the second, and so on.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>' \u201cThe principle is believed to be universal,\u201d says Marshall, C. J. <em>(Rankin </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>12 <em>Wheat. </em>179.) \u201c that a prior lien gives a prior claim, which is entitled to'prior' satisfaction, out of the subject it binds, unless the lien be intrinsically defective, of be displaced, by some act of the party holding it, which shall postpone him in a court of law or equity, to a subsequent claimant.. Take the common case of mortgages. It has never been supposed, that a subsequent mortgagee could, by obtaining and executing a decree for the sale of the mortgaged premises; obtain precedence over a prior mortgage, in which all the requisites of the law had been observed. If such decree should be made, without preserving the rights of the prior mortgagee, the property would remain subject to those rights in the hands of t\u00edre purchaser.\u201d Chief Justice Tilghman, in <em>Moliere\u2019s Lessee </em>v. <em>Noe, </em>4 <em>Dall. </em>450, was of opinion, and Judges Yeaiies and Brackenridge, concurred with him, that, under a sale by order of the Orphan\u2019s Court, for the payment of debts, though the purchaser took the land discharged from the lien <em>o\u00ed judgments, </em>yet,, that a <em>mortgage </em>\u201cstood upon a different footing from judgments, because the mortgagee is, strictly speaking, the owner of the land, and may recover it in ejectment; the mortgagor has no more than an equity of redemption; and the Orphans\u2019 Court has not power to sell a greater estate than he is possessed of.\u201d And the ground upon which he refused to interfere, to assist the mortgagee to take the amount of his mortgage, out of the money in court, in <em>Patterson </em>v. <em>Sample, </em>4 <em>Yeates, </em>308, where lands subject to a prior mortgage had been sold under a subsequent judgment, was, because \u201c the mortgagee had a plain and simple remedy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>on the mortgage.\u201d In this opinion, Judge Brackenridge united with him; and Judge Smith openly stated his opinion to be, \u201cthat no sale under a later judgment, can affect prior judgments, unless they are fully paid by the sale.\u201d Judge Brackenridge never gave up his opinion; which, he says, was that of Chief Justice Shipten, and has left his protest against the doctrine now contended for. <em>Law </em>Miscellanies, 258. Judge Yeates, it is true, did not go so far (2 <em>Binn. </em>218, 4 <em>Yeates, </em>316,) as the other judges. <em>Febiger\u2019s Lessee </em>v. <em>Craighead, </em>2 <em>Yeates, </em>42, 4 <em>Dall. </em>151; i\u00e1 a direct authority, that a mortgage does remain a lien on land sold under a subsequent judgment-; for the provisions of the act of assembly, of <em>February </em>26, 1773, gave -no greater estate to the'trustee of the Loan Office, than passes to every mortgagee; to wit, the fee simple, subject to a 'condition. Mr. <em>Dallas\u2019s </em>report of it shows how the decision Was understood when it was made.- The uniform practice stated by Mr. <em>Lewis </em>in Judge Yeates\u2019s report of that case'was de-. nied by Mr. <em>Ingersoll, </em>who asserted <em>then, </em>what we <em>how </em>say is the \u25a0law</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b62-6\">The legislature seem to have been impressed with the same idea; for though they have interfered and restricted the lien of judgments, th.ey have left mortgages upon their original footing. Nor is a mortgage given before, but recorded after a judgment is confessed, to be treated by the judgment creditor as a nullity, and, where he \u25a0has notice of it, he must so regulate (his saleas not to prejudice the mortgagee. <em>Muse </em>v. <em>Letterman, </em>13 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>167. The practice of permitting a younger judgment creditor to sell, and apply the fund, is, but a more direct mode of permitting him to redeem a prior incumbrance to save himself. He has a right to- pay off the prior liens, and repay himself out of the land; which being ultimately responsible -to all creditors in their order, by our practice is rendered immediately available; the principle of equity being, that the party, or fund, <em>ultimately </em>liable to pay, equity renders <em>immediately </em>liable. <em>Nichols </em>v. <em>Posthlewaite, </em>was but a <em>Nisi Prius </em>decision, only reported in <em>Dallas\u2019s Reports ; </em>and the point there and in <em>Barnet </em>v. <em>Washebaugh, </em>was different from that,now before the court. The party who. owned the land sold under the judgments did not create himself the prior lien., In <em>Nichols </em>v. <em>Posthlewaite, </em>the money was In court to pay the legacy, if a, lien, which was the <em>sole </em>question; there was nothing decided, nor any decision called for, as to what the conditio'n of the purchaser was, after the sale; and though the decision, upon the facts, in <em>Barnet </em>v. <em>Washebaugh, </em>the report of which is very unsatisfactory, is right, yet the opinion of the court there delivered was uncalled for; as a very, different principle would have prevented the plaintiff\u2019s recovery in that case.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b61-5\"> See <em>Patch\u2019s, Law of Mortgages, </em>192.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b62-7\">The opinion of the court (Huston, J. being sick, and absent,) was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b62-8\">Tod, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ApA\">- Therecord presents the following <em>case: </em>\u2014 In <em>Septem</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number><em>her, </em>1822, <em>Lenox </em>and <em>Noiris </em>obtained a judgment against <em>Lyman Adams </em>in <em>Scire Facias, </em>upon a mortgage, executed by <em>Adams </em>to them. This mortgage, though executed on the 22d' of <em>December, </em>1815, was admitted not to have , been recorded until the 25th of <em>June, </em>1819. In <em>September, </em>1835, <em>Lenox </em>and <em>Norris </em>brought the present action of <em>Scire Facias, </em>to revive their said judgment, <em>post annum el diem. </em>After there had been judgment by default against <em>Adams, </em>in this <em>second Scire Facias, Willard </em>moved the court to open the judgment, and let him, <em>Willard, </em>into a defence, which was done. The two defendants then, pleaded separately, <em>nul </em>tiel' <em>record, </em>upon which issues were joined. <em>Willard </em>also pleaded a further plea, in which, and in the replication to it, all the facts of this case are contained.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\">[His Honour here read <em>Willard\u2019s </em>plea, and the plaintiffs\u2019 replication.]</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">To this replication, the defendant, <em>Willard, </em>demurred, generally, and the plaintiff joined in demurrer. The judgment of the court was in favour of the' plaintiff below, and the defendant took this-writ of error, and now assigns the following, errors:\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">[His Honour here read the errors assigned.]</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">In the second writ of <em>Scire Facias, </em>there was a mistake in reciting the term of the original judgment; which the court, on the request of the plaintiff below, permitted him to amend. This amendment, and the decision of the court upon the plea of <em>mol tiel record, </em>produced a bill of exceptions from <em>Willard\u2019s </em>counsel; but the first error assigned; has not been insisted, upon here in argument, and we dismiss the matter at once; being of opinion, that the eourt clearly had the power to permit the amendment of the <em>Scire Felicias.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b63-8\">The judgment on the first <em>Scire Facias </em>was confessed by-the defendant, <em>Lyman Adams, </em>on the 17th of <em>September, </em>1822. Th\u00ae amount of it was settled at three hundred and thirty-six dollars and sixty-three and a half cents. The mortgage produced was of th\u00ae date already mentioned, to secure payment of a bond of nine hundred and eighty-seven dollars and sixty-six cents, conditioned for the payment of four hundred and ninety-three dollars and eighty-three cents. On what day, or from what time interest was to be paid, does not appear. Thus it appears, that the judgment, upon which the land was sold by the sheriff, was subsequent to the recording of the mortgage of the plaintiff below; but the judgment, towards satisfaction of which, the money was applied by the sheriff, was prior to the mortgage. There was judgment entered on the mortgage long prior to the sale by the sheriff, and against that sheriff\u2019s sale there was ho allegation of fraud. As to the distinction which has been made, depending upon the fact, that though the land was actually sold upon a later judgment, yet that the money raised by the sale was appropriated to a judgment entered prior to the recording of the mortgage, it was not much pressed in the ar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>gument, and we shall not rely upon it in the decision. Then, on this general demurrer, the question comes up directly, whether the title of a prior mortgagee, and the lien of his mortgage, are devested and extinguished by a sale of the land under a younger judgment. Perhaps it is a question which now comes for the first time before this court for a direct decision. Yet, I apprehend, that incidentally and indirectly, it has often arisen, and often been decided. I have endeavoured to make a collection of all the cases bearing upon the subject, from <em>Yeates </em>and <em>Binney\u2019s Reports, </em>to <em>Barnet </em>v. <em>Washebaugh, </em>16 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>410. Most of these cases were cited in the argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">In <em>Petty </em>v. <em>Beauvarlet, </em>1 <em>Binn. </em>97, decided in 1804, there was a rule on the sheriff -to bring money into court, to which he made return, \u201c that with the money he had paid off several <em>judgments and mortgages </em>upon the premises sold, which <em>beingprior </em>to the judgment in this case, were entitled to prior satisfaction; and, that he had charged a poundage upon the different sums so paid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\"><em>Per Curiam. </em>\u2014 \u201c The construction of that clause, (viz. of the fee bill,) has uniformly allowed to the sheriff poundage upon the payment of all <em>prior judgments and mortgages. </em>He must, therefore, take his costs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b64-8\">That this decision was accordant with the sense of,the community and of the bar, is strongly shown by the ease of <em>Browne </em>v. <em>Browne, </em>1 <em>Broione\u2019s Rep. </em>97, where some contested items in a sheriff\u2019s bill of costs were referred to two gentlemen among the most practical and experienced of the profession. The sheriff had sold land under the act of assembly of the 11th of <em>Jlpril, </em>1799, after the execution of a writ of partition. Objection was made to an item of ten dollars and some cents, charged and paid by the sheriff for <em>searches of judgments and mortgages. </em>The, referees approved the charge, and gave these reasons: \u2014 '\u201cIt appears to us necessary, for the sheriff\u2019s security, to make these searches, as he could not safely distribute the money arising from the sale among the parties without ascertaining what liens are upon the estate. We have no doubt, that the sheriff is entitled to a reasonable and proper allowance for the trouble, risk, and responsibility, in performing this duty; and we can perceive no difference in any of these respects, between such a sale as this, and a sale under judgment and <em>execution. </em>This opinion seems to be sanctioned by the case of <em>Petty </em>v. <em>Beauvarlet, </em>in the Supreme Court, wherein the court allowed poundage to the sheriff on the payment of <em>the judgments and mortgages </em>prior to the judgment and execution on which, the defendant\u2019s land was sold, although the fee bill declares, that no poundage shall be paid for more than the real debt, and also declares it to be illegal for any officer to demand greater fees than are specified in the act of assembly, for any service to be done by him; but does not notice the poundage on payment of such <em>judgments and mortgages </em>prior to the plaintiff who sells.\u201d This award was confirmed by the court, with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>approbation of all, as far as appears. Eveni though this c\u00e1se should not be held as a precedent in law, yet it seems to me, nothing can more .clearly show how notorious is the rule, that in every judicial sale in <em>Pennsylvania, </em>the land goes to the purchaser clear of all liens- of <em>judgments and mortgages, </em>and that out of the purchase money, the sheriff, at his own risk, is to pay off all those liens, according to their priority, insomuch, though the act of assembly, about partition, makes no mention of liens, yet by mere analogy, drawn from the notorious usuage of the commonwealth, an allowance was adjudged, in this case, to the sheriff, for the fees paid for searches of <em>judgments and mortgages, </em>the owners of which might afterwards call upon him for their money. I refer also to <em>Shoemaker </em>v. <em>Houtford, </em>1 <em>Browne\u2019s </em>Rep. 251.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">In the case of <em>The Bank of N. America </em>v. <em>Fitzsimons, </em>3 <em>Binn. </em>358, Tilghman, C. J. says, \u201c it has been a practice of .long standing in this state, where the sheriff sells-land by virtue of an execution to sell it for its full value, and apply the money to the discharge of tho.se liens.\u201d The consequence was, that the sheriff retained the money in his hands till he could ascertain the amount of.old judgments. In <em>Wall </em>v. <em>Lloyd\u2019s Executors, </em>1 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>320, Tilghman, C. J. says, \u201c I know, that by the practice of -this court,sheriffs have been allowed poundage out of the money they pay, not only for the satisfaction of the debt of the plaintiff in the execution, but also of other judgments by-which the land was bound.\u201d And in the same case, Yeates, J.\u2019says, \u201cThiscourt has determined, <em>Petry </em>v. <em>Beauvarlet, </em>1 <em>Binn. </em>97, that the construction of the act of assembly of the 25th <em>o\u00ed April, </em>1795, uniformly has been, to allow the sheriff poundage upon all prior <em>judgments and mortgages. </em>And I take it, that the uniform practice for fifty\" years past, has been, that the sheriff has been allowed poundage for <em>all debts </em>which he has paid on sales.\u201d The case of <em>Nichols </em>v. <em>Postlethwaite, 3 Dall. </em>131, would, I apprehend, if any question were yet remaining as to the usage of <em>Pennsylvania, </em>requiring all liens to be paid on sheriffs\u2019 sales, end the doubt. There it was expressly decided, that legacies charged by will, on lands sold by the sheriff on a subsequent judgment, should be paid out of the purchase money, which goes far beyond any payment of a prior mortgage. It is argued, that this is but a <em>Nisi Prius </em>decision, and that the same case is not at all mentioned in <em>Yeates\u2019s Reports. </em>As to authority, the judges appear t\u00f3 have been Bradford and Shippen; and Judge Yeates reported no decision, made at a circuit where he did not attend. Besides, the decision in <em>Nichols </em>v. <em>Postlethwaite, </em>is cited with express approbation by Duncan, J. in. <em>Gause </em>v. <em>Wiley, </em>4 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>535, by Tilghman, C. J. in <em>The Commonmealth v. Alexander, 14 </em>Serg. &amp; <em>Rawle, </em>263, and by the whole court in <em>Barnet </em>v. <em>Washebaugh, </em>16 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>413, in which the very same point was decided. It appears difficult' to state any reason why prior legacies shall be paid out ,of monies raised by a sheriff\u2019s sale of the land on which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>they are charged, and yet, that prior judgments, or prior mortgages, shall not be paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">I am not aware of any decision of this court, contradicting, the usage which has been mentioned, and which, I think, there is reason to believe, has existed in this state, beyond the memory of man. The incidental <em>dicta </em>of the judges, however, have varied very much indeed. Judge Yeates seems to have taken the lead in support of what he deemed the ancient usage; and his reasons, which may be found in the case of <em>Keen </em>v. <em>Swaine et al. </em>3 <em>Yeates, </em>561, cannot, in my opinion, be easily and satisfactorily answered. Judge Brackenridge was foremost on the other side. On every occasion he seems to have declared his mind unequivocally, that by a sheriff's sale of lands, all prior liens, whether judgments or mortgages, are left wholly untouched.; and be gives his reasons most fully in his <em>Miscellanies, page </em>258; and from some of the <em>dicta </em>in the books from, the judges incidentally,, it seems probable, that one or more of them were of the same opinion with-Brackenridge, J. But this, it appears to me, could-,not have lasted long.. In the case of <em>Patterson </em>v. <em>Sample, </em>4 <em>Yeates, </em>308, there was a mortgage, and the land having been sold under a subsequent judgment, there was an. application by the mortgagee to receive his money from the sheriff. The case was h\u00e9ard before Smith, J., and the only..g.round'upon which that judge seems to have placed the case was, the recording \u00a9f the mortgage deed within six months. The later cases on the subject are still more conclusive. In <em>The Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Alexander, 1</em>4 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>257, it was decided, Tilghman, C. J., pronouncing the opinion of the court, not only that a prior judgment was to be paid out of the purchase money accruing from a sheriff\u2019s-sale, but that a judgment still older, and against another person, who-had been-the preceding owner of the land, should also be paid. Then, as to mortgages;\u2019in <em>M'Call </em>v. <em>Lenox, 9 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 302, the </em>land was sold on a judgment. Without \u00bfny question, as far as-appears, the money was applied by the sheriff to the satisfaction, of a mortgage, and the residue as far as it would go,, to a second mortgage, both mortgages being prior to the judgment. The last two cases are full of other matter, leading, .as it seems to me, to the same conclusion. That a mortgage is but a record evidence of a, debt, and entitled on this question to no prerogative whatever above a judgment, independent of the express authorities cited, 1 refer to <em>Wentz and Wife </em>v. <em>De Haven, </em>1 <em>Serg. Rawle, </em>312, and <em>Porter\u2019s Executor </em>v. <em>Neff, </em>11 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>223. Other cases'might be cited to the same purport, but it seems to be unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">Judgment reversed, and judgment for the plaintiffs in error on the demurrer.. /</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
