The above law was revived by the aet of the 11th of <em>March, </em>1815. <em>Frederick Smith, William S.

Every person entitled to vote for borough officers, is bound to contribute in some way. The qualification is, <em>\u201c </em>Entitled to vote for members <em>of </em>the legislature, who have resided twelve months in the borough.-\u201d <em>Section second of the act of incorporation of </em>1803. One who has n\u00f3 property,-can contribute only by a poll tax. An .appeal for an unreasonable tax is given to the Quarter . Sessions. Property is not the exclusive subject of taxation. No restriction to property is-contained in the act of incorporation.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b127-7\">\n<em>Crawford, contra.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AIU4\">\u2014 Young men are migratory; and on the principle- contended for, may be .taxed in different towns in the same year. The limitation on taxation, is in reference to <em>property, </em>and the power must be supposed to have been given in reference to property. Here, if they can tax the person, there is no limitation. No power exists to tax, but what is expressly given. <em>Piper </em>v. <em>Singer, </em>4 <em>Serg. </em>&amp; <em>Rawle, </em>354.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b127-8\">The opinion of the court (Tod, J. dissenting,) was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b127-9\">Gibson, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AK4\">\u2014 A power to tax ought to rest on something more substantial than implication. But the town council has express power \u201c to assess, apportion, and appropriate such taxes as shall be determined by a majority of them,\u201d to be necessary for carrying their ordinances into effect; and this with no restriction, or limitation, but that the tax-shall not exceed a cent on the dollar. It has been said, the nature of the power is indicated by the nature of the limitation, which has regard to property exclusively. But it by no means follows, that the legislature had nothing in view but-the subject of the power, as indicated by the limitation; for the act of as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>sembly of 1799, in which are enumerated the subjects of taxation for county purposes, and subject to a like limitation, contains also, an express power to tax the person of every single freeman. There is nothing in the nature of taxation, which' necessarily restricts it to property; and, \u2019where it is exercised for particular .purposes, under \u00a1\u00e1 grant which contains no enumeration of. its objects, the enumeration in the act of assembly of 1799, being a.general law, must be assumed as the basis of,the grant,'which.otherwise ivould be without bound; or limit. .As regards this corporation,- there is a peculiar fitness in this; because, taxation being the basis of our- elective franchise, and the corporate qualifications' of the electors being declared to be the sanie as those of the electors of members of the general assembly, the legislature would seem to have indicated, that each should be respectively subject to the same r.ule and measure of assessment. Here, then, the plaintiff below, was \u00e1ssessed as a single freeman, without assessing his property or profession; andit, therefore, seerns the corporation did not transcend its powers.</p>\n<p id=\"AXZ\">Judgment-reversed, and judgment for the defendant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
