D. 182-, to give the said <em>Richard Miles </em>a receipt in full of the debt, interest, and costs, for which the said execution had issued; and the said <em>John Monks </em>did then, in consideration of his being thus indebted, and liable to pay to the said <em>Richard Miles, </em>execute a receipt in full, to the said <em>Richard Miles, </em>for the amount of debt, interest, and costis, due on the execution of the said <em>Henry Richwine, </em>against the said <em>Richard Miles: </em>That <em>no money was paid </em>by the said <em>Richard Miles </em>to the said <em>John Monks, </em>in satisfaction of the said execution against him, the said <em>Richard Miles: </em>That afterwards, to wit: on the 11th day of <em>February, </em>A.

D. 1824, the said <em>Richard Miles </em>entered the said judgment so obtained before <em>Elisha Boyle, </em>Esq., upon the docket of the Court of Common Pleas of <em>Cumberland </em>county, whereon he caused execution to issue; upon which, the real estate of the said <em>John Monies </em>was levied and sold, and the amount of the said judgment made and paid to the said <em>Richard Miles: </em>That since that time, the said <em>John Monies </em>has taken the benefit of the insolvent laws of this commonwealth.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b200-6\">This suit originated by a <em>Scire Facias, </em>issued upon the aforesaid judgment in favour of <em>Henry Richioine, </em>against the said <em>Richard Miles, </em>to show cause why execution should not issue against him, the said <em>Richard Miles, </em>for the amount of debt, interest, and costs of the said judgment; upon which, an appeal was entered to the Court of Common .Pleas of the said county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b200-7\">If upon these facts, the court should be of opinion, that the plaintiff is, without regard to the form of action, entitled to recover, the judgment to be entered for the plaintiff for forty-six dollars sixteen cents, debt, with interest from the 6th of <em>June, </em>1823, and costs of suit; but if the plaintiff is not entitled to recover, the judgment to be entered for the defendant.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b200-8\"><em>Watts, </em>for the plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ajq\">\u2014 A constable may give a receipt for a debt, and render himself liable, without the money. Even, if actually received, the plaintiff would have nothing to trust to but his personal responsibility. Where constables have mutual executions against each other, they may set them off; because, it would be idle ceremony to receive on the\u2019 one, and pay back on the other.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b200-9\"><em>Penrose, contra, </em>was stopped by the court.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b200-10\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b200-11\">Gibson, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AXg\">\u2014 It is settled, that an officer cannot apply an execution in his hands to the satisfaction of his own debt. In <em>Codwise </em>v. <em>Field, </em>9 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>263, the coroner having a <em>Capias ad Satisfaciendum </em>against the sheriff\u2019, to whom he was indebted, gave him a receipt in full, and engaged to settle- the amount with the plaintiff, but failed to do so; and it was held, that this arrangement did not discharge the execution, actual payment alone being competent to produce that effect. So, in the Bank of <em>Orange v. </em>Wakeman, 1 Cowen, 46, where a sheriff\u2019s deputy took the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>dant\u2019s negotiable note, gave a receipt, and returned the execution, satisfied; it was determined that the defendant was still liable. As regards the debt due by <em>Monies </em>to <em>Miles, </em>on his own right, these cases are exactly in point. But the case of two constables agreeing to set off executions in their hands, against each other, is clearly within the principle established by them; inasmuch as such an arrangement would substitute the officer for the defendant. It might not, therefore, be an idle ceremony, as it has been called at the bar, to enforce the payment of money on the one execution, to have it paid back the next moment on the other. If one of the defendants were insolvent, and the other not, the set-off would effect an injurious change of liability, by substituting an insolvent constable for a solvenfdcfendant; and so, <em>viceversa. </em>To avoid this, and other mischiefs, the law will not endure the mingling of private transactions with official duties. Had <em>Monies </em>collected the money on the plaintiff\u2019s execution, he might, no doubt, have embezzled it; but he might also have proved faithful to his trust; and in the worst event, the plaintiff could have been reduced only to the situation in which the attempted arrangement, had it been successful, would have left him. <em>Miles, </em>therefore, cannot be permitted to obtain his debt from <em>Monks, </em>and at the same time, pay a judgment creditor, at the expense of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
