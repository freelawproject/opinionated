On the 22d <em>March, </em>1826, the justice gave judgment for the plaintiff; on the 29th of the same month, the defendant appealed, and entered into the recognizance required bylaw. On the 30th of the following. Afoy, Le filed a transcript of the judgment of the justice in the office of the pr\u00f3thonotary of the Court of Common Pleas. Prior to the filing of the transcript,, viz. on the 19th of <em>April, </em>1826, on motion of the plaintiff\u2019s attorney, and affidavit of special circumstances filed, the court granted a rule to take the depositions of ancient, infirm and going witnesses, on twenty-four hours\u2019 notice. Due notice was given to the defendant, that the deposition of <em>Freeman Latimer, </em>a witness for the plaintiff, would be taken before alderman. <em>Badger, </em>on the 25th <em>April, </em>1826, and at the appointed time, the deposition was taken by the plaintiff, <em>ex parte, </em>the defendant not attending.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b333-8\">On the trial in the Court of Common Pleas, .the plaintiff, after having proved that a subpoena had issued for the witness, and that .he was unable to attend, in consequence of illness, offered in evidence his deposition, taken before alderman <em>Badger, </em>as above mentioned. The defendant\u2019s counsel objected to its being read: but the court overruled the objection, and admitted the deposition,, which was the error now assigned. ,</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b333-9\"><em>Hopkins, </em>for the plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A0W\">referred to the act of the 20th of <em>March, </em>1810, sect. 4. <em>Purd. Dig. </em>452. <em>Stotesbury </em>v. <em>Covenhoven, </em>1 <em>Dall. </em>164.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b333-10\"><em>Brewster, contra, </em>was stopped by the court.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b333-11\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b333-12\">Huston, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Anr\">\u2014 On the 22d of <em>March, </em>1826, Justice Loughiiead gave judgment for <em>Stewart </em>against <em>Harlan, </em>the defendant below. On the 29th of <em>March, </em>the defendant appealed to the Common Pleas, and gave bail according to law, but did not file the appeal in the Common Pleas until 30th <em>May, </em>1826, being the first day of the term next after the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-13\">On the 19th of <em>April, </em>the plaintiff carried a certified copy of the judgment of the justice, and of the appeal taken, into the Court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>Common Pleas, and an affidavit stating' that a material witness was about to leave'the state. . A special rule to take depositions was granted: notice of taking the depositions was duly given, and the ' deposition regularly taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">At the trial of the cause, the witness had returned to this country, and had been duly summoned to attend the trial,' but, on proof that he was confined to bed by sickness, the deposition was offered, and received by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">Among the e\u00e1rliest of our reports, 1 Dali, 164, we find, under-similar circumstances, a rule granted to take the deposition of a witness before the return of the writ. And again, in&lt;the same book, <em>p: </em>251, this is recognised. If such were not the practice in a'seaport, intolerable hardship and loss would be the consequence. By the fourth section of the act of 20th <em>March, </em>1810, appeals are to be, in court, subject to the same rules as other actions. There is no good \u2019 reason why we should disturb a practice of, So long standing in .that court. There is no error in the admission of this deposition , on the facts stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">Judgment, affirmed..</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
