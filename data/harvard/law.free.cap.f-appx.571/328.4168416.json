Siebert now appeals the denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition in which he argued that he was entitled to credit for time served during his release on bail to home confinement. Although he also asserted in his petition that the district court \u201cfailed to convey to him the consequences of electing bail\u201d and that the oral pronouncement of sentence conflicted with the written judgment regarding the term of supervised release, he does not challenge the district court\u2019s resolution of those claims and has therefore abandoned them on appeal. <em>See Longoria v. Dretke, </em>507 F.3d 898, 901 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-21\">As for Siebert\u2019s argument that he was entitled to credit towards his sentence for the time he served in home confinement, his argument is without merit. <em>See Reno v. Koray, </em>515 U.S. 50, 57-65, 115 S.Ct. 2021, 132 L.Ed.2d 46 (1995). Before surrendering to the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) for service of his sentence, Sie-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>bert was released on bail, subject to home confinement. Because he was not committed to the custody of the Attorney General or subject to the BOP\u2019s control, he was not in \u201cofficial detention\u201d for purposes of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3585(b), which provides that a defendant is entitled to credit toward the service of a term of imprisonment for any time he has served in \u201cofficial detention prior to the date the sentence commences.\u201d <em>See Koray, </em>515 U.S. at 57-58, 115 S.Ct. 2021. Thus, Siebert was not entitled to credit against his sentence for the time spent in home confinement. <em>Id. </em>at 58-65, 115 S.Ct. 2021. Further, although Siebert points to the Sentencing Guidelines and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3588 in support of his argument, none of the provisions Siebert cites for support relate to whether he served time in \u201cofficial detention\u201d prior to the date his sentence commenced. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3585(b); <em>Koray, </em>515 U.S. at 58-65, 115 S.Ct. 2021.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b352-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
