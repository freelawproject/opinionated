In his petition, Mejia Chavez argues that the agency erred because its determination was not supported by substantial evidence. Particularly given the deference owed the BIA, we see no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-23\">\u201cWe review only the [BIA\u2019s] decision, except to the extent that it expressly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>adopts the IJ\u2019s opinion. Insofar as the [BIA] adopts the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we will review the IJ\u2019s decision as well.\u201d <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001) (citation omitted). We may only review those issues ruled upon by the BIA. <em>See Donawa v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>735 F.3d 1275, 1279 (11th Cir.2013). Factual determinations are reviewed under the \u201chighly deferential substantial evidence test,\u201d which requires us to \u201cview the record evidence in the light most favorable to the agency\u2019s decision and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of that decision.\u201d <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1026-27 (11th Cir.2004) <em>(en banc). </em>We \u201cmust affirm the BIA\u2019s decision if it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>D-Muhumed v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>388 F.3d 814, 818 (11th Cir.2004). \u201cTo reverse the ... fact findings, we must find that the record not only supports reversal, but compels it.\u201d <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2003). We review the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s legal conclusions <em>de novo. Kazemzadeh v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>577 F.3d 1341, 1350 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b887-5\">An alien who arrives in or is present in the United States may apply for asylum. INA \u00a7 208(a)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(1). The Attorney General or the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security has discretion to grant asylum if the alien meets the INA\u2019s definition of a \u201crefugee.\u201d INA \u00a7 208(b)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1). A \u201crefugee\u201d is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b887-6\">any person who is outside any country of such person\u2019s nationality or, in the case of a person having no nationality, is outside any country in which such person last habitually resided, and who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b887-9\">INA \u00a7 101(a)(42)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). The asylum applicant carries the burden of proving statutory \u201crefugee\u201d status. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a); <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1284. To establish eligibility, the alien must, with specific and credible evidence, establish (1) past persecution on account of a statutorily listed factor or (2) a well-founded fear that the statutorily listed factor will cause future persecution. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b); <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1287.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-11\">\u201c[Persecution is an extreme concept, requiring more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation, and ... mere harassment does not amount to persecution.\u201d <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1231 (11th Cir.2005) (quotations and alteration omitted). Moreover, the persecution must be personal to the applicant \u2014 \u201cthreatening acts or harm against other family members does not constitute or imply persecution of the petitioner where there has been no threat or harm directed against the petitioner.\u201d <em>Rodriguez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>735 F.3d 1302, 1308-09 (11th Cir.2013); <em>see also In re A-K-, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 275, 278 (BIA 2007) (persecution must be \u201ctied to the applicant personally\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b887-12\">An applicant must also establish a nexus between the persecution and a ground listed in the statute. INA \u00a7 101(a)(42)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A) (defining a \u201crefugee\u201d as a person who cannot or will not return to their country because of past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution \u201con account of\u2019 a protected ground). The applicant must demonstrate that one of the enumerated grounds \u201cwas or will be at least one central reason\u201d for the persecution. INA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>\u00a7 208(b)(l)(B)(i), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b888-5\">The statutory grounds for asylum specifically include \u201cmembership in a particular social group, or [a] political opinion.\u201d INA \u00a7 101(a)(42)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). \u201cPersecution on account of political opinion is persecution on account of the <em>victim\u2019s </em>political opinion, not the persecutor\u2019s.\u201d <em>Sanchez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>392 F.3d 434, 437-38 (11th Cir.2004) (emphasis in original) (alterations omitted). The key question is whether the persecutor is acting <em>because of </em>the applicant\u2019s political opinion. <em>See id. </em>at 438. We have said that \u201cevidence that either is consistent with acts of private violence or the petitioner\u2019s failure to cooperate with guerillas, or that merely shows that a person has been the victim of criminal activity, does not constitute evidence of persecution based on a statutorily protected ground.\u201d <em>Ruiz v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1258 (11th Cir.2006); <em>see also Sanchez, </em>392 F.3d at 438 (petitioner failed to establish a nexus between her alleged political opinion and the guerillas\u2019 alleged persecution when she established merely that the guerillas harassed her because of her failure to cooperate).</p>\n<p id=\"b888-6\">Congress has not defined what constitutes a \u201cparticular social group\u201d under the INA; and we must defer to the BIA\u2019s reasonable interpretation of that term, pursuant to <em>Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984). <em>Castillo-Arias v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>446 F.3d 1190, 1195-96 (11th Cir.2006). In <em>Castillo-Arias, </em>we approved the BIA\u2019s definition of a \u201cparticular social group\u201d as a group of persons who \u201cshare a common, immutable characteristic ... such as sex, color, or kinship ties, or in some circumstances ... a shared past experience such as former military leadership or land ownership.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1193, 1196-97 (citing <em>Matter of Acosta, </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 211, 233 (BIA 1985), <em>overruled on other grounds by Matter of Mogharrabi, </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 439, 447 (BIA 1987)). \u201c[T]his characteristic must be one that the members of the group either cannot change, or should not be required to change because it is fundamental to their individual identities or consciences.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1193 (quotations omitted). Reasoning that membership in a particular social group should not be defined so broadly that it becomes \u201ca \u2018catch-all\u2019 for all persons alleging persecution who do not fit elsewhere,\u201d we affirmed the BIA\u2019s determination that noncriminal informants working against the Colombian drug cartels are not a particular social group. <em>See id. </em>at 1198 (\u201cThe risk of persecution alone does not create a particular social group within the meaning of the INA, as virtually the entire population of Colombia is a potential subject of persecution by the cartel.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b888-8\">To qualify as a \u201cparticular social group,\u201d a group must (1) \u201cshare a common, immutable characteristic,\u201d (2) not be defined by the risk of persecution alone, and (3) not be \u201ctoo numerous or inchoate.\u201d <em>Rodriguez, </em>735 F.3d at 1310. In addition, a particular social group must have \u201csocial visibility\u201d (which the BIA recently renamed \u201csocial distinction\u201d), which requires a group to be \u201csocially distinct within the society in question,\u201d that is, it must be perceived as a distinct group by society. <em>See Matter of W-G-R- </em>26 I. &amp; N. Dec. 208, 212 (BIA 2014); <em>Matter of M-E-V-G-, </em>26 I. &amp; N. Dec. 227, 237, 240 (BIA 2014). Mere resistance to a violent group does not confer social distinction. <em>See Matter of E-A-G-, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 591, 594-95 (BIA 2008) (holding that the proposed \u201csocial group\u201d of people \u201cwho resist joining gangs [has] not been shown to be part of a socially visible group within Honduran society\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b889-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>To establish a well-founded fear of future persecution, the applicant must show either (1) past persecution that creates a presumption of a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d of future persecution, or (2) that there is a \u201creasonable possibility\u201d of suffering persecution if he returns to his home country. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.18(b)(1), (2). If the applicant is entitled to the presumption based on past persecution, that presumption may be rebutted if, for example, a fundamental change of circumstances has happened such that the applicant would no longer have a well-founded fear of persecution in his or her country. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 208.13(b)(1)(i)(A). The applicant must demonstrate a well-founded fear of future persecution that is \u201csubjectively genuine and objectively reasonable.\u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1289. \u201cThe subjective component is generally satisfied by the applicant\u2019s credible testimony that he or she genuinely fears persecution[,]\u201d and \u201c[i]n most cases, the objective prong can be fulfilled either by establishing past persecution or that he or she has a good reason to fear future persecution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations omitted). The applicant must present \u201cspecific, detailed facts showing a good reason to fear that he or she will be <em>singled out </em>for persecution on account of [the statutorily protected factor].\u201d <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1286 (11th Cir.2005) (quotation omitted) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b889-4\">To qualify for withholding of removal, the applicant bears the burden of showing that his life or freedom would be threatened in the proposed country of removal: threatened on account of a protected ground. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 241(b)(3)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b). The applicant meets this burden by showing that it is \u201cmore likely than not\u201d he or she will be persecuted or tortured upon being returned to their country. <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1232. This standard is a more stringent one than the one required for asylum eligibility; therefore, if an applicant is unable to meet the \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d standard for asylum, he generally is unable to qualify for withholding of removal. <em>See Kazemzadeh, </em>577 F.3d at 1352.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-8\">To qualify for protection under CAT, the applicant bears the burden of showing that it is more likely than not that he would be tortured if returned to the proposed country of removal. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2). To obtain CAT relief, the applicant must demonstrate that the torture would be inflicted by the government or that the government would be aware of the torture and allow it to happen. <em>See Reyes-Sanchez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>369 F.3d 1239, 1242 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b889-9\">Substantial evidence supports the denial of Mejia Chavez\u2019s asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT claims. First, the record does not compel the finding that Mejia Chavez was personally persecuted on account of a protected ground. Mejia Chavez did not demonstrate a connection between his political opinion and the guerillas\u2019 mistreatment of him and his family. <em>See Ruiz, </em>440 F.3d at 1258. Furthermore, the agency\u2019s determining that the \u201csocial group\u201d proposed by Mejia Chavez \u2014 people affiliated with the Guatemalan army and government \u2014 is no \u201cparticular social group\u201d under the meaning of the INA is free of error: the purported \u201csocial group\u201d is both too inchoate, numerous, and not socially distinctive. Second, substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s determination that Mejia Chavez\u2019s fear of persecution upon return to Guatemala is not objectively reasonable because of the passage of time and the changed circumstances \u2014 for example, the Peace Accords \u2014 in Guatemala; he therefore cannot show a well-founded fear of future persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>Because Mejia Chavez failed to carry his burden for asylum, he necessarily failed to carry the higher burden required to qualify for withholding of removal. In addition, nothing evidences torture of Mejia Chavez or evidences that the <em>government of </em>Guatemala would participate or acquiesce in such torture; so the record fails to compel reversal of the agency\u2019s determination that Mejia Chavez was unentitled to CAT relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-4\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
