The amendment relied upon for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief must lower the \u201capplicable guideline range.\u201d U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 1B1.10 cmt. n. 1(A) (2013). If the amendment lowers the applicable guideline range, the district court may reduce the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment, but generally not to a term that is less than the minimum of the amended guideline range.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 lB1.10(a), (b)(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">In 2008, Pittman pled guilty to conspiracy to distribute 50 grams or more of cocaine base (Count 1) and possession of a firearm during and in relation to a drug-trafficking crime (Count 5). At sentencing, the district court imposed a 200-month sentence, consisting of a 140-month downward-variance sentence as to Count 1 and a mandatory consecutive 60-month sentence as to Count 5. In 2011, Amendment 750 to the Sentencing Guidelines, which applies retroactively, had the effect of lowering the \u201capplicable guideline range\u201d on Count 1 to an amended guideline range of between 168 and 210 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-6\">Pittman concedes that \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief is unavailable to him because his original sentence on Count 1 is lower than the minimum of the amended guideline range on Count 1. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1B1.10(b)(2). Pittman argues, however, that \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2) is invalid. Specifically, Pittman argues that the current version of \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2) violates the Ex Post Facto Clause, exceeds the U.S. Sentencing Commission\u2019s authority, and violates the separation-of-powers doctrine. Pittman acknowledges that we rejected these arguments in <em>United States v. Colon, </em>707 F.3d 1255 (11th Cir.2013). He raises them here solely in order to preserve the issues for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-9\">The government has filed a motion for summary affirmance and to stay the briefing schedule. Summary disposition is appropriate where, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cthe position of one of the parties is clearly right as a matter of law so that there can be no substantial question as to the outcome of the case, or where, as is more frequently the case, the appeal is frivolous.\u201d <em>Groendyke Transp., Inc. v. Davis, </em>406 F.2d 1158, 1162 (5th Cir.1969); <em>see United States v. Martinez, </em>407 F.3d 1170, 1173-74 (11th Cir.2005) (construing the defendant\u2019s \u201cunconventional\u201d motion as a motion for summary reversal, granting the motion, vacating the defendant\u2019s sentence, and remanding the case for resentencing where the district court had committed plain error by treating the Sentencing Guidelines as mandatory).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-10\">Pittman concedes that our precedent in <em>Colon </em>squarely forecloses his arguments about the validity of \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(2). <em>See United States v. Lawson, </em>686 F.3d 1317, 1319 (11th Cir.2012) (per curiam) (\u201cWe are bound by a prior panel opinion until the opinion\u2019s holding is overruled by the Supreme Court or by our Court sitting <em>en banc.\u201d). </em>Accordingly, we GRANT the government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance and DENY AS MOOT the government\u2019s motion to stay the briefing schedule.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b848-7\">. This general limitation is subject to an exception that is not applicable here. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 1B1.10(b)(2)(B).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
