The issue on appeal is whether Tra-han\u2019s claims were properly removed from Texas court. Trahan argues that his claims arise under workers\u2019 compensation law such that removal is precluded by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1445(c). The district court rejected his argument, denying a timely motion to remand. That court, however, then dismissed all claims pending the resolution of relevant administrative proceedings.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The two orders issued on the same day, and both were rendered without opinion. Because we find that the district court erred in concluding that \u201cthis case does not arise under the workers\u2019 compensation laws,\u201d we reverse the remand denial, vacate the dismissal, and instruct the district court to return the case to the state of Texas.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-23\">The permissibility of removal is a question of law that this court reviews <em>de novo. Sherrod v. Am. Airlines, Inc., </em>132 F.3d 1112, 1117 (5th Cir.1998). \u201cA civil action in any State court arising under the workmen\u2019s compensation laws of such State may not be removed to any district court of the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1445(c). \u201cSection 1445(c) expresses a public policy favoring the litigation of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>civil action arising under the workers\u2019 compensation laws of the state in state court.\u201d <em>Unida v. Levi Strauss &amp; Co., </em>986 F.2d 970, 974 (5th Cir.1998). Therefore, \u201c[b]eeause Congress intended that all cases arising under a state\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation scheme remain in state court, we believe that we should read section 1445(c) broadly to further that purpose.\u201d <em>Trevino v. Ramos, </em>197 F.3d 777, 781 (5th Cir.1999) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">Bearing these principles in mind, we turn to Trahan\u2019s claims. First, Trahan\u2019s complaint lists a series of requests for declaratory judgment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-5\">Trahan seeks a declaratory judgment against Liberty that: (1) Liberty contractually waived its rights under Texas Labor Code \u00a7 417.001 <em>et. seq., </em>to recover from Trahan the amount of benefits it has paid in the past, or a credit against future benefits; (2) that Liberty is not entitled to reimbursement for the payment of medical expenses out of the settlement proceeds recovered by Tra-han, pursuant to Texas Labor Code \u00a7 417.002(a); (3) Liberty is not entitled to a statutory credit for the future payment of medical benefits pursuant to Texas Labor Code \u00a7 417.002(b); and (4) Liberty is required to continue paying benefits to Trahan pursuant to applicable Texas Law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">Compl. \u00b6 10. These requests revolve around the payment of benefits and the subrogation of the payor, both of which unambiguously arise under Texas workers\u2019 compensation law. <em>See </em>Tex. Labor Code \u00a7\u00a7 409 (regarding payment of benefits), 417 (regarding subrogation). It is of no consequence that the dispute is embedded in a declaratory action, as this court does not allow declaratory relief to be used as \u201can \u2018end run\u2019 around removal procedures and jurisprudence.\u201d <em>Tex. Employers\u2019 Ins. Ass\u2019n v. Jackson, </em>862 F.2d 491, 508 n. 24 (5th Cir.1988). Trahan is asserting paradigmatic workers\u2019 compensation claims under Texas law, and removal is therefore improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-8\">Trahan\u2019s only other claim also arises out of Texas workers\u2019 compensation law. Tra-han pleads a breach of good faith:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-9\">Liberty is liable to Trahan for breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing and violations of the Texas Insurance Code. Liberty\u2019s acts and/or omissions were a producing and/or proximate case of Trahan\u2019s injuries and damages.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b344-10\">Compl. \u00b6 11. For more than two decades, Texas courts recognized an aggrieved beneficiary\u2019s allegations of \u201cbad faith\u201d as arising under the Texas Insurance Code and state common law, and not under workers\u2019 compensation law. <em>See </em>Tex. Ins.Code \u00a7\u00a7 541.060, 542.003 (referring to duty of good faith in insurance practices); <em>Aranda v. Ins. Co. N. Am., </em>748 S.W.2d 210, 212-14 (Tex.1988) (recognizing independent cause of action under common law), <em>overruled by Tex. Mut. Ins. Co. v. Ruttiger, </em>381 S.W.3d 430, 433 (Tex.2012). Accordingly, we allowed removal of such claims. <em>See generally Patin v. Allied Signal, Inc., </em>77 F.3d 782 (5th Cir.1996). Yet due to subsequent amendments to the Texas Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, the statute now expressly addresses the duty of 3 good faith and fair dealing and specifies the remedy for breach of that duty. <em>See </em>Tex. Labor Code \u00a7 416.002. Consequently, and as explained in detail by the Texas Supreme Court, claims of bad faith no longer arise outside of the workers\u2019 compensation laws. <em>See Ruttiger, </em>381 S.W.3d 430 at 445-51 (explaining that administrative remedies now afforded by the workers\u2019 compensation system have \u201celiminated the need for a judicially imposed cause of action\u201d and obviated claims brought pursuant to Texas Insurance Code \u00a7\u00a7 541.060 and 542.003). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>Accordingly, removal of Trahan\u2019s claim is precluded by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1445(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">We conclude that Trahan has not stated any claim that \u201cis legally distinct from and independent of any claims arising under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.\u201d <em>Williams v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>741 F.3d 617, 622 (5th Cir.2014). Removal of the case is therefore improper. Accordingly, the remand denial is REVERSED and the dismissal order is VACATED. We REMAND with instructions to return the case to the state court from which it was removed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b343-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b343-19\">. It is unclear whether the court was dismissing the claims outright or issuing a stay pending the outcome of the proceedings. Because the case should have been remanded, we vacate the order irrespective of the court\u2019s intent. We do not reach the apparent issue of administrative exhaustion, leaving that question to the state.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
