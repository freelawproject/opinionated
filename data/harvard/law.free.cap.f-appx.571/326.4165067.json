Stoker argues that the district court plainly erred when it admitted a demonstrative exhibit during opening statements, and that there is insufficient evidence to support the jury verdict. Because the district court did not plainly err in admitting the exhibit and there is sufficient evidence to support the jury verdict, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-26\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-27\">Stoker, an African-American male, worked at Stemco for five years in the hubcap and rubber molding departments. On what turned out to be his final day of employment, Stoker refused to clean his machine as instructed by his Team Lead and insisted that he see his supervisor.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After meeting with his Team Lead and supervisor, Stoker returned to the production floor and yelled to his Team Lead: \u201cI want you to go on; I\u2019m tired of you F \u2014 ing with me!\u201d Stemco then terminated Stoker for \u201cinsubordination.\u201d Stoker brought this lawsuit against Stemco, alleging that he was terminated because of his race in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-28\">At trial, Stoker, who was represented by counsel, testified that he was called a \u201clazy n \u2014 \u201d and \u201cboy\u201d by one of the supervisors involved in the decision to terminate Stoker. Stoker also testified that he was recognized as a \u201ctop producer\u201d and received awards and recognitions, including a Chick-Fil-A card.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-29\">Stemco produced eight witnesses, including Johnny King, a 40-year Stemco employee and African-American. King was involved in Stoker\u2019s discipline for five to six years. King testified that Stoker was a troublesome employee with an \u201cexcessive\u201d disciplinary history and a problem <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>with authority. King also testified that Stoker\u2019s supervisors were fair and did not treat Stoker differently because of his race.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">Stemco also produced documentation of at least nine different occasions where Stoker was formally disciplined by seven separate supervisors and three Human Resources representatives, including three African-Americans. He was reprimanded for making over 500 sub-standard parts, refusing to follow supervisor instructions, verbally abusing co-workers and supervisors, and threatening and intimidating a supervisor. Witnesses also testified that Stoker was suspended for three days for violating Stemco\u2019s safety policies and a supervisor\u2019s instructions after refusing to leave a building during a fire alarm. On a separate occasion, Stoker refused to reenter his workplace after a fire alarm at 2:35 a.m. because he did not personally hear from a specific Human Resources manager who was home sleeping at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">The jury returned a verdict in favor of Stemco, and the district court entered final judgment. Stoker later filed multiple post-judgment motions, which the district court denied. Stoker, acting pro se, filed a timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">Stoker makes two arguments on appeal: the district court plainly erred by admitting a demonstrative exhibit during opening statements in violation of Federal Rule of Evidence 1006 and that there was insufficient evidence to support the verdict. The parties agree that both issues are reviewed under plain error because Stoker did not object to the demonstrative exhibit at trial or file a Rule 50(a) motion at the close of the evidence. <em>See Boh Bros., </em>731 F.3d at 452; <em>United States ex rel. Wallace v. Flintco, Inc., </em>143 F.3d 955, 963-64 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-11\">Under plain error review, Stoker must show: (1) an error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affected his substantial rights. <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). After this showing, we have discretion to remedy the error (4) \u201conly if the error seriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Escalante-Reyes, </em>689 F.3d 415, 419 (5th Cir.2012) (en banc). Under plain error review, \u201c[i]f <em>any </em>evidence supports the jury verdict, the verdict will be upheld.\u201d <em>Flintco, Inc., </em>143 F.3d at 964 (citing <em>Polanco v. City of Austin, </em>78 F.3d 968, 974 (5th Cir.1996)). Also, the \u201cjury is free is choose between reasonable constructions of the evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Ramos-Cardenas, </em>524 F.3d 600, 605 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-12\">Turning to Stoker\u2019s first argument, Stemco\u2019s use of a demonstrative exhibit during opening statement was not plain error requiring reversal. Initially, we observe that, contrary to Stoker\u2019s argument, Federal Rule of Evidence 1006 does not apply because Rule 1006 does not bar a demonstrative exhibit where the underlying documents are admitted into evidence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 1006. Stemco created a chart summarizing nine previous disciplinary actions against Stoker and submitted it to Stoker\u2019s counsel before trial. In a pretrial hearing, the district court instructed the parties that Stemco\u2019s chart was a demonstrative exhibit \u2014 merely a \u201cjury aid\u201d and not evidence \u2014 and that any objections must be taken up before presentation to the jury. Stoker did not object to the demonstrative exhibit. Before allowing the jury to view the demonstrative exhibit, the district court explained that the chart was not evidence, would not be allowed in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>the jury room, and merely summarized documents that would be later admitted as evidence. The district court has wide latitude to allow counsel to use a demonstrative exhibit that was later supported by evidence and not objected to and when the district court properly gave a limiting instruction. There was no error, plain or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">Turning to Stoker\u2019s second argument, there is more than sufficient evidence to support the verdict. <em>See Flintco, Inc., </em>143 F.3d at 964 (\u201c[i]f <em>any </em>evidence supports the jury verdict, the verdict will be upheld.\u201d). While Stoker testified that he had been terminated as a result of racial discrimination, the jury was free to choose to believe Stemco\u2019s extensive evidence that Stoker was terminated for insubordination. <em>See Ramos-Cardenas, </em>524 F.3d at 605 (\u201cthe jury is free is choose between reasonable constructions of the evidence.\u201d). AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b350-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
