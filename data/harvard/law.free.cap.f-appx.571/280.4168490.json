He requested relief in the form of cancellation of removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b). The immigration judge (IJ) found that Rojo was not eligible for cancellation of removal because he had not established the requisite 10 years of continuous physical presence, <em>see </em>\u00a7 1229b(b)(l)(A), and he had not established that his qualifying relatives would suffer the requisite level of hardship upon his removal, <em>see </em>\u00a7 1229b(b)(l)(D). Thus, the IJ denied Rojo\u2019s application for cancellation of removal but granted him voluntary departure under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229c. On appeal, the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) conducted a de novo review and agreed that Rojo had not established the requisite level of hardship for purposes of \u00a7 1229b(b)(l)(D). Because the BIA concluded that Rojo was ineligible for cancellation of removal by virtue of that deficiency, the BIA did not reach the issue whether he had established the 10 years of continuous physical presence required by \u00a7 1229b(b)(l)(A), and it dismissed Rojo\u2019s appeal. Rojo now petitions for review of the BIA\u2019s order dismissing his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-21\">Rojo first challenges the BIA\u2019s hardship determination. We lack jurisdiction over Rojo\u2019s challenge to the BIA\u2019s factual determination that he did not establish the level of hardship required by \u00a7 1229b(b)(1)(D). <em>See Sattani v. Holder, </em>749 F.3d 368, 2014 WL 1420288, at *3 (5th Cir.2014); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i), (a)(2)(D). Rojo\u2019s argument that the BIA applied an improper legal standard by considering the hardship currently being suffered by Rojo\u2019s children without considering the future hardship they would suffer could have been raised before the BIA in a motion for reconsideration. <em>See Omari v. Holder, </em>562 F.3d 314, 320 (5th Cir.2009). Because Rojo\u2019s legal claim was not raised before the BIA, it is unexhausted, and we lack jurisdiction to consider it. <em>See id. </em>at 318-20; \u00a7 1252(d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-22\">Rojo next challenges the IJ\u2019s determination that he had not established 10 years of continuous physical presence for purposes of \u00a7 1229b(b)(l)(A). That determination is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>a nondiscretionary decision that we do have jurisdiction to consider. <em>See Mireles-Valdez v. Ashcroft, </em>349 F.3d 213, 217 (5th Cir.2003). However, a court should generally remand a case to the BIA for consideration of an issue the BIA did not reach in the first instance. <em>See, e.g., INS v. Orlando Ventura, </em>537 U.S. 12, 16-17, 123 S.Ct. 353, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002). A remand is unnecessary here, though. As the decision that Rojo is not eligible for cancellation of removal on hardship grounds would not be altered even if we were to rule favorably on his challenge to the determination on his continuous physical presence, we need not address Rojo\u2019s argument that the IJ held him to too high an evidentiary burden on this issue. <em>See Capital Concepts Properties 85-1 v. Mutual First, Inc., </em>35 F.3d 170, 176 (5th Cir. 1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">Accordingly, Rojo\u2019s petition for review is DISMISSED to the extent that it contains claims and arguments over which we lack jurisdiction. In all other respects, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b304-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
