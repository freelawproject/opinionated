She asserts that the BIA abused its discretion in agreeing with the IJ\u2019s hardship determination regarding the effect that her removal would have on her children who are United States citizens.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">We generally review only the BIA\u2019s decision except to the extent that the IJ\u2019s decision influences the BIA. <em>Zhu v. Gonzales, 49</em>3 F.3d 588, 593 (5th Cir.2007). With respect to the determination that Gomez-Valdez failed to demonstrate that her children would suffer an \u201cexceptional and extremely unusual hardship\u201d as required under \u00a7 1229b(b)(l), Gomez-Valdez does not raise any constitutional issues or purely legal questions,- and her argument amounts to little more than a disagreement with the weighing and consideration of the relevant factors by the IJ and the BIA; therefore, we lack jurisdiction to review this purely discretionary decision. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i); <em>Sung v. Keisler, </em>505 F.3d 372, 377 (5th Cir.2007); <em>Bravo v. Ashcroft, </em>341 F.3d 590, 593 (5th Cir.2003). Accordingly, we DISMISS Valdez-Gomez\u2019s petition for review for WANT OF JURISDICTION.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"Aof\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
