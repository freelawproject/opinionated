In accordance with his plea agreement, the remaining six counts against him were dismissed, including one count of hostage taking and one count of conspiracy to hostage take.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-22\">Garza challenges the district court\u2019s assessment of the enhancements under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.1(b)(5)(B) and (b)(8)(A). He argues that those enhancements were applied unconstitutionally under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and its progeny because the enhancements increased his statutory maximum sentence and were based on facts that were not admitted by him or found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-23\">As part of his plea agreement, Garza agreed to waive his \u201cright to appeal the conviction, the sentence imposed, or the manner in which the sentence was determined.\u201d The Government contends that Garza\u2019s argument is barred by his appeal waiver. Garza argues that the appeal waiver is invalid because the Government breached the plea agreement and thereby rendered his appeal waiver involuntary and unknowing. Specifically, Garza as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>serts that the enhancements under \u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(5)(B) and (b)(8)(A) and his charges concerning hostage taking were based on the same conduct and that the Government\u2019s presentation of evidence to prove such conduct in support of the enhancements violated its obligation under the plea agreement to dismiss the hostage taking charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">\u201cTo determine whether an appeal of a sentence is barred by an appeal waiver provision in a plea agreement, we conduct a two-step inquiry: (1) whether the waiver was knowing and voluntary and (2) whether the waiver applies to the circumstances at hand, based on the plain language of the agreement.\u201d <em>United States v. Bond, </em>414 F.3d 542, 544 (5th Cir.2005). Garza\u2019s challenge to the appeal waiver is contradicted by the plain language of his plea agreement as well as his statements at rear-raignment indicating that he understood and accepted the terms of his plea agreement, including the appeal waiver. The appeal waiver is valid and bars his challenge to the enhancements under \u00a7 2L1.1(b)(5)(B) and (b)(8)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b326-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
