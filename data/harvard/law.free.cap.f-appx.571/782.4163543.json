We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-18\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b806-19\">Garcon is currently serving a 120-month sentence of imprisonment for possession of a firearm by a felon. His status as a felon resulted from state armed-robbery convictions. On direct appeal, we affirmed his federal conviction and sentence. <em>United States v. Garcon, </em>349 Fed.Appx. 377 (11th Cir.2009) (per curiam). He later filed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion, which was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-20\">In his petition for a writ of error coram nobis, Garcon challenges the state convictions underlying his federal conviction. In a report and recommendation, the magistrate judge construed the petition as a \u00a7 2255 motion, because Garcon essentially was attacking his federal conviction. Since this was Garcon\u2019s second \u00a7 2255 motion, the magistrate judge recommended dismissing it as second or successive. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2255(h), 2244(b)(3)(A). The district judge adopted the report and recommendation and denied Garcon\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-21\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b806-22\">On appeal, Garcon raises 28 claims that challenge his underlying state convictions, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>since they were used as a predicate for his federal crime. Because of liberal construction of pro se pleadings, we evaluate whether Garcon is entitled to relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, or coram nobis. <em>See Boxer X v. Harris, </em>437 F.3d 1107, 1110 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">A. <em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 225h Relief</em></p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">Garcon seeks the invalidation of state convictions, relief generally pursued in a \u00a7 2254 habeas petition. To bring a \u00a7 2254 petition, a petitioner must be in state custody. <em>Medberry v. Crosby, </em>351 F.3d 1049, 1060 (11th Cir.2003). Because Garcon is no longer in state custody, he cannot seek relief under \u00a7 2254. <em>See Means v. Alabama, </em>209 F.3d 1241, 1242 (11th Cir.2000) (per curiam) (\u201c[A] petitioner who challenges an expired state sentence that was used to enhance his current federal sentence must bring his suit under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b807-7\">B. <em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 Relief</em></p>\n<p id=\"b807-8\">When a pro se litigant seeks habeas relief through other writs or actions, we construe the request under the appropriate statute. Pursuant to <em>Means, </em>\u00a7 2255 is the correct statute. <em>See id. </em>But we do not construe coram nobis petitions as ha-beas petitions, when that construction would result in the dismissal of the petition as second or successive. <em>See United States v. Garcia, </em>181 F.3d 1274, 1275 (11th Cir.1999) (per curiam). The district judge correctly interpreted Garcon\u2019s challenge to his state convictions as an attack on his federal conviction. Garcon\u2019s petition should not have been construed as a \u00a7 2255 motion, because that construction would mean his petition necessarily would be dismissed as second or successive. For those reasons, Garcon did not seek \u00a7 2255 relief, to which he would not be entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-13\">\n<em>C.Writ of Error Coram Nobis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b807-14\">\u201cA writ of error coram nobis is a remedy available to vacate a conviction when the petitioner has served his sentence and is no longer in custody....\u201d <em>United States v. Peter, </em>310 F.3d 709, 712 (11th Cir.2002) (per curiam). Because Garcon is still in federal custody, he cannot seek coram no-bis relief for his federal conviction. To the extent that Garcon attempts to use this federal coram nobis petition to challenge his state conviction, he is in the wrong forum. We have recognized coram nobis \u201cis not available in federal court as a means of attack on a state criminal judgment.\u201d <em>Theriault v. Mississippi, </em>390 F.2d 657, 657 (5th Cir.1968) (per curiam).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> If Garcon seeks to bring a coram nobis petition to challenge his state conviction, then he must do it in state court.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-15\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b807-16\">Although the district judge construed Garcon\u2019s coram nobis petition as a \u00a7 2255 motion, we conclude Garcon was not entitled to coram nobis relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-17\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b807-9\">.
