Reason\u2019s convictions arise out of a scheme where he acted as the outside person facilitating a tax-fraud scheme in which a federal prisoner, using the identifying information of other prisoners, filed fraudulent tax returns and claimed unwarranted refund checks. Reason raises several issues on appeal, which we address in turn. After review, we affirm Reason\u2019s convictions and sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-9\">I. CONFRONTATION CLAUSE</p>\n<p id=\"b854-10\">Reason first asserts his Sixth Amendment Confrontation Clause rights were violated. At trial, the Government admitted recorded telephone conversations between two of Reason\u2019s alleged co-conspirators, as well as the fraudulent tax returns. Reason contends that, under the Confrontation Clause, the Government was required to make the speakers and authors of the tax returns available for cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-11\">The Confrontation Clause provides, \u201cIn all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right ... to be confronted with the witnesses against him.... \u201d U.S. Const, amend. VI. The Supreme Court has held that, in addition to in-court testimony, the Confrontation Clause applies to a \u201ccore class of \u2018testimonial\u2019 \u201d out-of-court statements. <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 51, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004). A testimonial statement is inadmissible at trial without the witness\u2019s presence unless the witness was unavailable to testify and the defendant had a prior opportunity for cross-examination. <em>Id. </em>at 53-54, 124 S.Ct. 1354.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-12\">In <em>Davis v. Washington, </em>547 U.S. 813, 826-27, 126 S.Ct. 2266, 165 L.Ed.2d 224 (2006), the Supreme Court explained that, when talking to authorities, a statement intended to establish or prove some past fact is testimonial, while a statement describing ongoing events for another purpose is not. The Supreme Court, later explained that a description of ongoing events did not fall within the Confrontation Clause because the primary purpose of the statement was not to create a record for trial. <em>Michigan v. Bryant, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 1143, 1155, 179 L.Ed.2d 93 (2011). Relying on <em>Crawford, </em>but before the Supreme Court decided <em>Bryant, </em>we held the recorded declarations of a co-conspirator during a conversation between a confidential informant and the co-conspirator arranging a sale of cocaine was not testimonial. <em>United States v. Underwood, </em>446 F.3d 1340, 1347 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b854-15\">Reason never objected to the introduction of the recorded conversations or tax filings on Confrontation Clause grounds, so we review for plain error. <em>See United States v. Charles, </em>722 F.3d 1319, 1322 (11th Cir.2013) (reviewing a claim of Confrontation Clause error not raised in the district court for plain error). Howev<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>er, under any standard of review, Reason\u2019s arguments fail. The challenged conversations took place between two co-conspirators in furtherance of the conspiracy. They were plainly not within the \u201ccore class of testimonial\u201d statements contemplated by the Confrontation Clause post-<em>Crawford, </em>as none of the statements were made with any intention of creating a record for trial. <em>See Bryant, </em>131 S.Ct. at 1155. In light of our holding that a similar conversation with a Government informant does not implicate the Confrontation Clause, a conversation between two conspirators, neither of whom is working with the Government, falls even further outside the scope of the Sixth Amendment. <em>See Underwood, </em>446 F.3d at 1347. Similarly, nothing about the fraudulently filed tax returns suggests they were made with any intent that would render them testimonial.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-4\">II. PREJUDICIAL TESTIMONY</p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">Reason next argues the district court erred in allowing a Government witness to imply that Reason and a co-conspirator spoke in \u201ccode words\u201d on recorded conversations. He argues that the testimony was unduly prejudicial and should have been excluded under Federal Rule of Evidence 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-6\">The Federal Rules of Evidence define \u201crelevant evidence\u201d as evidence that \u201chas any tendency to make a fact more or less probable,\u201d provided that \u201cthe fact is of consequence in determining the action.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 401. Generally, relevant evidence is admissible unless otherwise specified. Fed.R.Evid. 402. Relevant evidence \u201cmay\u201d be excluded \u201cif its probative value is substantially outweighed by a danger of one or more of the following: unfair prejudice, confusing the issues, misleading the jury, undue delay, wasting time, or needlessly presenting cumulative evidence.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-8\">Reason never objected to the Government witness\u2019s use of the phrase \u201ccode words\u201d at trial, and the district court did not plainly err in allowing the testimony. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>459 F.3d 1276, 1296 (11th Cir.2006) (reviewing a claim of evidentiary error raised for the first time on appeal for plain error). When generally discussing the recorded phone calls, the Government witness testified that \u201cthey tend to speak in code and talk \u2014 they\u2019ll say, well, we can\u2019t talk about that. We have to be careful about talking about this and that.\u201d That statement referred to conversations among several conspirators, not Reason in particular. Further, the witness\u2019s explanation that by \u201ccode\u201d he meant the speakers were.evasive or indirect on telephone calls that they knew were being recorded was (1) not very prejudicial, as the conclusion was readily apparent from the portions of the phone calls played for the jury; and (2) highly probative of the speaker\u2019s state of mind. Therefore, under Rule 403, the court\u2019s admission of that statement was not plainly erroneous. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-9\">The other instance where the phrase \u201ccode words\u201d was used was when the court, not the Government witness, in response to Reason\u2019s objection that the witness was speculating about Williams\u2019 intent, explained that, where speakers on a recording were being evasive, someone familiar with the conversation could give their impression of what certain \u201ccode words\u201d meant. However, that statement was made in reference to a specific phone call in which Reason was not involved. Any implication about the use of code words therefore (1) is outside the scope of what Reason is arguing on appeal, and (2) carried comparatively little risk of prejudice to Reason. Accordingly, Reason has not demonstrated any plain error by the district court under Rule 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>III. LOSS AMOUNT</p>\n<p id=\"b856-4\">Reason next argues the loss amount attributed to him in calculating a sentence was excessive. He asserts the court\u2019s conclusion was improperly made without reference to Reason\u2019s role in the conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">Where a fraud conviction results in a loss between $2.5 million and $7 million, the Sentencing Guidelines call for an 18-level enhancement. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(1)(J). In the context of discussing a loss-amount calculation, we have held a defendant may be held responsible for the reasonably foreseeable acts of his co-conspirators. <em>United States v. Mateos, </em>623 F.3d 1350, 1370 (11th Cir.2010). The district court is required to make an individualized finding regarding the scope of a particular defendant\u2019s criminal activity. <em>Id. </em>However, where a court determines the scope of a defendant\u2019s involvement includes the \u201cessence of the fraud,\u201d it is not required to establish the defendant\u2019s involvement with each specific method or instance of fraud. <em>Id. </em>at 1370-71. In <em>Mateos, </em>the defendant was aware she was part of a scheme to overbill Medicare. The defendant argued that, while she knew some patients were receiving less medical care than the clinic was billing Medicare for, she did not know the clinic also billed Medicare for patients receiving no medical care at all, and therefore should not be held liable for the loss occasioned from the latter class of patients. The court held it was proper for the court to attribute the entire intended loss to the defendant whether or not she knew Medicare claims were submitted on behalf of patients who received no medical care, as she was aware of the overall goal of the conspiracy \u2014 to overbill Medicare. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b856-7\">Reason cannot show clear error by the district court. <em>See United States v. Medina, </em>485 F.3d 1291, 1297 (11th Cir. 2007) (reviewing loss-amount determination for clear error). After considering Reason\u2019s objections, the court adopted the facts contained in the PSI. Reason did not object to the PSI\u2019s assertion that Reason negotiated the first of the treasury checks. He also did not object to the PSI\u2019s assertions the scheme\u2019s organizer told Reason to have another conspirator add signatures to the check and Reason \u201cagreed to cash additional U.S. Treasury checks.\u201d Those facts were, therefore, admitted for sentencing purposes. <em>See United States v. Bennett, </em>472 F.3d 825, 833-34 (11th Cir. 2006) (stating the failure to object to facts found in a presentence investigation report (PSI) renders those facts admitted for sentencing purposes). Reason\u2019s awareness he negotiated one treasury check in someone else\u2019s name, someone other than the named recipient signed the check, and there would be additional checks was sufficient to show Reason knew the general nature of the conspiracy \u2014 to obtain money from someone else\u2019s tax returns. The court was not required to inquire into Reason\u2019s awareness of each individual tax return, as, once Reason was aware of the general nature of the conspiracy, he could be held accountable for the reasonably foreseeable intended loss of his co-conspirators. <em>See Mateos, </em>623 F.3d at 1370-71; <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1, comment, (n. 3(A)(iv)) (explaining for purposes of the guideline, \u201c \u2018reasonably foreseeable pecuniary harm\u2019 means pecuniary harm that the defendant knew or, under the circumstances, reasonably should have known, was a potential result of the offense\u201d). Therefore, it was not error for the district court to have included the intended return for all nine filings made in its loss calculation, irrespective of whether Reason was aware of each individual filing. Accordingly, it did not clearly err in imposing the 18-level enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>IV. SOPHISTICATED MEANS</p>\n<p id=\"b857-4\">Reason next argues the court erred in imposing a two-level sophisticated means increase under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(10). He asserts there was no evidence that any conspirator sought to relocate the scheme to avoid law enforcement, and there was no evidence the scheme involved otherwise sophisticated means.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">Where a theft-related offense involves sophisticated means, the offense level should be increased by two levels. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(10)(C). The two-level enhancement can also apply where the defendant participated in relocating a fraudulent scheme to another jurisdiction to evade law enforcement or regulatory officials. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(10)(A). The enhancement may apply even where each individual action by a defendant is not sophisticated, so long as the overall scheme was sophisticated. <em>United States v. Barrington, </em>648 F.3d 1178, 1199 (11th Cir.2011). We have upheld the sophisticated-means enhancement where the defendant, in addition to forging documents, had the proceeds of his fraud transferred to unwitting third parties, who then transferred the money to him. <em>United States v. Ghertler, </em>605 F.3d 1256, 1267-68 (11th Cir. 2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b857-6\">The imposition of the sophisticated means enhancement was not clear error. <em>See Barrington, </em>648 F.3d at 1198-99 (reviewing a district court\u2019s finding a defendant used sophisticated means for clear error). The offense involved the filing of fraudulent tax returns with purportedly legitimate documentation using real corporation names and employer identification numbers; the use of written communications, some disguised as legal mail; careful communication to evade discovery by prison officials; and a plan to launder money through a car dealership. <em>See United States v. Madoch, </em>108 F.3d 761, 766 (7th Cir.1997) (holding concealment effort were sophisticated enough to warrant the enhancement when a defendant created false W-2 forms, phony itemized deductions and employment records and filed them under the social security numbers of knowing accomplices and unwitting clients, and had the refund checks mailed to five different addresses). Reason negotiated the refund check, in excess of $200,000, to a car dealership to buy a car worth about $10,000. Once the check cleared, Reason directed the dealership to account for the excess money by writing its own separate checks to seven different conspirators in the scheme. Reason\u2019s tax scheme was more complex and demonstrated greater intricacy or planning than a routine tax-evasion case. <em>See Ghertler, </em>605 F.3d at 1267-68; <em>United States v. Ambort, </em>405 F.3d 1109, 1120 (10th Cir.2005). Accordingly, the district court did not clearly err in imposing a sophisticated means enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-9\">V. OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE</p>\n<p id=\"b857-10\">Reason last argues the court erred in imposing a two-level U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1 enhancement for obstruction of justice. The court imposed the enhancement after concluding that Reason perjured himself when he testified at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-11\">The Sentencing Guidelines provide for a two-level enhancement where a defendant \u201cwillfully obstructed or impeded ... the administration of justice with respect to the investigation, prosecution, or sentencing of the instant offense of conviction\u201d and where the obstructive conduct related to the offense of conviction. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1. Perjury, where the perjury regarded a material matter and was not due to confusion or mistake, warrants the imposition of the enhancement. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3C1.1, comment, (n. 4(B)); <em>see United States v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number><em>Williams, </em>627 F.3d 839, 845 (11th Cir. 2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b858-5\">Here, the district court found that there was \u201cabundant evidence\u201d that Reason perjured himself during the trial. There was evidence in the Government\u2019s case that Reason and a co-conspirator had discussed finding \u201cfake dependents\u201d for Reason so that he would no longer owe the IRS money. In his testimony, Reason testified he never discussed defrauding the Government. That conflicting testimony alone was sufficient to show that the district court did not clearly err in imposing the \u00a7 3C1.1 enhancement based on perjured testimony. <em>See Williams, </em>627 F.3d at 845. Accordingly, the district court did not clearly err in imposing this enhancement. <em>See id. </em>at 844 (reviewing the factual findings underlying an obstruction of justice enhancement for clear error).</p>\n<p id=\"b858-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
