R.Civ.P. 54(d) and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1920.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Reversible error has been shown; we dismiss the appeal in part, affirm in part, vacate in part, and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-7\">Beach-Mathura filed a complaint against American Airlines, alleging that she injured her lower back and pelvic bone when \u2014 due to the negligence of an American Airlines employee \u2014 she fell from a wheelchair at the check-in counter. Because Beach-Mathura suffered various back injuries from four earlier car accidents, an assault and battery, and a workplace incident, much of the discovery and trial testimony centered on whether Beach-Mathura\u2019s alleged injuries existed before-or were, in fact, caused by \u2014 her wheelchair fall. After a four-day trial, the jury returned a verdict in favor of American Airlines; and American Airlines filed a motion to tax costs, pursuant to Fed. R.Civ.P. 54(d)(1) and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1920. The district court granted American Airlines\u2019s motion in part and awarded a total of $7,570.05 for transcript fees, witness fees, photocopying expenses, and service of process fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-9\">On appeal, Beach-Mathura challenges several of the line items included in the district court\u2019s award.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We review a district court\u2019s award of costs to the prevailing party under an abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Mathews v. Crosby, </em>480 F.3d 1265, 1276 (11th Cir.2007). A district court abuses its discretion if it awards costs based on \u201cfindings of fact that are clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b836-10\">\u201cPrevailing parties are entitled to receive costs under Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(d),\u201d but \u201ca court may only tax costs as authorized by statute.\u201d <em>United States E.E.O.C. v. W &amp; O, Inc., </em>213 F.3d 600, 620 (11th Cir. 2000). Costs authorized under section 1920-and, thus, taxable under Rule 54(d)\u2014 include, among other things, these items: \u201c(1) Fees of the ... marshal; (2) Fees for printed or electronically recorded transcripts necessarily obtained for use in the case; ... [and] (4) Fees for exemplification and the costs of making copies of any materials where the copies are necessarily obtained for use in the case.... \u201d <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1920.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-11\">We first address Beach-Mathura\u2019s challenge to the district court\u2019s award of fees for service of process. Fees for private process servers may be taxed under section 1920(1) so long as they do not exceed the fees authorized by section 1921. <em>W &amp; O, Inc., </em>213 F.3d at 624. Before December 2008, service of process fees were taxed at \u201c$45 per hour (or portion thereof) for each item served ... plus travel costs and any other out-of-pocket expenses.\u201d 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 0.114(a)(3) (2008), <em>amended by </em>73 Fed.Reg. 69,552, 69,554 (Nov. 19, 2008). Then, effective December 2008, the taxable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>rate for service of process increased to $55 per hour. <em>See </em>28 C.F.R. \u00a7 0.114(a)(3) (2009), <em>amended by </em>78 Fed.Reg. 59,817, 59,819 (Sept. 30, 2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b837-4\">In support of its motion to tax costs, American Airlines submitted several receipts for service of process fees, some of which were incurred before, and some of which were incurred after, December 2008. Regardless of the date of service, however, the district court applied a $55 per hour rate to all service of process fees. In doing so, the court approved a $55 award for an October 2008 service of process on the records custodian for the Florida Department of Financial Services: an award that should have been capped at $45. Because that portion of the award was based on a clearly erroneous factual finding, the district court abused its discretion in awarding the full amount of service of process costs. The district court taxed Beach-Mathura properly for the remaining service of process fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">Next, we address Beach-Mathura\u2019s challenge to the district court\u2019s award of costs for the deposition transcripts of Dr. Rivera-Kolb, Dr. Cameron, Dr. Osborn, and a records custodian for Open Magnetic Imaging, Inc. (\u201cOMI\u201d). The district court awarded properly costs for the deposition transcripts of Drs. Rivera-Kolb and Cameron, two of Beach-Mathura\u2019s treating physicians, because both doctors (or his predecessor) were listed on Beach-Mathu-ra\u2019s witness list.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See W &amp; O, Inc., </em>213 F.3d at 621 (\u201c[t]axation of deposition costs of witnesses on the losing party\u2019s witness list is reasonable because the listing of those witnesses indicated\u201d that the transcripts might be necessary for-eross-exam-\u00a1nation and that those witnesses had pertinent information about the case).</p>\n<p id=\"b837-12\">Taxation for Dr. Osborn\u2019s deposition transcript was also appropriate because he provided information about Beach-Mathura\u2019s pre-existing injuries \u2014 a central issue at trial \u2014 and portions of his deposition were read into evidence at trial. <em>See id. </em>(\u201cadmission [of deposition testimony] into evidence ... tends to show that it was necessarily obtained.\u201d). The deposition transcript for the OMI records custodian was obtained necessarily because (1) OMI performed the only magnetic resonance imaging (\u201cMRI\u201d) studies on Beach-Mathura\u2019s spine after her admitted preexisting injuries and before the wheelchair incident and (2) Beach-Mathura denied having a copy of that pertinent MRI in her possession. Because the OMI deposition was an attempt to locate a document central to the litigation, we see no abuse of discretion in awarding costs for the transcript.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-13\">Beach-Mathura also challenges the district court\u2019s taxation of costs for photocopying expenses. In determining whether copying costs are taxable pursuant to section 1920(4), \u201cthe court should consider whether the prevailing party could have reasonably believed that it was necessary to copy the papers at issue.\u201d <em>W &amp; O Inc., </em>213 F.3d at 623. \u201c \u2018Copies attributable to discovery\u2019 are ... recoverable under \u00a7 1920(4).\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b837-14\">Beach-Mathura argues that several of the copying expenses \u2014 including her MRIs, workers\u2019 compensation records, insurance records, and pharmacy records\u2014 should have been disallowed because the documents were cumulative of information <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>already available in her medical records. Because these supplemental documents helped establish the extent of Beach-Ma-thura\u2019s pre-existing injuries the district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that the copied documents were appropriate discovery materials and obtained necessarily for use in the case. We also reject Beach-Mathura\u2019s challenge to the photocopying expenses for the trial exhibits and jury exhibit notebooks because trial exhibit expenses are permitted expressly by section 1920(4) and because the court ordered American Airlines to prepare jury exhibit notebooks.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-4\">The district court abused no discretion in refusing to reduce American Airlines\u2019s award based on Beach-Mathura\u2019s alleged inability to pay. A district court may \u2014 but is not required to \u2014 consider a losing party\u2019s financial status in awarding costs. <em>See Chapman v. AI Transp., </em>229 F.3d 1012, 1039 (11th Cir.2000) (en banc). If the district court considers financial status as a factor, it \u201cshould require substantial documentation of a true inability to pay.\u201d <em>Id, </em>The district court acknowledged that it had discretion to reduce American Airlines\u2019s award based on Beach-Mathu-ra\u2019s financial status but declined to do so because Beach-Mathura failed to provide sufficient documentation of her inability to pay. Nothing in the record evidences Beach-Mathura\u2019s inability to pay; we see no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">Because the award of costs for the service of process fees was based on a clearly erroneous fact-finding, we vacate the award of costs with instructions to retax costs in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-6\">APPEAL DISMISSED IN PART.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-7\">AFFIRMED IN PART; VACATED IN PART; and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b836-8\">. In a separate order, we dismissed as untimely the portion of Beach-Mathura\u2019s appeal seeking review of the final judgment and the denial of her motion to overturn the jury verdict and for a new trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b836-12\">. To the extent that Beach-Mathura challenges items not included in the district court\u2019s award (including costs for expedited trial transcripts, witness fees exceeding $40 per day, and copying costs for defense counsel\u2019s trial notebooks), her appeal is dismissed as moot.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b837-6\">. On her witness list, Beach-Mathura listed originally Dr. Zaslow as one of the doctors who treated her after the wheelchair incident; but she later clarified that Dr. Zaslow died before he could treat her and that she, in fact, received medical services at Dr. Zaslow\u2019s practice from Dr. Cameron.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
