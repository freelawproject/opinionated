In 2006, Huntley pled guilty to 1 count of possessing more than 50 grams of crack cocaine and an unspecified quantity of powder cocaine with intent to distribute. He was sentenced to 120 months\u2019 imprisonment, the statutory minimum sentence in place at the time of his sentencing. In 2011, he filed the present \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, arguing that the FSA and its statutory amendments should apply retroactively to reduce his sentence. The district court denied his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, stating that he was ineligible for relief because the FSA did not apply retroactively to change his statutory minimum sentence, so his sentence could not be reduced below 120 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-16\">On appeal, Huntley argues that his mandatory-minimum sentence does not prevent the reduction of his sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) pursuant to Amendment 750, because his \u201csentencing range\u201d was reduced by the amendment, even if his guideline sentence of 120 months was not. He further states that his case is distinguishable from <em>United States v. Hippolyte, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"905\">*905</page-number>712 F.3d 535 (11th Cir.2013), which held that the FSA was not retroactive, because the defendant in that case was sentenced under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.1(b), while he was sentenced under \u00a7 5G1.1(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b929-5\">We review for an abuse of discretion the district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. White, </em>305 F.3d 1264, 1267 (11th Cir.2002). We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>Id. </em>We are bound by the opinion of a prior panel unless the Supreme Court or this Court sitting <em>en banc </em>overrules that opinion. <em>United States v. Lawson, </em>686 F.3d 1317, 1319 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 133 S.Ct. 568, 184 L.Ed.2d 371 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b929-8\">A district court may modify a term of imprisonment in the case of a defendant who was sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). A reduction, however, must be \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The applicable policy statements, found in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, state that \u201c[a] reduction in the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment ... is not authorized under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) if ... [the] amendment ... does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B). More specifically, the commentary provides that a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction is not authorized and not consistent with \u00a7 IB 1.10(a)(2)(B) where \u201cthe amendment does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range because of the operation of another guideline or statutory provision <em>(e.g., </em>a statutory mandatory minimum term of imprisonment).\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1B1.10, comment, (n. 1(A)).</p>\n<p id=\"b929-9\">The FSA, enacted on August 3, 2010, raised the quantity of crack cocaine necessary to trigger the 10-year mandatory-minimum sentence from 50 grams to 280 grams. <em>See </em>Pub.L. No. 111-220, \u00a7 2(a)(1), 124 Stat. 2372 (2010), <em>codified at </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A)(iii). The FSA directed the Sentencing Commission to promulgate emergency amendments to bring the Guidelines into conformity with its provisions \u201cas soon as practicable.\u201d Pub.L. 111-220, \u00a7 8, 124 Stat. at 2374. Amendment 750 to the Sentencing Guidelines amended the drug quantity table in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c) to reduce offense levels in crack cocaine eases by two levels. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 750 (2011). Amendment 750 was made retroactive by Amendment 759, effective November 1, 2011. <em>See id., </em>Amend. 759 (2011); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(c). On June 21, 2012, the Supreme Court held in <em>Dorsey </em>that the FSA\u2019s reduced statutory mandatory minimums apply to defendants who committed crack cocaine offenses before the FSA\u2019s August 3, 2010, effective date, but were sentenced after that date. <em>Dorsey v. United States, </em>567 U.S. -, -, 132 S.Ct. 2321, 2335-36, 183 L.Ed.2d 250 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b929-11\">In <em>Berry, </em>we rejected Berry\u2019s argument that he was eligible for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief under the FSA, determining that the FSA was not a guidelines amendment by the Sentencing Commission, but rather a statutory change by Congress. <em>United States v. Berry, </em>701 F.3d 374, 377 (11th Cir.2012). Thus, it did not serve as a basis for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction in Berry\u2019s case. <em>Id. </em>Even assuming that Berry could bring his FSA claim in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, we continued, his claim still failed because he was convicted and sentenced in 2002 and the FSA did not apply retroactively to his 2002 sentences. <em>Id. </em>We agreed with \u201cevery other circuit to address the issue\u201d that there was no evidence that Congress intended the FSA to apply to defendants who had been sentenced before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"906\">*906</page-number>the August 3, 2010, date of the FSA\u2019s enactment. <em>Id. </em>Finally, we distinguished the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Dorsey, </em>noting that <em>Dorsey </em>did not suggest that the FSA\u2019s new mandatory minimums should apply to defendants, like Berry, who were originally sentenced before the FSA\u2019s effective date. <em>Id. </em>at 377-78.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-4\">Most recently, in <em>United States v. Hippolyte, </em>712 F.3d 535, 542 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 134 S.Ct. 181, 187 L.Ed.2d 124 (2013), we reaffirmed our conclusion in <em>Berry </em>that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Dorsey </em>did not suggest that the FSA should apply to defendants who were sentenced before the FSA\u2019s effective date. We explained that, because the FSA did not apply retroactively to Hippolyte\u2019s case, the statutory minimums that applied in determining whether he was eligible for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief were the minimums that were in place at the time when he was sentenced in 1996. <em>Id. </em>Finally, we concluded that \u201c\u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not authorize a sentence reduction if a guidelines amendment does not have the effect of reducing the defendant\u2019s sentence.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b930-7\">In this case, the district court properly denied Huntley\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. The FSA\u2019s statutory changes do not apply retroactively to reduce Huntley\u2019s mandatory-minimum sentence. The 10-year mandatory-minimum sentence that was in place at the time of Huntley\u2019s sentencing remains effective, and, therefore, his sentence cannot be reduced below 120 months. Consequently, he is ineligible for relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) based on Amendment 750.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-8\">Upon review of the entire record on appeal, and after consideration of the parties\u2019 appellate briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
