On appeal, Rudolph contends that the district court erred in determining that he qualified as a career offender and as an armed career criminal. He also contends that his sentence, which was derived from the career offender guideline of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, was both procedurally and substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-4\">Upon review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">Rudolph\u2019s objection to the district court\u2019s decision to classify him as a career offender is raised for the first time on appeal. When an objection is raised for the first time on appeal, we review the district court\u2019s determination for plain error. <em>United States v. Beckles, </em>565 F.3d 832, 842 (11th Cir.2009). Under plain error review, the defendant must establish that \u201c(1) there is an error; (2) that is plain or obvious; (3) affecting [his] substantial rights in that it was prejudicial and not harmless; and (4) that seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b778-8\">A defendant is a career offender if (1) the defendant was at least eighteen years old at the time the defendant committed the instant offense of conviction; (2) the instant offense of conviction is a felony that is either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense; and (3) the defendant has at least two prior felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 dBl.Ka).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b778-9\">Rudolph contends that he lacked the requisite number of prior qualifying convictions because one of his two predicate convictions \u2014 his prior conviction for violating Florida Statute \u00a7 893.13 \u2014 does not qualify as a conviction for a controlled substance offense under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. Under Florida law, \u201cit is unlawful for any person to sell, manufacture, or deliver, or possess with intent to sell, manufacture, or deliver, a controlled substance.\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7 893.13(1)(a). A violation of \u00a7 893.13 involving cocaine or cannabis is a felony. <em>Id.; </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 893.03(1)(c), 2(a)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b778-10\">To determine if a prior conviction is a controlled substance offense under \u00a7 4B 1.2(b), we look at the elements of the offense, and not the conduct underlying the conviction. <em>United States v. Lipsey, </em>40 F.3d 1200, 1201 (11th Cir.1994). And looking at the elements of \u00a7 893.13, the district court did not plainly err by determining that Rudolph\u2019s violation of the statue was a controlled substance offense. In fact, the elements of Florida Statute \u00a7 893.13 nearly track the language defining a controlled substance in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(b).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b779-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>ii.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">We review the reasonableness of a sentence under a deferential abuse of discretion standard. <em>United States v. Thompson, </em>702 F.3d 604, 606-07 (11th Cir. 2012), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2826, 186 L.Ed.2d 887 (2013). We review the reasonableness of a sentence using two steps: First, we ensure that the sentence was procedurally reasonable. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). We ensure that the district court considered the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors and adequately explained its chosen sentence. <em>Id. </em>The district court need only have set forth enough information for us to ensure that it considered the parties\u2019 arguments and had a reasoned basis for imposing its chosen sentence. <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 356, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2468, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). Here, the district court determined the Presentence Investigation Report (PSI) was accurate and considered its findings at sentencing. Hearing arguments from both sides, the court sentenced Rudolph after it reviewed the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the advisory sentencing guidelines. The court explained that the sentence met the general goals of punishment and \u201chopefully [would] act as a deterrent to anyone else who might consider similar criminal conduct.\u201d The court\u2019s statement of reasons, though brief, was legally sufficient. <em>Rita, </em>551 U.S. at 356, 127 S.Ct. at 2468. The court said enough to satisfy us that it considered the parties\u2019 arguments and had a reasoned basis for exercising its legal decision-making authority. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b779-8\">Once we have determined that the sentence was procedurally reasonable, we next examine whether the sentence was substantively reasonable in light of the totality of the circumstances. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597. Although we do not automatically presume a sentence falling within the guideline range to be reasonable, we would expect a sentence within the guideline range to be reasonable. <em>See Rita, </em>551 U.S. at 347, 127 S.Ct. at 2463. Furthermore, Rudolph\u2019s 290-month sentence was within his advisory guideline range of 262 to 327 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-11\">Rudolph\u2019s sentence was substantively reasonable. Given his history of recidivism, even after significant terms of incarceration, and his criminal history, which includes a conviction of second degree murder, Rudolph\u2019s sentence was not outside the range of reasonable sentences. Accordingly, the court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b778-7\">. A \"controlled substance offense\u201d is \"an offense under federal or state law, punishable by imprisonment of a term exceeding one year, that prohibits the manufacture, import, export, distribution, or dispensing of a controlled substance (or a counterfeit substance) or the possession of a controlled substance (or a counterfeit substance) with intent to manufacture, import, export, distribute, or dispense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b778-12\">. We do not address Rudolph's contention that the district court erred by classifying him as an armed career criminal since the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>court imposed its sentence based on Rudolph\u2019s status as a career offender.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
