On appeal, Jaimez argues that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress because his consent to search his home was not knowing and voluntary.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-17\">I. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b960-18\">With respect to a denial of a motion to suppress, we ordinarily review the district court\u2019s fact findings for clear error and its application of the law to the facts <em>de novo. United States v. Martinelli, </em>454 F.3d 1300, 1306 (11th Cir.2006). The vol-untariness of a defendant\u2019s consent to a search is a factual determination we will not reverse unless it is clearly erroneous. <em>United States v. Ramirez-Chilel, </em>289 F.3d 744, 752 (11th Cir.2002). Here, however, because Jaimez argues for the first time on appeal that his consent was invalid because it was obtained through trickery and deceit, we review that issue only for plain error.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See United States v. Young, </em>350 F.3d 1302, 1305 (11th Cir.2003). To satisfy plain error review, a defendant must show (1) error, (2) that was plain, (3) that affected his substantial rights, and (4) that seriously affected the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial proceedings. <em>United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217, 1220 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b961-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"937\">*937</page-number>II. VOLUNTARINESS OF CONSENT TO A SEARCH</p>\n<p id=\"b961-5\">Consent to conduct a search is voluntary if it is the product of an \u201cessentially free and unconstrained choice.\u201d <em>United States v. Purcell, </em>236 F.3d 1274, 1281 (11th Cir. 2001) (quotation marks omitted). Volun-tariness of consent depends on the totality of the circumstances. <em>Id. </em>In evaluating voluntariness, we consider several indicators, including \u201cthe presence of coercive police procedures, the extent of the defendant\u2019s cooperation with the officer, the defendant\u2019s awareness of his right to refuse consent, the defendant\u2019s education and intelligence, and the defendant\u2019s belief that no incriminating evidence will be found.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b961-6\">We have found that consent \u201cinduced by deceit, trickery, or misrepresentation\u201d can render consent involuntary. <em>See United States v. Tweel, </em>550 F.2d 297, 299 (5th Cir.1977) (concluding that an Internal Revenue Service revenue agent was deliberately deceptive when he failed to reveal that he was conducting an audit at the request of criminal investigators, which vitiated the defendant\u2019s consent to the agent microfilming documents);<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>cf. United States v. Farley, </em>607 F.3d 1294, 1307-08, 1331-32 (11th Cir.2010) (concluding that agent\u2019s initial claim that he was conducting a terrorism investigation did not render defendant\u2019s consent to the search of his laptop involuntary because the defendant consented to the search only after a ninety-minute interview, during which the defendant became aware that the true subject of the investigation was child pornography).</p>\n<p id=\"b961-7\">III. JAIMEZ\u2019S CONSENT</p>\n<p id=\"b961-8\">Jaimez has not shown that the district court erred, much less plainly erred, in finding that Jaimez\u2019s consent was voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-11\">As the district court found, the agents\u2019 testimony at the suppression hearing established that Jaimez consented to the search of his home under non-threatening circumstances. At the time, Jaimez had agreed to talk with the officers inside his home, and the officers were sitting with Jaimez at his dining table and were dressed in civilian clothes, with their weapons concealed. The officers did not touch Jaimez or his family, did not handcuff Jai-mez, and did not speak harshly, yell, or make threats or promises.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-12\">The officers recorded their conversation with Jaimez. According to a transcript of the recording, Sheriffs Deputy Ashley Pope asked Jaimez whether he had any weapons or drugs in his home. Jaimez said that he had a gun in a safe in his bedroom. Deputy Pope then asked, \u201cDo you mind if we \u2014 we\u2019ve got information there may be some illegal stuff in the house. Do you mind if we search? You have any problems searching?\u201d Jaimez responded, \u201cNo problem.\u201d Deputy Pope further explained, \u201c[W]hat we\u2019d like to do is ... a search, make sure nothing\u2019s here, okay? And then ... we\u2019ll sit down and talk to you, kind of tell you why \u2014 why we\u2019re here. Does that sound like a plan?\u201d Jaimez responded, \u201cOkay.\u201d At the eviden-tiary hearing, Deputy Pope agreed that he did not seek consent to search for anything other than weapons or drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-13\">Further, Jaimez not only provided his verbal consent to the officers, he signed a consent form after it was explained to him in Spanish. That form advised Jaimez of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"938\">*938</page-number>his right to refuse consent and \u201cthat any items found as a result of [his] consent to this search without a search warrant can and may be used as evidence against [him] in a court of law.\u201d The officer, who explained the consent form to Jaimez, testified that he never saw any sign that Jai-mez did not understand what the officer said to him and never heard Jaimez or anyone else ask that the search stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-4\">We recognize that, on appeal, Jai-mez contends that law enforcement officers used trickery and deceit by requesting his consent to search his home for certain items (drugs and weapons), but then seizing other items (such as currency and personal papers). Essentially, Jaimez argues that because his understanding of what the officers were looking for was different than what the officers actually found, his oral and written consent was not knowing and voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-5\">We reject this claim because the record shows that the officers\u2019 actions and statements were not deceptive and did not amount to trickery. Rather, the officers were at Jaimez\u2019s house to arrest him pursuant to a federal arrest warrant for his role in a drug trafficking conspiracy, and the officers accurately informed Jaimez what they were looking for. As Deputy Pope testified, the officers only searched places in the home where they could have found drugs and weapons, and, while searching such places, they found and seized any items that were not drugs or weapons, but that were indicative of drug trafficking, such as notepads that appeared to be drug ledgers, plastic bags, and the $50,000 in U.S. currency found in Jaimez\u2019s bedroom closet.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In light of the consent form Jaimez signed after it was explained to him, it would have been unreasonable for Jaimez to believe that the officers\u2019 statements \u2014 that they were looking for drugs and weapons \u2014 meant, if the officers discovered any other items related to drug trafficking, they would simply look the other way and not seize those items.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-8\">In sum, the district court did not err, much less plainly err, in concluding that, under the totality of the circumstances, Jaimez\u2019s consent to the search was knowing and voluntary. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Jaimez\u2019s motion to suppress the evidence found during the search.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b960-12\">. Although Jaimez entered a guilty plea, he reserved his right to appeal the denial of his motion to suppress.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b960-13\">. Before the district court, Jaimez argued only that his consent was involuntary in light of the number of law enforcement officers present and, even if it was voluntary, the seizure of the currency exceeded the scope of his consent for the officers to search for drugs and weapons.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b961-9\">. In <em>Bonner v. City of Prichard, </em>661 F,2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir.1981) (en banc), we adopted as binding precedent all decisions of the former Fifth Circuit handed down before October 1, 1981.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b962-6\">. The officers seized the $50,000 because Jai-mez told the officers that it was not his money, that a woman had brought it to him for safekeeping, and that he had agreed to package the money and store it until she returned. Based on Deputy Pope\u2019s experience, Jaimez's description of how he obtained the money, the amount of money, and how the money was packaged, Deputy Pope believed the money was related to the drug trade as payment for drug shipments to the United States and was going to be shipped across the Mexican border.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
