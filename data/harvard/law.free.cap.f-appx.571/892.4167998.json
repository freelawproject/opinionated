The BIA concluded that Mr. Ramirez had knowingly and intelligently waived his right to appeal. On appeal to this Court, Mr. Ramirez argues that the BIA erred in dismissing his appeal because it was based on changed circumstances. In addition, he argues that his waiver of his right to appeal was not knowing and intelligent because he was confused and nervous, and his counsel had misled him about the ease with which he could obtain a visa to return to the United States following a voluntary departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-5\">Because the validity of a waiver of the right to appeal is a question of law, we review the BIA\u2019s ultimate decision <em>de novo. See D-Muhumed v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>388 F.3d 814, 817 (11th Cir.2004). <em>See also United States v. Bushert, </em>997 F.2d 1343, 1352 (11th Cir.1993) (addressing a sentence-appeal waiver in a direct criminal case). Factual findings are reviewed for substantial evidence, and \u201cthe administrative findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B). <em>See also Ali v. Mukasey, </em>525 F.3d 171, 173 (2d Cir.2008) (\u201cWe review the BIA\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b917-6\">The BIA did not err in dismissing Mr. Ramirez\u2019s appeal. By agreeing to precon-clusion voluntary departure, Mr. Ramirez waived his right to appeal. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1240.26(b)(l)(i)(D) (\u201cAn alien may be granted voluntary departure by an immigration judge pursuant to section 240B(a) of the Act only if the alien ... [wjaives appeal of all issues.... \u201d). An alien may waive the right to appeal provided that the alien\u2019s decision is knowing and intelligent. <em>See United States v. Mendoza-Lopez, </em>481 U.S. 828, 840, 107 S.Ct. 2148, 95 L.Ed.2d 772 (1987) (holding invalid a waiver that was \u201cnot considered or intelligent\u201d). <em>See also Partible v. I.N.S., </em>600 F.2d 1094, 1096 (5th Cir.1979) (holding that the petitioner had not validly waived her right to counsel because the waiver was not \u201ccompetently and understandingly made\u201d); <em>In re Rodriguez-Diaz, </em>22 I. &amp; N. Dec. 1320, 1322 (B.I.A.2000) (\u201cBy waiving appeal, an alien relinquishes the opportunity to obtain review of the Immigration Judge\u2019s ruling. Thus, it is important that any waiver be knowingly and intelligently made.\u201d). Although we have not addressed waiver of appeal rights in the immigration context in a published decision, it appears that such waivers also must be voluntary. <em>See Cobourne v. I.N.S., </em>779 F.2d 1564, 1566 (11th Cir.1986) (holding that the BIA properly found that petitioner had voluntarily and knowingly waived his right to counsel).</p>\n<p id=\"b917-9\">Nothing in the record supports the argument that Mr. Ramirez\u2019s waiver of his right to appeal was not knowing, intelligent, or voluntary. The record shows that the IJ twice explained that, by accepting preconclusion voluntary departure, Mr. Ramirez was waiving his right to appeal, and Mr. Ramirez indicated his understanding and agreement to such waiver after having an opportunity to consult with his attorney. <em>See </em>R. 118-19, 121. <em>See also Bushert, </em>997 F.2d at 1351 (holding, in the criminal context, that \u201ca waiver is not knowingly or voluntarily made if the district court fails to specifically question the defendant concerning the waiver ... and the record indicates that the defendant did not otherwise understand the full significance of the waiver\u201d) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Accordingly, the record does not support Mr. Ramirez\u2019s argument that his waiver of the right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"894\">*894</page-number>appeal was not knowing and intelligent because \u201che was so confused and nerv[ous]Petitioner\u2019s Br. at 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-4\">We do not have jurisdiction to consider Mr. Ramirez\u2019s claim that his counsel gave him incorrect advice because he did not raise this claim before the BIA, and therefore, it is unexhausted. <em>Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1250 (11th Cir.2006) (\u201cWe lack jurisdiction to consider a claim raised in a petition for review unless the petitioner has exhausted his administrative remedies with respect thereto.\u201d); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1) (\u201cA court may review a final order of removal only if ... the alien has exhausted all administrative remedies available to the alien as of right... ,\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b918-5\">Accordingly, we deny Mr. Ramirez\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-6\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"AD6\">. As noted by the BIA, to the extent Mr. Ramirez wishes to challenge his removal based on changed circumstances, he must file a motion to reopen his removal proceedings before the Immigration Court. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.23(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
