The debt was to be paid in installments and the mortgage contained the following stipulations: \u201c But if default shall be made in the payment of said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>debt, interest charges, or payments, or any of them, according to the terms of said note, or if Mortgagee shall deem itself or said debt insecure, or if Mortgagor shall offer for sale, sell, assign, or dispose of any of said personal property, or if Mortgagor violate any of the covenants or conditions herein contained, then and from thenceforth the entire amount, at the option of the Mortgagee, shall become due and payable at once, and the Mortgagee, its agents, successors and assigns, are hereby authorized in such event to sell all or any part of said personal property with or without notice for cash at private sale or public auction for the best price it can reasonably obtain.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">These terms of the mortgage were left wholly unmentioned in a statement which the defendant delivered to the plaintiff in attempted compliance with the foregoing directions of section 353. Plaintiff\u2019s contention is that this omission \u2014 though everything else stood in order \u2014 was an illegal departure from the statutory command that the statement of the loan should clearly and distinctly show the date of maturity. Theye is authority for that view. In <em>Atta </em>v. <em>Bergin </em>(120 Conn. 152) the court said in respect of a like statute that \u201c the reason for the requirement of the statement is to inform the borrower and, through him, his co-makers of the time or times when he and they may be called upon to pay the note in whole or in part, and this includes information not only of the time of its maturity in regular course but also of the occurrences which would make it payable at an earlier date. \u201d (p. 155.) We hold a quite different opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">Obviously no advance statement of a \u201c <em>date \u201d </em>of maturity of a loan could be made with reference to the operation of contingent privileges conferred on the lender by acceleration clauses in a mortgage. Consequently we are not persuaded that plaintiff\u2019s amplification of the phrase \u201c date of its maturity \u201d is one the words will bear.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">On that construction, moreover, it would be necessary to print upon the statement of the loan a great part of the text of a mortgage whenever (as in this instance) the lender stipulates for the right to be paid in full or to foreclose in the event of breach by the mortgagor of any covenant or condition of the instrument. So unwieldy a recital, it seems to us, would inevi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>tably tend to defeat the straight mandate of section 353 for a clear and distinct statement of the primary items of a small loan transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">Then, too, a failure to obey section 353 not only deprives the lender of all right to collect or receive any principal, interest or charges whatsoever, but makes the lender guilty of a misdemeanor as well. (\u00a7 358.) A provision which imposes such a forfeiture should be strictly construed and should not be held to include any alleged violation which is not clearly within the plain intention of the statute. <em>(National Bank of Auburn </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>75 N. Y. 516, 521.) Furthermore, when conduct is thus to be visited with loss or impairment of liberty or property, clear and exact definition of the offense is called for. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Wallace &amp; Co., </em>282 N. Y. 417.) We believe we would do violence to these principles were we to go along with the plaintiff in his reading of section 353 against this defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">A motion by the defendant for dismissal of the complaint was denied below. The case is here on the following question certified: \u201c Does the complaint herein state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action? \u201d The sole wrong alleged is the silence of the loan statement respecting the acceleration clauses of the mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">The orders should be reversed and the complaint dismissed, with costs in all courts. The question certified should be answered in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">Lehman, Oh. J., Rippey, Lewis, Conway, Desmond and Thacheb, JJ., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">Orders reversed, etc,</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
