If a member\u2019s right to select an option was meant to continue to such time as she was actually retired by resolution of the Board, there would have been no necessity to adopt language limiting that right to thirty days. The Board meets but once a month and therefore in most cases action cannot be taken until more than thirty days after the medical examination. If the Legislature had intended to grant the member thirty days, or until the adoption of a retirement resolution, it would have been simple to use specific and appropriate language to accomplish that end. But the language of the statute is clear and unambiguous and does not so provide. <em>(Matter of O\u2019Brien </em>v. <em>New York State Teachers\u2019 Retirement Board, </em>215 App. Div. 220, 244 N.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AAz\">The rights and obligations of members of the Teachers\u2019 Retirement Association of the City of New York are defined in Title B of Chapter 20 of the Administrative Code of the City of New York (L. 1937, ch. 929), and the Retirement System must be administered in accordance with the provisions of that title. \u201c All teachers \u201d are \u201c members \u201d of the Teachers\u2019 Retirement Association and as \u201c members \u201d of the association are \u201ccontributors\u201d; a \u201cbeneficiary\u201d means a \u201c person in receipt of a pension, an annuity, a retirement allowance, or other benefit \u201d. (\u00a7 B20-1.0.) Upon retirement a \u201c contributor \u201d is entitled to the retirement allowances described in sections B20-44.0 and B20-45.0. These \u201c retirement allowances \u201d include a \u201c pension \u201d and in addition \u201c an annuity * * * which shall be the actuarial equivalent of his accumulated deductions \u201d. A \u201c contributor \u201d is not, however, compelled <em>\u2018 \u2018 </em>to receive on retirement his benefits in a retirement allowance payable throughout life \u201d. He may \u201c at any time \u201d file with the Retirement Board \u201c his election to receive on retirement his benefits in a retirement allowance payable throughout life or to receive the actuarial equivalent of his * * * retirement allowance in a * * * lesser retirement allowance, payable throughout life,\u201d with a provision that the balance of such actuarial equivalent be paid upon his death to his estate or shall be paid to a person nominated by him in accordance with one of the four options specified in the statute. (B20-46.0.) Since only a \u201c contributor \u201d has the right to file his election \u201c at any time,\u201d and since a teacher ceases to be a \u201c contributor \u201d and becomes a \u201c beneficiary \u201d after retirement and receipt of retirement benefits, we assume that the right to file an election does not survive after retirement is complete.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">The problem presented upon this appeal is whether Jeannette Levy, a teacher in the public schools of the city of New York and a member of the Teachers\u2019 Retirement Association from 1917 till 1942, who was retired by resolution of the Retirement Board on April 28, 1942, filed her election while she was still a \u201c contributor \u201d and before she became a \u201c beneficiary \u201d as those terms are defined in the statute. On January 26th the Board of Education of the City of New York by formal resolu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>tion requested the Retirement Board to retire her for disability. Section B20-42.0 of the Administrative Code provides: \u201c Retirement; for Disability.\u2014 Upon the application of the head of the department in which a contributor is employed, or upon the application of such contributor or of one acting in his behalf, such board shall retire such contributor for disability, provided the medical board, after a medical examination of such contributor made by the medical board or by a physician or physicians designated by the medical board * * * shall certify to such board that such contributor is physically or mentally incapacitated for the performance of duty and that such contributor ought to be retired, and, provided further, that such contributor has had ten or more years of city-service.\u201d She attempted to file her election more than thirty days after the medical examination required by the statute had been made, but before the Retirement Board had taken any action to retire the contributor. The Retirement Board rejected the election on the ground that it was made after the \u201c effective date \u201d of retirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">The medical examination was made at the teacher\u2019s home . on March 28th by a physician designated by the Medical Board, and after such examination the Medical Board pursuant to the statute, certified to the Retirement Board that the contributor was incapacitated for the performance of duty \u201c and that such contributor ought to be retired.\u201d On April 10th the contributor received the following letter or notice from the Retirement Board:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-7\">\n<img class=\"blockquote\" height=\"44\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,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\" width=\"340\"/>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AAI\">Teachers\u2019 Retirement System of the City of New York</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ARx\">.Notice of Prospective Retirement</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AJF\">Miss Jeannette Levy,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"As2\">785 Park Avenue,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A59\">New York City.

At that time she was still a contributor and under the statute still had a right to file an election. So the letter informed her, and it gave her notice, too, that the election must be filed before \u201c the effective date of [her] retirement.\u201d The Medical Board under the statute has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>power to certify only that the contributor <em>\u201c ought </em>to be retired.\u201d The statute places upon the Retirement Board the function and duty to retire the applicant after the examination is made. The letter gave notice to the contributor that her <em>\u201c </em>retirement from active service * * * will be listed on the calendar for action by the Retirement Board at its meeting on April 28,1942 \u2019 \u2019 and that such <em>\u2018 \u2018 </em>retirement is scheduled to take place as of April 1, 1942.\u201d The date of April 1st had passed, and though the medical examination by a physician designated by the Medical Board had been held four days before that date, it does not appear whether or not the Medical Board had on or before that date certified to the Retirement Board that the contributor <em>\u201c </em>ought to be retired.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">Whether or not the Medical Board had so certified is immaterial. The Retirement Board had not exercised the retiring function vested in it, and concededly both on that date and on April 10th, when the letter was sent, the contributor\u2019s retirement was not yet accomplished. The contributor filed her election to receive the actuarial equivalent of her retirement allowance in accordance with Option I, as provided in section B20-46.0, before the time when, according to the notice, the retirement was listed for action by the Retirement Board. At the appointed time the Retirement Board, it is said, <em>\u201c </em>approved \u201d the teacher\u2019s retirement \u2014 \u201c said retirement <em>to he effective as of April 1,1942 </em>on a maximum retirement allowance without optional modification.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">The statute vests the retiring function in an officer or board when it commands that the officer or board <em>\u201c </em>shall retire \u201d a member of the civil service of the State or of a municipal corporation when conditions specified in the statute are proven. The statute may leave little or no room for discretion in the exercise of the retiring function. Nonetheless, retirement is not complete until the statutory command had been obeyed and the retiring function has been exercised. That rule has been consistently followed in every case where the question has been presented to this court. In <em>Matter of Keily </em>v. <em>Teachers\u2019 Retirement Board </em>(226 App. Div. 99) the Appellate Division of the First Department held that, under the provisions of the Greater New York Charter, section 1092, subdivision L, paragraph 1 (now \u00a7 B20-42.0 of the Administrative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>Code), retirement does not become effective until the Retirement Board exercises the retiring functions \u201d vested in it, and that a teacher might file an election at any time before the. Retirement Board had acted upon the certificate of the Medical Board. The Retirement Board does not now challenge the correctness of that decision under the provisions of the statute as it existed at the time when the teacher in that case filed her election. The Board maintains that while the case was pending in the Appellate Division, the Legislature adopted a new statutory rule that <em>11 </em>in case of disability retirement, the effective date of retirement shall be the date of the medical examination or such other date within thirty days subsequent to the medical examination as shall be mutually agreed upon by the contributor and retirement board.\u201d (L. 1929, ch. 513.) We must now determine the scope and effect of that statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">The Retirement System of the City of New York in substantially its present form was created by the Legislature by chapter 303 of the Laws of 1917. That statute introduced into the Greater New York Charter a new section, 1092, entitled \u201cPublic School Teachers\u2019 Retirement Fund.\u201d The provisions of that section of the charter as thereafter amended were transferred in 1937 to title B of chapter 20 of the Administrative Code. The provisions of subdivision L, paragraph 1, were transferred without change to section B20-42.0 of the Administrative Code entitled \u201c Retirement: for disability.\u201d Subdivision 0 of section 1092 of the Greater New York Charter as amended by chapter 784 of the Laws of 1920, provided that \u201c a contributor may <em>at any time </em>\u201d file with the board of retirement his election to receive on retirement his benefits in a retirement allowance payable throughout life or to receive the actuarial equivalent of the value of his annuity, his pension or his retirement allowance payable throughout his life, with the provision that the balance of such actuarial value be paid to his estate or to a person nominated by him in manner described in options defined by the statute. The statutory provision that the contributor may <em>at any time </em>file his election was transferred without change to section B20-46.0.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">The Charter section as it existed prior to 1929 provided in subdivision N that upon the death of a contributor \u201c <em>before retirement </em>\u201d, death benefits therein described must be paid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>to Ms estate or to a person nominated by him. The same section of the Charter provided in subdivision 0 for benefits <em>on retirement, </em>and the right to file an election \u2018 <em>\u2018 </em>at any time \u2019 \u2019 was, as we have said, part of that subdivision and <em>applied only to the options therein defined. </em>By chapter 513 of the Laws of 1929 the Legislature inserted a new subdivision, N-l, between subdivisions N and 0. The new subdivision created a right which a contributor had not previously enjoyed, whereby \u201c upon the death of a contributor (1) before retirement, or (2) within thirty days after the effective date of his service retirement, or within thirty days after the filing of his application for disability retirement, in lieu of any retirement allowance, or optional benefit, or any death benefit, there shall be paid to his estate or to such person as he shall have nominated * * * \u201d sums of money calculated in manner specified in that subdivision. <em>The same subdivision contains the definition of the effective date of retirement upon which the appellant Retirement Board relies. </em>The provisions of that subdivision, including the definition of the effective date of retirement, have been transferred to section B20-40.0 of the Administrative Code entitled <em>\u201c </em>Special death and retirement benefits.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Az8b\">That definition was, it seems plain, intended to supplement references to the \u2018 \u2018 effective date \u2019 \u2019 of retirement in other parts of the same subdivision of section 1092 of the Charter, and to fix for administrative purposes what otherwise would have been doubtful and would have required judicial construction. If, as the appellant contends, the Legislature intended that this definition should change the time when retirement for disability in accordance with the provision of section B20-42.0 becomes complete, and thus should limit the time for choice of an option in accordance with the provisions of section B20-46.0 to the period within thirty days after the medical examination, it failed to formulate its intention in language which could be easily understood by a contributor. We find it difficult, if not impossible, indeed, to discern in the statute a legislative intent to deprive the Board, by implication, of the retiring functions expressly conferred upon that Board in section B20-42.0, or to limit by implication the time when a contributor may file his election, though the statute which creates the right expressly provides that he may file his election <em>\u201c </em>at any time \u201d. The date of the medical examination is the statutory \u201c effective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>date \u201d of disability, unless the Board agrees to another date within thirty days subsequent to the examination. The medical' examination is, under the statute, made by one or more \u00b0 physicians designated by the Board. The function of these physicians is confined to making the examination. They advise the Medical Board. Their opinion of the mental or physical capacity of the contributor whom they examine may be accepted by the Medical Board or rejected by the Board. The medical examination is solely for the information of the Medical Board and serves no other purpose. Two other steps remain before retirement is accomplished. Even if the medical examination discloses that the contributor is incapacitated for the performance of his duties, the Medical Board must so certify and must certify, too, that the contributor 11 ought to be retired and then the Retirement Board must act upon that certificate. If the Legislature had provided that the effective date of disability retirement shall be the date of the certificate of the Medical Board, there might be some basis for an argument that it intended that retirement should be accomplished by the filing of that certificate, even though the Legislature failed to amend at the same time the statute which provides that <em>the Retirement Board \u201c </em>shall retire \u201d for disability. There can be no reasonable basis for any argument that the Legislature intended that retirement should be accomplished when the medical examination has been made, repealing by implication the requirement of certification thereafter by the Medical Board of action to the Retirement Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">The legislative intention to leave unchanged the manner in which the retirement should be accomplished is clear. Until that time, it is also clear that \u201c the contributor \u201d has not become a \u201c beneficiary.\u201d Administrative efficiency may at times require that after application to retire a teacher for disability has been made by the appropriate authority, and after a medical examination has been made, the teacher should not be permitted to teach; and the Legislature might reasonably provide that when the retirement is thereafter accomplished, the effective date of retirement should, for administrative purposes, be retroactively fixed at the date when the examination was made unless the Retirement Board and the contributor agree upon another date within thirty days subsequent to the date of examination. Even <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>if the language of the statute were open to a construction that in the interval between the statutory effective date of retirement and the actual accomplishment of retirement, a contributor should no longer have any right to file an election, it would be \u2122 patently unreasonable to give such construction to a statute which provides that the effective date of retirement shall be the date of the medical examination or such other date within thirty days subsequent to the medical examination as shall be <em>mutually </em>agreed upon by the contributor and the Retirement Board. Under that construction the Board by refusing to agree to any other date could render almost illusory the right of election of a teacher retired for disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">It is argued, however, that the Retirement' Board has by Regulation F afforded a contributor reasonable time within which to select the effective date of retirement and to file his election. That regulation purports to confer upon the contributor the right to select the date of the medical examination as the date of retirement or any date within thirty days thereafter. Pursuant to the provisions of that regulation the Retirement Board recognizes an election filed by a contributor within thirty days after the medical examination unless the contributor has previously selected an earlier date for retirement. Assuming, arguendo, that the Board might, by regulation, make a general rule to apply in all cases where the Legislature had vested discretion in it (but cf. <em>Matter of O\u2019Brien </em>v. <em>N. Y. State Teachers\u2019 Retirement, </em>215 App. Div. 220, affd. 244 N. Y. 530), it remains true that the Legislature did vest in the Board the <em>power </em>in each case to agree or to refuse to agree to the choice of a date later than the medical examination, and the Legislature could not reasonably have intended to grant such power if the right to file an election is thus made dependent upon the choice of the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">That right of election may be very valuable to a teacher who has been retired for disability. A retirement allowance terminating with death would be of little value to many teachers who are retired for disability, and for that reason the statute gives to a teacher the right to elect to take a smaller retirement allowance with a death benefit which will accrue upon her death. At times that election cannot be made intelligently until the teacher has been informed whether as a result of the examina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>tion it appears that in fact she is incapacitated and will be compelled to retire. A teacher has not received that information authoritatively at the time of the medical examination. The statute does not- even require that the medical examination be made by the Medical Board. It may be made by a physician appointed by the Board and it has no effect (\u00a7 B20-42.0) except as one step toward certification thereafter by the Medical Board th?,t the teacher is incapacitated.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">There can be no possible doubt that at least until then the status of a contributor who is retired for disability either upon her own application or upon the application of the head of the department remains unchanged. There can be no doubt that a teacher is, at the time of the medical examination, a \u201c contributor,\u201d and since the statute gives a contributor the right to file an election <em>\u201c </em>at any time \u201d, by the plain language of the statute, an election, filed thereafter but before retirement is complete, is timely. The Legislature has said that the date of the medical examination may retroactively become the <em>\u201c </em>effective date \u201d of retirement when the retirement is effected, but the Legislature has not said that rights which have accrued in the interval may be made void retroactively. Since the petitioner\u2019s intestate filed her election before the Retirement Board had, in accordance with the mandate of the statute, retired her, she was at that time still a contributor, and the Board was bound to give effect to her election.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">The order should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">Lohghran, Rippey and Desmond, JJ., concur; Lewis and Conway, JJ., dissent; Thacher, J., taking no part.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">Order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
