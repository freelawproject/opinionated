The relator was found guilty under an indictment charging him with the commission of crime \u201c as a third offender.\u201d Thereafter the District Attorney filed an information charging the relator with being a fourth offender when he committed the crimes because of a conviction of escape in addition to the convictions charged in the indictment. On a jury\u2019s verdict that he was the same person mentioned in the record referred to in the information he was sentenced as a fourth offender. The people were bound by the first verdict and estopped from proceeding with the information. Sections 1942 and 1943 of the Penal Law do not apply. Section 1699 of the Penal Law specifically states that the crime of escape is not to be used as a basis for the charge contained in the information. <em>(People ex rel.

Such a direct appeal can be taken where \u2018 \u2018 the only question involved on the appeal is the validity of a statutory provision of the state or of the United States under the constitution of the state or of the United States; and on any such appeal only the constitutional question shall be considered and determined by the court.\u201d (Civ. Prac. Act, \u00a7 588, subd, 4.) On his attempted direct appeal here relator has raised other questions. He argues that sections 1699, 1942 and 1943 of the Penal Law were misconstrued by the court which sentenced him originally with the result, as he contends, that he was sentenced as a fourth offender instead of as a third offender. Serious though those questions may be, they cannot be answered on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>The appeal should be dismissed.
