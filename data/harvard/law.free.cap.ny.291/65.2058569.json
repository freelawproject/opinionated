The County Clerk was the only person who had the jurisdiction to make the determination and the procedure was in all respects regular. (Civil Service Law, \u00a7 22, subd. 1; <em>Sharkey </em>v. <em>Thurston, </em>268 N. Y. 123.) Even though the appointment of the Deputy County Clerk in charge of the Motor Vehicle Bureau were not authorized she was a <em>de facto </em>appointee so far as petitioner was concerned. <em>(Curtin </em>v. <em>Barton, </em>139 N.

The County Clerk acted in good faith, and accorded petitioner a full and impartial hearing. <em>(Plato </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>27 N. Y. 586; <em>Carpenter </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>30 N.

The charges are either unsubstantiated by proof or too trivial to justify removal from office. <em>(Matter of Mercer </em>v. <em>Dowd, </em>288 N. Y. 381; <em>People ex rel.

The proceedings were illegally conducted in that the deputy did not conduct the proceedings in an impartial and judicial manner. The deputy appointed to hear the charges became a witness and attempted to administer the oath to herself. <em>(Michel </em>v. <em>Semer, </em>205 App. Div. 281; <em>Ullmann &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>American Hawaiian S.

Kenyon </em>v. <em>Sutherland, </em>81 N. Y. 1.) The petitioner was deprived of the right to produce evidence of matters in dis-' proof of the charges made against him. The County Clerk and her deputy, Miss Carlson, have attempted to act as both prosecutor, judge, and jury, and have not accorded the petitioner an impartial hearing. Deputy Easling was never legally, appointed to her position. The proceedings were not instituted in good faith.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b95-7\">\n<em>Per Curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"AEz\">In 1941, appellant County Clerk of Chautauqua County preferred charges against relator, who had held for many years a civil service position in the County Clerk\u2019s office, as a Searcher and Supervisor of Motor Vehicles. Pursuant to section 22, paragraph 1, of the Civil Service Law, relator was given \u201c a hearing upon due notice upon stated charges,\u201d before a Deputy County Clerk. The Deputy County Clerk made a report to appellant, recommending that the charges, with a few exceptions, be sustained. The County Clerk thereupon removed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>relator from his position. In this proceeding to review that ouster, the Appellate Division, by a divided court, annulled the County Clerk\u2019s determination \u201c on the law and the facts,\u201d hold hug that the charges were trivial and unsubstantial, that the County Clerk\u2019s determination was unsupported by competent proof sufficient to satisfy a reasonable man, that there was a preponderance of proof against the existence of the facts which had to be proved to support the determination, and that the determination should be set aside <em>\u201c </em>as against the weight of the evidence.\u201d (265 App. Div. 143, 146.)</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">We agree with the Appellate Division that a number of the charges, such as those involving the numbering machine, paper clips, et cetera, are unsubstantial. Others of the charges were not established by competent evidence, these including the charges as to leaving money unguarded in the Dunkirk office, as to alleged failure to make proper arrangements for opening the branch office bank accounts, and the so-called <em>\u201c </em>additional charge \u201d having to do with the incident on the evening of August 14, 1941. Some of the other charges, and the proof adduced to support them, are vague and general.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">We come to the conclusion, however, that other charges are substantial, or might be so considered by a reasonable mind, and that these charges, to some of which we are about to refer, were supported by competent proof of all the necessary facts, and that there was no such preponderance of evidence against the existence of any of those facts as would require the setting aside of the verdict of a jury. (Civ. Prac. Act, \u00a7 1296; <em>Matter of Weber </em>v. <em>Town of Cheektowaga, </em>284 N. Y. 377.) Among the charges which may be so regarded are those which accuse relator of overstaying his alloted vacation time without permission, of numerous mistakes in scheduling appointments for applicants\u2019 tests, of leaving the County Clerk\u2019s office without permission and of staying home from the office without permission, also the charges of insubordination and inefficiency with relation to the handling of mail. We cannot say, as matter of law, that the County Clerk, in treating those matters as substantial and serious, was acting whimsically, arbitrarily, irrationally or in bad faith. Nor can we say that those particular charges are unsupported by \u201c substantial evidence,\u201d which is all that is required by way of proof. (See discussion in Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>missioner Benjamin\u2019s Report to the Governor on Administrative Adjudication, [1942] first, or unnumbered volume, p. 328, <em>et seq.). </em>Indeed, as to the charge of overstaying his vacation, without permission, for three or four days, the fact is undisputed. The County Clerk has the responsibility of managing her office efficiently. She has the power to remove her subordinates, subject only, when the subordinate is, like relator, a war veteran or a volunteer fireman, to the condition that she grant the subordinate a hearing upon due notice upon stated charges and that on such a hearing she sustain the burden of proving, by substantial evidence, misconduct or incompetency in serious particulars (Civil Service Law, \u00a7 22). When her determination comes to be reviewed in the courts under article 78 of the Civil Practice Act, the courts have no right to review the facts generally as to weight of evidence, beyond seeing to it that there is <em>\u201c </em>substantial evidence.\u201d It is laboring the obvious and the oft-repeated to say that the courts may not substitute their judgment for that of the removing officer as to whether or not a subordinate should be removed. <em>(People ex rel. Guiney </em>v. <em>Valentine, </em>274 N. Y. 331; <em>Matter of Murphy </em>v. <em>Valentine, </em>284 N. Y. 524, 526.)</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">As to the statement in the Appellate Division\u2019s order that its annulment of the County Clerk\u2019s determination is \u201c on the law and the facts,\u201d we find nowhere a grant of power to the courts to review such a determination \u201c on the facts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">The order of the Appellate Division should be reversed and the proceeding dismissed, without costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">Lehman, Ch. J., Loughban, Desmond and Thacher, JJ., concur; Lewis and Conway, JJ., dissent; Rippey, J., taking no part.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-8\">Order reversed, etc.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
