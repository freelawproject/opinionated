Goldstein, Attorney-General (Roy Wiedersum </em>and <em>Orrin G. Judd </em>of counsel), for State Industrial Board, respondent.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ABr\">No direction to make an award was contained in the opinion of the Appellate .Division or in the order which reversed the decision of the State Industrial Board and remitted the matter to the said Board. The Board reconsidered the case, with full discretion to grant or deny an award, arrived at new findings of fact and made an award based thereon. <em>(Matter of Heimroth </em>v. <em>Elk Transp. Co., </em>263 App. Div. 917, 288 N. Y. 716.) The final decision of the Industrial Board allowing compensation was based on sufficient evidence and was properly affirmed. <em>(Matter of Whitmyre </em>v. <em>International Business Machines Corp., </em>274 N. Y. 61; <em>Matter of Falk </em>v. <em>Midland Dairy Co., </em>273 N. Y. 616; <em>Matter of Green </em>v. <em>Geiger, </em>280 N.

On appeal by the claimant to the Appellate Division, this decision was reversed <em>\u201c </em>and the matter remitted to the State Industrial Board for further consideration.\u201d (263 App. Div. 221, 223.) The Board thereupon made an award to the claimant which has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>been affirmed. Carrier and employer have now appealed to us from this affirmance, specifying in their notice of appeal their intention to bring up for review the intermediate reversal by the Appellate Division of the original decision of the Board dismissing the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">On its second view of the matter, the Board (without taking new proof except as to the amount of the award) ordered that its first decision be \u201c amended as of course \u201d so as to make an award to the claimant. Apparently the Board took the opinion of the Appellate Division as a declaration that compensation was due to the claimant. This was a misconception. The Appellate Division had no power to dictate a decision for the Board. <em>\u201c </em>The decision of the board shall be final as to all questions of' fact \u201d. (Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law, \u00a7 20. See <em>Matter of McGrinder </em>v. Sullivan, 290 N. Y. 11.)</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">The order of the Appellate Division should be reversed, with costs in this court and in the Appellate Division against the State Industrial Board, and the matter remitted to the Board for a determination of the issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">Lehman, Ch. J., Loughran, Rippey, Lewis, Conway, Desmond and Thacher, JJ., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">Order reversed, etc.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
