(Labor Law, \u00a7 220.)</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">On November 10, 1939, the Comptroller of the City of New York, having followed procedure set forth in section 220 id., filed in his office an order by which he determined that since January 1, 1935, the prevailing rate of wages for wiremen in the city was $9 a day. The plaintiff, a wireman, had been employed in the City Fire Department from January 1, 1935, to December 31, 1937, at a daily wage of $7.78, his total pay for that period having been $6,006.25. Claiming that during that period, according to the Comptroller\u2019s prevailing rate of wage order of November 10, 1939, he should have been paid at the rate of $9 a day, or a total of $6,975., the plaintiff has instituted the present action to recover the difference, viz., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>$968.75. In its answer the defendant City pleads as a separate defense that it was under no obligation to pay the plaintiff a difference in wages for any period prior to January 1, 1938, because \u2014 \u201cplaintiff did not prior to January 1, 1938, file any verified complaint with the Comptroller of the City of New York as required by \u00a7 220 of the Labor Law regarding the rate of wages paid to said plaintiff as a wireman.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">At Special Term \u2014 where the plaintiff moved to strike out the defendant\u2019s answer and for summary judgment, and the defendant by cross motion applied for an order dismissing the complaint \u2014 the court denied defendant\u2019s cross motion and granted plaintiff\u2019s application for an order striking out the answer and allowing judgment for the plaintiff in the sum of $968.75. Upon appeal by the defendant the Appellate Division modified on the law and facts the order of Special Term and the judgment entered thereupon, by reducing the amount of such judgment to $652.50. Upon granting the defendant\u2019s motion for permission to appeal to this court, the Appellate Division certified the question: \u201c Should the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment have been granted? \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">Under statutory procedure an investigation to determine the prevailing rate of wages of a trade or occupation in a given locality, is made by the \u201c fiscal officer \u201d \u2014 in this instance the Comptroller of the City of New York \u2014 either on his own initiative or upon a \u201c verified complaint in writing \u201d filed with the fiscal officer by \u201c any person interested \u201d. In the latter event the fiscal officer \u201c must \u201d cause an investigation to be made. (Labor Law, \u00a7 220, subd. 7.). A \u201c verified complaint \u201d as applied to a complaint against a municipality, is defined as including \u201c a verified demand or verified notice of claim * * * filed with the fiscal officer * * * \u201d <em>{id. </em>\u00a7 220, subd. 5, par. d). The statute provides further (\u00a7 220, subd. 8): \u201c <em>* </em>* * When a final determination has been reached, if the determination is in favor of the complainant and involves or relates to the rate of wages paid on such public work, the complainant or any other person affected may within three months after the service of notice of the filing of said final order institute an action against the person or corporation found violating this act for the recovery of the difference between the sum actually paid and the amount which should have been paid as determined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>by said final order, <em>from and after the date of the filing of said verified complaint </em>or of filing report of investigation made on bis own initiative with the fiscal officer as hereinbefore provided.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">In the present case the Comptroller\u2019s order of November 10, 1939, resulted from a statutory investigation conducted by that officer after five wiremen \u2014 not including the plaintiff \u2014 had duly filed on January 7, 1936, verified complaints relating to the prevailing rate of wages of wiremen. As the investigation thus prompted progressed, other wiremen \u2014 twenty-three in number \u2014 filed verified complaints with the Comptroller and thereby became parties to the proceeding. In due time, after the Comptroller had determined that the prevailing rate of wages for wiremen was $9 per day, the twenty-three wiremen who had filed complaints were paid the difference between $7J8 a\u00fcd $9 per day for the periods of time to which they were entitled as fixed by the effective dates mentioned in their verified complaints. The plaintiff is one of eight wiremen who filed no verified complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">Despite the plaintiff\u2019s failure to file a verified complaint, he has instituted the present action to secure the difference between the prevailing rate of $9 a day, as fixed by the Comptroller\u2019s order, and the per diem wage of $7.78 received by him from January 1, 1935, to December 31, 1937. In connection with the latter date it should be said that the plaintiff has been paid the difference in wages in arrears beginning the following day, January 1, 1938, on which date the city inaugurated the practice of providing in the budget that the compensation of employees such as wiremen be fixed \u201c at the prevailing rate \u201d of wages.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">Although conceding that he was not one of those complainants whose verified complaints initiated the Comptroller\u2019s investigation which in turn brought about the order of November 10, 1939, the plaintiff asserts that he is a \u201c person affected \u201d by such order and accordingly is entitled to recover the differential below the prevailing rate of wages, as determined by the Comptroller\u2019s order, from the date when a verified complaint was filed by someone other than himself. We think the plaintiff\u2019s argument disregards the language of a subsequent provision in section 220, subdivision 8, which allows \u20181 the recovery <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>of the difference between the sum actually paid and the amount which should have been paid as determined by said final order, <em>from and after the date of the filing of said verified complaint * * </em>* (Italics supplied.) We construe the clause in italics as we did when the same statute was under consideration in <em>Matter of Gaston </em>v. <em>Taylor </em>(274 N. Y. 359, 366) \u2014 \u201c \u2022 * * under the statute the fiscal officer\u2019s determination relates only to the enforcement of the city\u2019s obligation from the date of the filing of the verified complaint. Favorable determination may form the basis f\u00f3r a cause of action arising thereafter.\u201d We do not construe the statutory clause <em>\u201c </em>the complainant or any other person affected \u201d as including a person \u25a0 \u2014 such as the present plaintiff \u2014 who filed no verified complaint. (See <em>Matter of Carr </em>v. <em>Kern, </em>279 N. Y. 42, 48.) As to that portion of the statute we have said \u2014 \u2018 <em>\u2018 </em>The meaning of the statute is hardly subject to doubt. An employee who initiates the invegtigation is a person \u2018 affected \u2019 by the investigation who is entitled to notice. So is an employer who must pay the rate determined by the investigation. Other persons in similar employ are not, for though they may, if they choose, claim the benefit of a determination, yet if they receive no notice of the investigation they are not bound by the determination in the same sense as the employee who initiated the investigation. \u2019 \u2019 <em>(Matter of Heaney </em>v. <em>McGoldrick, </em>286 N. Y. 38, 44.) The plaintiff has already received benefit from the Comptroller\u2019s determination of November 10,1939, \u2014 a benefit prospective in character which entitled him as a wireman to be paid $9 per day from the date of the Comptroller\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">We hold that it is the plaintiff\u2019s failure to file a verified complaint which prevents his recovering benefits antecedent to the Comptroller\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">The orders and the judgments should be reversed and the defendant\u2019s motion granted, without costs. The certified question is answered in the affirmative.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b494-7\">Conway, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ayeu\">(dissenting). On November 10, 1939, the Comptroller of the City of New York, pursuant to the provisions of subdivisions 7 and 8 of section 220 of the Labor Law made and filed an order in his department fixing and determining the prevailing rate of wages of wiremen, effective January 1,1935. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>The names of no particular employees were mentioned in said order which reads in part as follows: \u201c Determined, that the sum of $1.12% per hour or $9.00 per day for an eight hour day is and has been since January 1, 1935 the prevailing rate of wage for wiremen holding positions of steady employment in the City of New York.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">At Special Term the plaintiff was granted judgment for the difference between the prevailing rate of wages as fixed by the Comptroller and the sum actually received by him from January 1, 1935 to December 31, 1937. The Appellate Division modified that judgment so as to provide that the plaintiff\u2019s recovery be limited to the period commencing January 7, 1936, and ending December 31,1937. Apparently the Appellate Division decided that the plaintiff was entitled to the benefits accruing from the Comptroller\u2019s order only from the date of the filing of a verified complaint by any one of the wiremen affected, namely January 7,1936.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">Labor Law, section 220, subdivision 8, provides in part: <em>\u201c </em>* * * When a final determination has been reached, if the determination is in favor of the complainant and involves or relates to the rate of wages paid on such public work, the complainant <em>or any other person affected </em>may within three months * * * institute an action * * * for the recovery of the difference between the sum actually paid and the amount which should have been paid as determined by said final order, from and after the date of the filing of said verified complaint or of filing report of investigation made on his own initiative with the fiscal officer as hereinbefore provided.\u201d (Italics supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">The persons \u201c affected \u201d must necessarily be employees in similar employment, who have not filed complaints. To hold otherwise, it seems to us, would render meaningless the phrase <em>\u201c </em>or any other person affected \u201d. Every phrase in the statute must be given a meaning and a purpose if it be possible. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Dethloff, </em>283 N. Y. 309, 315.) The statute gives a right of action against the employer and if that right of action was to be limited to persons who had actually filed a complaint, the words \u201c or any other person affected \u201d would not have been placed there by the Legislature. Labor Law, section 220, subdivision 7, makes this clear. It provides in part: \u2018 \u2018 The fiscal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>officer as herein defined (the Comptroller) may, on his own initiative and must, on a verified complaint in writing <em>of any person interested, </em>cause an investigation to he made to determine the prevailing rate of wages <em>in the same trade or occupation </em>* * *by the <em>workmen, laborers and mechanics employed on such public work </em>* * The verified complaint here was filed by a person interested. After the determination by the Comptroller, the plaintiff here was one of those <em>\u201c </em>affected \u201d. By necessary implication such was the basis of the decision in <em>Matter of Carder Realty Corp. </em>v. <em>Perkins </em>(237 App. Div. 152, affd. 261 N. Y. 634) although it was not the specific point litigated.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">Moreover, it seems to us that we said as much in express language in <em>Matter of Heaney </em>v. <em>McGoldrick </em>(286 N. Y. 38, 44) although the construction of a provision of subdivision 8 other than the one on which plaintiff sued was in issue: \u2018 \u2018 The meaning of the statute is hardly subject to doubt. An employee who initiates the investigation is a person * affected \u2019 by the investigation who is entitled to notice. So is an employer who must pay the rate determined by the investigation. Other persons in similar employ are not, for though they may, if they choose, <em>claim the benefit of a determination, </em>yet if they receive no notice of the investigation they are not bound by the determination in the same sense as the employee who initiated the investigation.\u201d (Italics supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">In that case we construed the first sentence of Labor Law, section 220, subdivision 8, which reads as follows: \u201c Before proceeding under a complaint presented as provided in subdivision seven, or before making any order or determination upon an investigation made upon his own initiative, the fiscal officer shall order a hearing thereon at a time and place to be specified, and shall give notice thereof, together with a copy of such complaint or the purpose thereof, or a statement of the facts disclosed upon such investigation, which notice shall be served personally or by mail on <em>any person or corporation affected </em>thereby * * (Italics supplied.) We held that an employee who initiated the investigation was a \u201c person affected \u201d and was entitled to notice, but that other persons similarly employed were not.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>, The employee who initiates the proceeding is, of course, the complainant and a party. As such he is entitled to notice. The employer is also a person or corporation affected and a party to the proceeding and is likewise entitled to notice. The thought that a <em>party </em>to the proceeding has rights which other persons do not have is further carried out in the fifth sentence of the subdivision, which reads as follows: \u201c Upon the entry of such order affecting either the hours of labor or rate of wages <em>any party to the proceeding </em>aggrieved thereby may review the said proceedings by a writ of certiorari within thirty days from the notice of the filing of the said order in the office of the fiscal officer.\u201d (Italics supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">The next sentence, however, carries a different thought: \u201c When a final determination has been reached, if the determination is in favor of the complainant and involves or relates to the rate of wages paid on such public work, the <em>complainant or any other person affected </em>may within three months after the service of notice of the filing of said final order institute an action against the person or corporation found violating this act for the recovery of the difference between the sum actually paid and the amount which should have been paid as determined by said final order, from and after the date of the filing of said \u25a0 verified complaint or of filing report of investigation made on his own initiative with the fiscal officer as hereinbefore provided.\u201d (Italics supplied.) If the determination is in favor of complainant (a party) he or any other person affected (not a party) may institute an action against the person or corporation found violating the act. The complainant in the last quoted sentence must be the employee, since the suit is to recover a difference in wages. Neither the complainant nor \u201c any other person affected \u201d could be the employer. Therefore the \u201c other person affected \u201d must be another employee. '</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">In the first sentence of subdivision 8 \u201c person or corporation affected thereby\u201d means, as we read the <em>Heaney </em>case, the complainant who initiated the proceeding and the employer. In the sixth sentence the words \u201c complainant or any other person affected \u201d refers only to employees and must therefore refer to other employees than the complainant who initiated the proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>Were the words \u201cperson affected\u201d in the sixth sentence construed in the same manner as in the first sentence, i', e., as limited to parties to the proceeding, an unreasonable result would follow, thus: The sixth sentence provides that a suit maybe brought for the difference between the wages actually paid and the amount which should have, been paid after the date of the filing of a verified complaint or <em>from the date of the filing of a report of an investigation made by the fiscal officer on his own initiative. </em>In the latter instance there would be no complainant and the only <em>parties </em>would be the fiscal officer and the employer. Since neither of them may be the \u201c other person affected \u201d who may sue for wages, unless the \u201c other person affected \u201d is an employee in the trade or occupation for which the prevailing rate has been determined, the latter part of the sixth sentence would be meaningless.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">In <em>McAvoy </em>v. <em>City of New York, </em>(52 App. Div. 485, 490, affd. 166 N. Y. 588) the proper rule of construction was indicated as follows; \u2018 \u2018 The policy of the law is that laborers, mechanics and workmen employed upon public work shall receive the prevailing rate of wages paid in the locality where they are employed. That policy is just as important with respect to men who are employed by a city as it is with reSpect to men who are employed by a contractor on work for the city. In each case the intent is to insure those laborers the same amount of wages which it has been found necessary to pay to secure the services of other men at the same sort of work, and to insure the payment to public laborers of the same wages which other men in the same locality at similar work, are accustomed to receive. <em>The intention of the law is the thing to be sought and that is to be ascertained from the cau/se of the statute, and the policy as indicated by prior statutes, and where that is found no mere form of words should prevent its adoption, unless the form forbids such a </em>construction(Italics supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">A construction of the statute which would prevent a member of a class of employees entitled to payment of a prevailing rate of wages from receiving the same unless he had himself filed a verified complaint would be unreasonable and contrary to the purpose of the statute, which is to fix a prevailing rate of wages for all persons employed in the same trade or occupation in the same locality. (Labor Law, \u00a7 220, subd. 3.)</p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>Any other construction would have the further unreasonable result of requiring the fiscal officer to determine separately the prevailing rate payable to each member of the class.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">We must therefore hold that the plaintiff is one of those affected by the determination and may bring an action to recover the difference between the sum paid to him and the amount which should have been paid to him. He is entitled to recover that difference from the date of the filing of the verified complaint by the complainant in the proceeding instituted for the purpose of fiving the prevailing rate of wages. The \u201c verified complaint \u201d referred to in subdivision 8 is the verified complaint on which the final determination was made, since no other or different verified complaint is mentioned therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">The judgment should be affirmed, with costs and the certified question answered in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">Lehman, Ch.
