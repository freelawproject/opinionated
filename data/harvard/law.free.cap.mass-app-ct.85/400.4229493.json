The issue is whether, in this declaratory judgment action, a Superior Court judge properly granted summary judgment in favor of the insurer upon concluding that the assault and battery exclusion in the policy relieved the insurer from any duty to defend or indemnify the tavern. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number><em>Background. </em>On or about February 22, 2001, several unidentified people attacked and injured Raymond C. LeMons (Raymond), a defendant in this declaratory judgment action, while he was a patron of Luigi\u2019s V, Inc., doing business as Gigi\u2019s Pub (Gigi\u2019s).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Gigi\u2019s was insured through a commercial general liability policy issued by Certain Interested Underwriters at Lloyds, London (Lloyds). The policy featured an assault and battery exclusion, which excluded coverage in the following situation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-5\">\u201ca. Bodily injury or property damage:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-6\">\u201c(1) Expected or intended from the standpoint of any insured; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-7\">\u201c(2) Arising out of an assault or battery, provoked or unprovoked, or out of any act or omission in connection with prevention or suppression of an assault or battery, committed by any Insured or an employee or agent of the insured.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">Raymond C. LeMons and his wife, Kathleen E. LeMons (Kathleen) (collectively, LeMonses), brought suit against Gigi\u2019s on February 23, 2004, to recover for bodily injuries and loss of consortium on a theory of negligent security by Gigi\u2019s. Lloyds initially assumed the defense of Gigi\u2019s under a reservation of rights, but during the course of the litigation, Lloyds disclaimed its duty to defend or indemnify Gigi\u2019s, citing the assault and battery exclusion in the policy. On August 14, 2006, a Superior Court judge approved a settlement between the LeMonses and Gigi\u2019s, in which Gigi\u2019s agreed to judgment in the amount of $1.2 million on the underlying claim, the LeMonses covenanted not to execute the judgment against Gigi\u2019s, and Gigi\u2019s assigned all of its rights against Lloyds to Kathleen as litigation trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-9\">Meanwhile, on June 8, 2006, Lloyds filed this action seeking a judgment declaring that it had no duty to defend or indemnify Gigi\u2019s with respect to the attack on Raymond. The parties filed cross motions for summary judgment. Following a hearing, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>judge granted summary judgment to Lloyds, reasoning that the assault and battery exclusion relieved Lloyds from a duty to defend or indemnify the tavern. On November 10, 2009, the judge denied the LeMonses\u2019 motion for reconsideration, and the LeMonses appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>\u201cInterpretation of an insurance policy is a question of law to be determined by the court.\u201d <em>Golchin </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>466 Mass. 156, 159 (2013). \u201cThe interpretation of an insurance contract is no different from the interpretation of any other contract, and we must construe the words of the policy in their usual and ordinary sense.\u201d <em>Hakim </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Insurers\u2019 Insolvency Fund, </em>424 Mass. 275, 280 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">\u201cIf free from ambiguity, an exclusionary clause, like all other provisions of an insurance contract, must be given its usual and ordinary meaning.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 281. Where \u201cthere is more than one rational interpretation of policy language, \u2018the insured is entitled to the benefit of the one that is more favorable to it.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid., </em>quoting from <em>Trustees of Tufts Univ. </em>v. <em>Commercial Union Ins. Co., </em>415 Mass. 844, 849 (1993). \u201cA term is ambiguous only if it is susceptible of more than one meaning and if reasonably intelligent persons would differ over the proper meaning.\u201d <em>McLaughlin </em>v. <em>Berkshire Life Ins. Co. of America, </em>82 Mass. App. Ct. 351, 355 (2012), quoting from <em>Suffolk Constr. Co. </em>v. <em>Illinois Union Ins. Co., </em>80 Mass. App. Ct. 90, 94 (2011). But \u201can ambiguity is not created simply because a controversy exists between the parties, each favoring an interpretation contrary to the other.\u201d <em>Surabian Realty Co. </em>v. <em>NGM Ins. Co., </em>462 Mass. 715, 718 (2012) (quotation and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">Although we have previously interpreted more than one assault or battery exclusion in an insurance policy, see, e.g., <em>United Natl. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Parish, </em>48 Mass. App. Ct. 67, 68 (1999) <em>(Parish), </em>the interpretation of the particular phrasing of the insurance exclusion at issue here is a matter of first impression in Massachusetts. In particular, the parties dispute the effect of the final phrase of the exclusion: \u201ccommitted by any Insured or an employee or agent of the insured.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> They disagree about which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>of the antecedent phrases this wording restricts. The answer to that question determines whether the insurance coverage encompasses the claims pertaining to the injuries to Raymond.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">Lloyds argues that the \u201ccommitted by\u201d language attaches only to the words \u201cact or omission\u201d that precede it. Lloyds reads the clause as excluding claims \u201carising out of an assault or battery, provoked or unprovoked\u201d \u2014 no matter who committed that assault or battery \u2014 and as excluding an \u201cact or omission\u201d that was \u201ccommitted by any Insured or an employee or agent of the insured.\u201d Lloyds understands the \u201cact or omission\u201d language as excluding negligent security claims, which necessarily pertain to acts or omissions of the insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">The LeMonses read the exclusion differently. They understand the \u201ccommitted by\u201d language as \u201crefer[ring] to, \u2018an assault or battery,\u2019 which appears twice in the exclusion,\u201d and argue \u201cthat the Assault and Battery Exclusion must apply only when an assault or battery is committed by an employee or agent of Gigi\u2019s.\u201d According to this reading, claims arising from assaults or batteries by anyone other than an insured would be covered by the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">We read the disputed exclusion clause to have two distinct parts. The first excludes coverage for injuries \u201c[a]rising out of an assault or battery, provoked or unprovoked.\u201d The second excludes coverage for injuries arising \u201cout of any act or omission in connection with prevention or suppression of an assault or battery, committed by any Insured or an employee or agent of the insured.\u201d \u201cEvery word . . . must be presumed to have been employed with a purpose and must be given meaning and effect whenever practicable.\u201d <em>Deutsche Bank Natl. Assn. </em>v. <em>First Am. Title Ins. Co., </em>465 Mass. 741, 748 (2013), quoting from <em>Metropolitan Prop. &amp; Cas. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Morrison, </em>460 Mass. 352, 362 (2011). The use of the words \u201carising out of\u201d before \u201cassault and battery\u201d and, again, before \u201cany act or omission\u201d indicates that the two phrases are distinct and that words restricting the meaning of the former do not operate on the latter. See <em>Kelly </em>v. <em>Figueiredo, </em>223 Conn. 31, 36 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-8\">We understand the phrase \u201ccommitted by any Insured or an employee or agent of the insured\u201d as the Indiana Court of Appeals did in <em>Smock </em>v. <em>American Equity Ins. Co., </em>748 N.E.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>432 (Ind. App. 2001), to restrict the words \u201cact or omission\u201d in the phrase immediately preceding it. See <em>id. </em>at 436 (\u201cThe assault and battery exclusion expressly precludes coverage for bodily injury arising out of an employee\u2019s acts or omissions \u2018in connection with prevention or suppression\u2019 of a battery. . . . By implication that includes batteries by third parties\u201d). We read the comma before the words \u201ccommitted by\u201d as attaching the \u201ccommitted by\u201d language only to the words \u201cact or omission.\u201d Without the comma in that location, it might have appeared that the \u201ccommitted by\u201d wording applied to the words immediately before it, assault or battery. The comma confirms that the plain meaning of the part of the exclusion beginning with \u201cact or omission\u201d is to exclude negligent security claims from coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">Our reading of the exclusion in this case is informed by our holding in <em>Parish, </em>48 Mass. App. Ct. at 70-72. In <em>Parish, </em>we considered the scope of an assault and battery exclusion that excluded \u201c[cjlaims arising out of an assault and/or battery, whether caused by or at the instigation of, or at the direction of, or omission by, the Insured, and/or his employees.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 68. In particular, we considered whether the language of \u201carising out of\u201d was broad enough to encompass claims of negligent security in addition to any claim arising out of direct actions by the insured or its agents. Noting that cases have \u201cconstrue[dj \u2018arising out of\u2019 expansively,\u201d we concluded that the language was broad enough to exclude the claims because without the underlying assault and battery, \u201cthere would have been no personal injuries and, therefore, no basis for a suit against the insured for negligence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 70.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">After <em>Parish, </em>it became clear that the \u201cact or omission\u201d language would not be necessary to exclude negligent security claims from coverage in Massachusetts. But the language used in the policy that we are considering here was taken from a form endorsement from 1997, two years before <em>Parish. </em>The timing is consistent with the conclusion that the language was intended to exclude negligent security claims even though the additional language may not have been necessary, at least under Massachusetts law, by the time the policy became effective in 2001. Moreover, given that the language of the exclusion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>originated in a standard insurance form, using the additional language ensured that negligent security claims would be excluded from coverage across jurisdictions regardless of the jurisdiction\u2019s interpretation of \u201carising out of an assault or battery.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In light of our determination that negligent security claims were excluded by the language interpreted in <em>Parish, </em>the use of additional language specifically addressing negligent security claims confirms that such claims are excluded in this case as well.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">The LeMonses argue that it would be improper to construe the exclusion language to effectively refer to \u201can act or omission committed by\u201d a person because it is not reasonable to speak of someone committing an omission. They ignore, however, that clearly our Legislature believed otherwise when it considered the regulation of insurance. See G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 223A(6)(1), inserted by St. 2012, c. 434, \u00a7 1 (\u201c \u2018Fraudulent life settlement act\u2019 shall mean ... an act or omission committed by a person . . .\u201d). The Supreme Judicial Court also considers this phrasing fit for use. See <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Dist. Commn., </em>439 Mass. 266, 269 n.8 (2003) (inserting word \u201ccommitted\u201d immediately after words \u201cact or omission\u201d in explaining meaning of section of General Laws). Nor are the judges and lawmakers of this Commonwealth unique. See <em>Carroll </em>v. <em>United States, </em>661 F.3d 87, 92 (1st Cir. 2011) (\u201cgovernment may not be held responsible for negligent acts or omissions committed by employees of government contractors whose daily operations are not closely supervised\u201d). Even assuming there is some awkwardness in the concept of \u201ccommitting an omission,\u201d the phrase \u201cact or omission\u201d has become so common in legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>discourse such that verbs like \u201ccommit\u201d can be used readily to refer to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">The LeMonses\u2019 reliance on <em>ALEA London Ltd. </em>v. <em>Woodcock, </em>286 Ga. App. 572 (2007), is unavailing. First, <em>Woodcock </em>relies on a comparison between the assault and battery exclusion at issue there, with respect to bodily injury, and another assault and battery exclusion in the same policy, with respect to liquor liability coverage.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 577. Here, we do not have similar contrasting language. Second, the Georgia court also relies on its narrow interpretation of the phrase \u201carising out of an assault or battery.\u201d See <em>id. </em>at 577-578 (\u201cWe are not persuaded by ALEA\u2019s sweeping assertion that an assault and battery exclusion applies if the claimant\u2019s injury \u2018arose from\u2019 an assault and battery, no matter whom the actor or theory of liability\u201d). However, as has been noted, we have previously rejected such a narrow interpretation. See <em>Parish, </em>48 Mass. App. Ct. at 70-72.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">Finally, we note that the LeMonses\u2019 reading of the exclusion defies common sense. They argue that the insurance policy covers claims that arise out of assaults or batteries by customers or other third parties, but excludes claims arising out of assaults or batteries committed by an employee or agent. It is hard to imagine that Lloyds would have drawn this line in drafting the contract. Far more sensible is Lloyds\u2019s understanding \u2014 that the policy excludes coverage regardless who committed the assault or battery.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\"><em>Conclusion. </em>We conclude that there is no ambiguity in the assault and battery exclusion in the insurance policy provided by Lloyds. The plain language of the exclusion, bolstered by the context of the insurance policy as a whole and by our prior case law, unambiguously excludes coverage in a situation such as this, where the underlying claims stemmed from an assault and battery, regardless who committed that assault and battery.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>We affirm the judgment declaring that the insurer had no duty to defend or indemnify the insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b433-10\">No party claims that the assailants had an affiliation with Gigi\u2019s.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b433-11\">The policy also included an identical assault and battery exclusion with respect to personal injury claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b434-8\">For the sake of simplicity, we use \u201cinsured\u201d herein to refer to the insured itself as well as agents and employees of the insured. There is no need to distinguish between an insured and its agents or employees in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b437-6\">Jurisdictions differ in the interpretation of the scope of an exclusion of claims \u201carising out of an assault or battery\u201d from insurance coverage. See Windt, Insurance Claims &amp; Disputes \u00a7 11.23, at 11-428 to 11-429 (6th ed. 2013). But with respect to policies that include the \u201cact or omission\u201d language, \u201c[c]ourts have had no difficulty in holding that such exclusions eliminate coverage for claims of negligence in failing to stop or prevent the assault, or negligent hiring and supervision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 11-430.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b437-11\">The LeMonses argue that our reading makes the \u201ccommitted by\u201d language redundant because, even without it, only an act or omission of the insured or its agents could be the basis for a negligent security claim. We disagree. It confirms that the clause excludes from the insurance policy negligent security claims \u2014 the exact type of claim brought here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b438-8\">The assault and battery exclusion used the same language, \u201ccommitted by any insured or employee or agent of the insured,\u201d that was used in the exclusion in this case. See <em>Woodcock, supra </em>at 577. By contrast, the liquor liability provision explicitly excluded coverage for failure \u201cto prevent or suppress an assault and/or battery whether caused by the insured, an employee, a patron or any other person.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
