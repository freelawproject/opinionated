The principal issue he raises on appeal concerns the time within which a probationer must complete a treatment program, ordered as a condition of probation, when a date for completion is not otherwise specified. For the reasons that follow, we hold that in such a case the treatment program must be completed within a reasonably prompt period of time as determined initially by the probation department. As a result, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\"><em>Background. </em>The defendant pleaded guilty in Superior Court in 2010 to five charges including kidnapping, assault by means of a dangerous weapon, negligent operation of a motor vehicle, assault and battery, and malicious destruction of property. The judge sentenced him to a State prison term of two years to two years and one day on the assault charge, to a concurrent three month house of correction incarceration on the negligent operation charge (deemed served), and to concurrent terms of probation for five years on the remaining charges, to be served from and after his release from incarceration. The defendant\u2019s terms of probation commenced in August, 2010, when he was released from State prison. Approximately four months later, on January 4, 2011, the defendant appeared before a magistrate in the Superior Court in response to a \u201cNotice of Surrender and Hearing(s) For Alleged Yiolation(s) of Probation\u201d (notice of violation). In open court and in the defendant\u2019s presence, the probation officer informed the magistrate that the defendant was in violation of the conditions of his probation because he had failed to report to probation every fourteen days, to pay the required probation service fee, and to enroll in a batterer\u2019s program. The probation officer added that \u201c[i]f Mr. Bynoe gets himself back in line, we\u2019ll withdraw the surrender.\u201d The probation officer informed the magistrate that the defendant was scheduled to begin a batterer\u2019s program the following Thursday, and for that reason, the probation officer requested that the hearing be continued for sixty days until March 8, 2011. The magistrate agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>In February, 2011, the District Court issued a complaint and an arrest warrant charging the defendant with assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon. On March 8, 2011, the defendant appeared, with counsel, in the Superior Court for the continuation of the probation hearing. The probation officer informed the magistrate that the defendant remained in violation of his probation for the same reasons that were brought to the magistrate\u2019s attention on January 4, 2011. The defendant was then held on the District Court warrant, and a $5,000 cash bail was imposed in the Superior Court probation case. The previous notice of violation was amended to include two additional violations: a positive urine screen for marijuana and the new District Court criminal charge. After several continuances, a final probation revocation hearing took place over several days in July, 2011. In the meantime, the defendant was arraigned on the District Court complaint and held on a high cash bail. A jury trial on that matter was scheduled for September 20, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">At the probation revocation hearing in July, the defendant\u2019s probation officer testified that on May 10, 2011, he mailed and faxed copies of the amended notice of violation, the defendant\u2019s prior criminal record, the police report in the new case pending in the District Court, and the terms and conditions of the defendant\u2019s probation to the defendant\u2019s current attorney. He also testified that the condition of probation relating to a treatment program established at sentencing in 2009 was that the defendant \u201c[ejnter and [cjomplete certified batterer[\u2019s] intervention.\u201d He added that he gave the defendant a list of certified batterer\u2019s programs throughout the State and that the defendant \u201cwas instructed to get enrolled [i]n one of those programs.\u201d Only after the defendant failed to respond did the probation department issue the notice of violation that was the subject of the initial hearing on January 4, 2011.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At the close of the hearing, defense counsel acknowledged that the defendant did not com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>p\u00edete the batterer\u2019s program and argued that the failure was due to the demands of his work schedule.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">With regard to the alleged probation violations, the judge dictated his findings and rulings on the record. He found that the Commonwealth had not sustained its burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, the violation alleging a new criminal offense, but that the Commonwealth had sustained its burden on the remaining violations.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wilcox, </em>446 Mass. 61, 65-66 (2006). The judge took the matter of sentencing under advisement and held a hearing on the matter one week later, on August 4, 2011. The judge imposed a sentence of three to seven years in State prison on the kidnapping charge, deeming the sentence to have commenced on March 8, 2011, a two-year, concurrent sentence of incarceration in the house of correction on the assault and battery charge, and a \u201cfrom and after\u201d term of probation for three years on the malicious destruction of property charge, with the same terms of probation as previously imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">Discussion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> 1. <em>Preliminary probation detention hearing. </em>Contrary to the defendant\u2019s argument, he was not entitled to a pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>liminary probation detention hearing on March 8, 2011, when he voluntarily appeared in the Superior Court and was taken into custody. \u201cThe purpose of the preliminary detention hearing is to protect the rights of the . . . probationer who, being at liberty, is taken into custody for alleged violation of his . . . probation conditions, and detained pending a final revocation hearing.\u201d <em>Fay </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>379 Mass. 498, 504 (1980).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> An examination of the relevant docket entries indicates that on March 8, 2011, the Superior Court magistrate placed the defendant in custody on the warrant issued by the District Court.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thus, the alleged violation of probation was not the cause of the defendant\u2019s detention.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Odoari, </em>397 Mass. 28, 33 n.5 (1986) (\u201c[WJhere a probationer is in custody awaiting prosecution on other charges he is not entitled to a preliminary hearing prior to final revocation of his probation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">2. <em>Written notice of violation. </em>Written notice of the alleged probation violation and disclosure in advance of the hearing of the basis for the violation are two of the essential requisites of due process in probation violation proceedings. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Durling, </em>407 Mass. 108, 113 (1990); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rosseau, </em>464 Mass. 315, 320-322 (2013). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>defendant does not maintain that he did not have actual, timely written notice of the alleged violations and the evidence relied upon by the Commonwealth. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>23 Mass. App. Ct. 612, 616 (1987). Instead, he contends that his rights were violated because he was not served in hand with the notice of violation. See Rule 4(b) of the District Court Rules for Probation Violation Proceedings, Mass. Ann. Laws Court Rules, at 88 (LexisNexis 2013-2014) (\u201cThe Notice of Probation Violation and Hearing shall be served on the probationer in hand or by first-class mail, unless the court orders otherwise\u201d). The record indicates that on March 8, 2011, the probation officer filed with the Superior Court an amended notice of violation that included all of the allegations that were considered at the defendant\u2019s final revocation hearing, and served a copy on the defendant\u2019s attorney. Thereafter, on May 10, 2011, the defendant\u2019s probation officer mailed discovery, including a copy of the amended notice of violation, to the defendant\u2019s new attorney. When, as in this case, a probationer is represented by counsel and probation violation proceedings have commenced, service of an amended notice of violation on the probationer\u2019s attorney satisfies the requirements of due process as well as the requirements of rule 4(b) of the District Court Rules for Probation Violation Proceedings, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">3. <em>Time to complete certified batterer\u2019s program. </em>Due process entitles a probationer \u201cto an opportunity to show not only that he did not violate the conditions [of probation], but also that there was a justifiable excuse for any violation or that revocation is not the appropriate disposition.\u201d <em>Black </em>v. <em>Romano, </em>471 U.S. 606, 612 (1985). In the present case, at the January 4, 2011, hearing before the Superior Court magistrate, the defendant was informed that he was in violation of his probation for failing to enroll in a certified batterer\u2019s program. This hearing took place approximately four months after his release from State prison. The defendant\u2019s probation officer also informed him at the hearing that he would be given sixty days to bring himself into compliance with this condition. According to the probation officer, the defendant was set to begin a batterer\u2019s program during the following week. The defendant was not taken into custody on the District Court warrant until March 8, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>2011, two months after the initial probation surrender hearing. Thus, six months passed following the defendant\u2019s release from prison and his meeting with his probation officer during which time the defendant failed to emol\u00ed in and attend a certified batterer\u2019s program.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">The premises of defendant\u2019s argument are correct. A probationer is entitled to \u201cfair warning of conduct\u201d that may lead to a revocation of probation, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Al Saud, </em>459 Mass. 221, 232 (2011), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ruiz, </em>453 Mass. 474, 479 (2009), \u201cclear guidelines\u201d as to what actions on his part may result in a violation of probation, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lally, </em>55 Mass. App. Ct. 601, 603 (2002), and \u201ca reliable, accurate evaluation\u201d of whether there has been a violation of the conditions of probation. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Durling, </em>407 Mass, at 116. However, the defendant\u2019s conclusion that a condition of probation requiring completion of a treatment program that does not specify a time by which it must be completed is impermissibly vague, does not follow from these premises, and is not an accurate statement of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Power, </em>420 Mass. 410, 421 (1995), quoting from <em>Grayned </em>v. <em>Rockford, </em>408 U.S. 104, 110 (1972), the court explained that a condition of probation is not impermissibly vague so long as it \u201cis adequately clear so as to inform the defendant of what conduct is prohibited. Of course, we are necessarily \u2018[condemned to the use of words [and thus] we can never expect mathematical certainty from our language.\u2019 \u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kendrick, </em>446 Mass. 72, 77 (2006) (probation condition that defendant have \u201cno contact\u201d with minors under sixteen years of age provided sufficient notice that he was prohibited from displaying his antique automobile at car show attended by minors). When a defendant is required to attend and complete an inpatient or outpatient treatment program, such as a certified batterer\u2019s program, it is customary for the probation officer to assist the defendant in promptly entering into the program. In this case, the defendant\u2019s probation officer met with the defendant after his release from State prison, gave him a list of certified batterer\u2019s programs throughout the State, and instructed him to enroll in one. When no specific date is established by the sentencing judge by which time a probationer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>must complete a treatment program, the defendant\u2019s obligation is to act with reasonable promptness to comply with the schedule established by his probation officer.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u201cThe courts run probation and its terms, those who receive the benefits of it do not.\u201d <em>White </em>v. <em>State, </em>560 N.E.2d 45, 47 (Ind. 1990).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">The practice is that the probation officer, in consultation with the probationer, establishes the date by which time the probationer must be enrolled in or must have completed a required treatment program. If the defendant does not agree with the timetable established by his probation officer, the matter may be reviewed administratively, either by the chief probation officer or his designee, or in accordance with a procedure established by the Commissioner of Probation. If a satisfactory resolution is not achieved, the probationer may file a motion for a judicial review by the sentencing judge. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McGovern, </em>183 Mass. 238, 240 (1903) (nature of probation is not binding agreement between Commonwealth and defendant that once made cannot be changed). See also <em>Buckley </em>v. <em>Quincy Div. of the Dist. Ct. Dept., </em>395 Mass. 815, 817-818 (1985) (courts retain common-law authority to modify conditions of probation).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>When the probation department establishes a timetable for the defendant to submit to an evaluation, testing, or to enroll in a treatment program, the burden is on the probationer to demonstrate that he is unable to comply with the timetable. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Canadyan, </em>458 Mass. 574, 578-579 (2010) (burden is on probationer to demonstrate that through no fault of his own he is unable to comply with condition of probation). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Al Saud, </em>459 Mass, at 231 (\u201cA defendant who does not even attempt to make a good faith effort to comply with the terms of his or her probation cannot complain later that compliance was impossible\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">The defendant offers no support for his contention that when the sentencing judge does not include in the terms of probation a date by which a specific type of treatment program must be completed, the probationer has until the end of the probationary period to satisfy the requirement. Probation is designed principally to achieve the twin goals of rehabilitation of the offender and protection of the public. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pike, </em>428 Mass. 393, 403 (1998). Defense counsel made reference to the defendant\u2019s work schedule as a reason for his failure to enroll in a certified batterer\u2019s program. Although employment is often a vital component of a probationer\u2019s rehabilitative program and may itself be a condition of probation, the law does not leave it to the probationer to decide when and how to comply with the terms of probation. It is the probation officer, after consultation with the probationer, who initially establishes a plan for how the probationer will comply with the conditions of probation, including the probationer\u2019s work schedule, if any, the date by which an evaluation or treatment program must be completed, the identity of the specific service provider, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>location and hours of attendance. This practice is not an unlawful delegation of authority to the probation officer but, instead, a practical method to ensure compliance with court orders.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">4. <em>Sentencing. </em>The defendant asks this court to review the sentence of not less than three nor more than seven years to State prison imposed after his probation was revoked on the kidnapping charge, along with a concurrent sentence to the house of correction on the assault and battery charge and a \u201cfrom and after\u201d sentence of probation on the malicious destruction charge. His arguments are unavailing.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> It is important to keep in mind that while appellate courts \u201chave the power and responsibility to correct unconstitutional or otherwise illegal sentences, we have no authority to review a sentence that is within the permissible range of sentences set by a statute for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>given offense and is otherwise lawful.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barros, </em>460 Mass. 1015, 1016 (2011) (citation omitted). The sentence imposed was consistent with the recommendation made by the probation officer, who had attempted without success to supervise the defendant since 2010. The record reflects the judge\u2019s thoughtful consideration of \u201cinformation that was available to the first judge as well as information that has become available since the initial conviction and disposition.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Doucette, </em>81 Mass. App. Ct. 740, 745 (2012). The record does not support the defendant\u2019s assertion that he was punished a second time for his 2009 convictions.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">\n<em>Order revoking probation affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b47-6\">The defendant\u2019s probation officer also testified that following the defendant\u2019s 2009 change of plea in the Superior Court, he was instructed that he was required to report to the probation department every fourteen days. The defendant reported on December 2, 2010, but missed his next two appointments. After the defendant appeared before the Superior Court magistrate on January 4, 2011, he missed his next three probation appointments. He reported again on February 22, 2011, and then appeared in court on March 8, 2011, when he was taken into custody on the District Court warrant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b48-7\">The judge found that the defendant signed the conditions of probation; that he received notice of the five alleged violations of probation; that he received notice of the reasons the probation officer alleged the defendant was in violation; and that he had a full opportunity to present evidence on his behalf and to cross-examine the witnesses. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kelsey, </em>464 Mass. 315, 319-320 (2013). The judge also found that based on the preponderance of the evidence standard, the defendant violated four of the five conditions: he failed to enter and complete a batterer\u2019s program; he failed to report every fourteen days; he had a positive urine screen for marijuana; and he had not paid the required supervision fee.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b48-8\">The defendant argues at several points that while these proceedings took place in the Superior Court, he was prejudiced as a result of the failure to follow the procedures set forth in the District Court Rules for Probation Violation Proceedings. See Mass. Ann. Laws Court Rules, District Court Rules for Probation Violation Proceedings, at 80 et seq. (LexisNexis 2013-2014). Those rules are \u201capplicable only by analogy to proceedings in the Superior Court.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Al Saud, </em>459 Mass. 221, 226 n.8 (2011). Moreover, as discussed <em>infra, </em>insofar as the rules embody the requirements of due process in probation violation proceedings, the proceedings in this case complied with the essential requirements of the current rules. The District Court has proposed amendments to make its probation violation rules conform to the case law issued since they were adopted in 2000, to clarify certain procedural requirements, and to eliminate ambiguities.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b49-6\">See Rule 8(a) of the District Court Rules for Probation Violation Proceedings, <em>supra </em>at 100 (\u201cA preliminary probation violation hearing shall be conducted only when the Probation Department seeks to hold a probationer in custody on the basis of an alleged violation of probation pending the conduct of a full probation violation hearing. The issues to be determined at a preliminary probation violation hearing are whether probable cause exists to believe that the probationer has violated a condition of the probation order, and, if so, whether the probationer should be held in custody\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b49-8\">This is not a case in which the judicial determination of probable cause in support of the issuance of a criminal complaint, see Mass.R.Crim.P. 3(g), as appearing in 442 Mass. 1505 (2004), was used as a substitute for a preliminary probation detention hearing in circumstances where the new criminal complaint is the sole basis for the probation violation. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Morse, </em>50 Mass. App. Ct. 582, 591 n.ll (2000). In this case, the defendant was detained in the Superior Court on the District Court warrant, and eventually transported to the District Court where he was arraigned and held on a cash bail until after the date of his final probation revocation hearing in the Superior Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b49-9\">It is a common practice in cases such as this for defense counsel to request an order of bail on the probation violation case to establish a basis for arguing that the defendant should receive credit against any subsequent sentence of incarceration that might be imposed if the defendant\u2019s probation is revoked. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Milton, </em>427 Mass. 18, 24-25 (1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b52-6\">As the Florida Supreme Court has observed, \u201c[A] probation order that requires the completion of a drug treatment program but fails to specify time parameters should be read in a commonsense manner. Accordingly, a probationer who has been given the privilege of being placed on probation, <em>in lieu of serving jail time, </em>is put on adequate notice that the treatment program should be undertaken at the beginning of the probationary period and that, if he or she is discharged for nonattendance, he or she may not have another chance to complete the program.\u201d <em>Lawson </em>v. <em>State, </em>969 So. 2d 222, 235 (Fla. 2007).

The purpose of the office of Probation Officer is to assist in carrying out the conditions by finding a particular agency that has the ability and interest to provide the means of performing the service.

The defendant asserts that this condition did not authorize the probation officer to require him to participate in random drug testing. The drug test was administered on January 4, 2011, the date of the defendant\u2019s first violation hearing. The order to submit to a single drug test was not a new and more punitive condition of probation, but simply a reasonable means of enforcing a term of probation established by the sentencing judge. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Duff, </em>831 F.2d 176, 178-179 (9th Cir. 1987). Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lally, </em>55 Mass. App. Ct. at 603. The defendant also argues that he is entitled to relief because there was no evidence offered at the final hearing that the drug test was reliable. There is no force to this argument because the defendant admitted he had smoked marijuana within a month of the test. The defendant\u2019s further admission that he had a previous criminal case involving possession of marijuana continued without a finding provided the sentencing judge with a basis for imposing this condition of probation. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gomes, </em>73 Mass. App. Ct. 857, 859-860 (2009). Finally, with regard to the violation for nonpayment of the probation service fee, the record indicates that the defendant acknowledged he was over $600 in arrears at the time of the final hearing and had made only one monthly payment since September, 2010. Even if the probation department should have permitted him to make a lump sum payment of $360 on March 8, 2011, he was in violation of this condition of probation at the time of the final hearing, and this violation was a valid basis for an order of revocation. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pena, </em>462 Mass. 183, 186 n.4 (2012).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
