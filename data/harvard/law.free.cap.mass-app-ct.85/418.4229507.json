(Merrill), in the 2002 jury trial of this action. The plaintiffs claim that in that litigation Bingham wrongfully withheld documents relevant to the issue whether Merrill, in handling the accounts of Benistar Property Exchange Trust Company, Inc. (Benistar), knew that Benistar was trading with money belonging to third parties. We hold that Bingham lacked an adequate legal basis, under the guise of the work product doctrine, for its decisions to withhold information that Merrill employees had viewed certain Benistar Web pages describing its business as an intermediary for third-party funds and then to present a defense claiming that no Merrill employees had viewed the very same Web pages.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As a result, we vacate that portion of the final judgment entering judgment in favor of Bingham on the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for sanctions.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As explained below, there remain certain issues that require resolution by a fact finder, and thus, we remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b451-9\"><em>Background. </em>For background regarding the 2002 trial and the underlying dispute, we refer to <em>Cahaly </em>v. <em>Benistar Property Exch. Trust Co., </em>451 Mass. 343 (2008) <em>(Cahaly),</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> </em>in which the Supreme Judicial Court affirmed the order of the Superior Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>judge granting the plaintiffs a new trial. The documents at issue here came to light during the preparation of the second trial in 2009, when Merrill, then represented by different counsel, produced the documents as responsive to document requests served by the plaintiffs in 2001. As a result, after the second trial, the plaintiffs moved for sanctions against Merrill and Bingham, intervener on the issue of sanctions, and the judge conducted an eight-day evidentiary hearing on the motion. He adopted most of the 334 stipulated facts submitted by the parties and made comprehensive additional findings of fact, set out in his January 11, 2011, memorandum and order. We summarize those facts here, adding additional materials from the record where noted.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">Merrill retained Bingham in June, 2001, to represent it in connection with the complaints filed by the plaintiffs, who were former clients of Benistar and who claimed losses of $8 million as a result of Benistar\u2019s wrongdoing in investing the plaintiffs\u2019 funds. John R. Snyder, a Bingham partner and experienced trial attorney, became Merrill\u2019s lead trial counsel, and proceeded to gather information in response to discovery requests. In speaking with Merrill employees involved with the Benistar accounts, Snyder was informed that none of them knew that the money in those accounts belonged to third parties, and that on September 20, 2000, Benistar\u2019s trading was restricted because of losses rather than because of concerns that the accounts contained third-party funds. Snyder also determined that none of Merrill\u2019s employees had visited the \u00a7 1031 pages of the Benistar Web site,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> which explained that Benistar\u2019s business was to serve as an intermediary for third-party funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">On July 15, 2002, Snyder received a file from Joseph Pash, a Merrill in-house lawyer, which Pash had obtained from Martin Malia, an options specialist in Merrill\u2019s compliance department. The file contained documents indicating that on the morning of September 20, 2000, the day Merrill ordered Benistar\u2019s trading restricted, Malia had visited the \u00a7 1031 pages of the Benistar Web site. Those pages contained information about \u00a7 1031 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>property exchanges and revealed that Benistar\u2019s business was as an intermediary to hold funds for clients engaged in \u00a7 1031 property exchanges. The pages contained a question and answer section, including the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-5\">\u201cCan I trust Benistar Property Exchange with My Money? . . . [W]e protect your assets: We have accounts with major banking and investment firms \u2014 accounts under our sole control, as required for these exchanges. . . . Our accounts are restricted to paying out funds only for a subsequent closing, or to return funds to the original property owner. We distribute funds only at your written request.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">The judge found that the \u00a7 1031 pages of the Benistar Web site disclosed that Benistar handled other people\u2019s money and caused Malia to suspect that Benistar was trading other people\u2019s money through its Merrill accounts. The judge also found that this information concerned Malia because of the losses in Merrill\u2019s Benistar accounts, but that the Web site did not inform Malia that Benistar\u2019s options trading was a breach of Benistar\u2019s duty to its clients to hold their funds in low-risk escrow accounts. Also in the file was a facsimile transmission (fax) from Malia to Thomas Rasmussen, a Merrill administrative manager, sent at 11:04 a.m. on September 20, 2000, attaching the \u00a7 1031 Web site pages.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">Upon reviewing the Malia file, Snyder thought that some of the documents might be protected under the work product doctrine. When he spoke with Malia, Malia indicated that he performed the Web site search before he made the decision to restrict the accounts and that the information on the question and answer page gave him some suspicion of embezzlement. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>Malia also told Snyder that in September, 2000, he reported to Dennis Pape, an attorney working as a compliance supervisor at Merrill, and after September 22, 2000, he was working with an in-house lawyer of Merrill\u2019s office of general counsel.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">Snyder discussed with Merrill\u2019s in-house lawyers whether the Malia file was protected from disclosure under the work product doctrine. They considered that Malia operated under the umbrella of the office of general counsel, that he acted on occasion when litigation was anticipated, and that he was generally under the direction of attorneys. Pash determined that the documents were protected work product, and Snyder agreed.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We add that Snyder testified at the evidentiary hearing that he did not know whether he conducted legal research in making the work product determination, but he did not think that Bingham\u2019s billing records would reflect such research.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">On June 19, 2002, the trial judge granted the plaintiffs\u2019 emergency motion to compel evidence of visits by Merrill employees to the Benistar Web site. Merrill responded that no nonprivileged documents had been found. In October, 2002, after receiving the Malia file, Bingham drafted supplements to several of Merrill\u2019s interrogatory answers concerning Merrill\u2019s knowledge of Benistar\u2019s business and visits to the Web site. Those responses would have disclosed the fact that Malia had viewed the \u00a7 1031 pages. In the end, Snyder decided not to serve the supplemental answers, following his determination that the Malia file was protected work product.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">We also add from the record that prior to receiving the Malia file, Bingham had filed a motion for summary judgment, which contained the following representation: \u201cAt no time prior to the transfer of the accounts did any employee at Merrill Lynch learn that the funds in the Benistar accounts were being held by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>Benistar as a third party intermediary for real estate transactions or that those funds were Benistar client escrowed funds.\u201d In addition, the parties stipulated that Merrill\u2019s portion of the first revised joint pretrial memorandum, dated September 25, 2002, included the following: \u201cAt no time prior to the transfer of the Benistar accounts from Merrill Lynch to Paine Webber did any employee at Merrill Lynch learn that the funds in the accounts were being held by Benistar as a third party intermediary for real estate transactions or that those funds were Benistar client escrow funds.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">At the hearing on the motion for sanctions, the parties stipulated that at the 2002 trial, Snyder, in examining Rasmussen, asked whether Rasmussen knew in 2000 that Benistar acted as a third-party intermediary or escrow agent handling other people\u2019s money, and Rasmussen testified that he did not. Rasmussen also testified that he never visited the Benistar Web site before the accounts were transferred to UBS Paine Webber, Inc., and that he had never thought to do so. The record further discloses that Snyder told the jury, in closing, that \u201cthe Merrill people\u201d did not know that the funds in the accounts belonged to third parties, and that the witnesses all said they did not know what a \u00a7 1031 exchange was and that there was no reason for them to go to the \u00a7 1031 \u201cbutton\u201d on the Web site. According to the record, in Merrill\u2019s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, Merrill argued that the plaintiffs \u201chave failed even to present sufficient evidence to support a reasonable inference that Merrill knew that the Benistar accounts contained third party funds.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">Following the sanctions hearing, the judge concluded that Snyder acted in good faith in failing to disclose the Malia file and in presenting a defense at the 2002 trial that included the claim that Merrill employees had not viewed the \u00a7 1031 pages of the Benistar Web site.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\"><em>Discussion. </em>The plaintiffs maintain that Snyder was prohibited from not disclosing the fact, under the work product doctrine, that certain Merrill employees had seen the \u00a7 1031 pages of the Benistar Web site, and then asserting, as part of Merrill\u2019s defense, that Merrill employees had not seen the \u00a7 1031 pages of the Benistar Web site. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>We review the judge\u2019s decision regarding sanctions for abuse of discretion. \u201c[Ojur function is to determine whether the judge abused that discretion, which includes considering whether proper legal standards were applied and whether there was reasonable support for the judge\u2019s evaluation of the facts.\u201d <em>Psy-Ed Corp. </em>v. Klein, 62 Mass. App. Ct. 110, 114 (2004), quoting from <em>Van Christo Advertising, Inc. </em>v. <em>M/A-COM/LCS, </em>426 Mass. 410, 417 (1998). In so doing, we accept the judge\u2019s findings of fact as true unless they are clearly erroneous. \u201cOn the other hand, to ensure that the ultimate findings and conclusions are consistent with the law, we scrutinize without deference the legal standard which the judge applied to the facts.\u201d <em>Kendall </em>v. <em>Selvaggio, </em>413 Mass. 619, 621 (1992). See <em>Panagakos </em>v. <em>Collins, </em>80 Mass. App. Ct. 697, 702 (2011) (clearly erroneous standard does not protect findings based on incorrect legal standard).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">1. <em>The work product doctrine. </em>The Massachusetts work product doctrine derives from <em>Hickman </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>329 U.S. 495 (1947), and may be invoked to protect from discovery certain types of documents prepared by a party\u2019s attorney, or nonlawyer representative, in anticipation of litigation. \u201cThe work product doctrine is codified in Mass.R.Civ.P. 26(b)(3), [365 Mass. 772 (1974)]. . . .\u201d <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>Slade Assocs., </em>463 Mass. 181, 194 (2012). The doctrine is intended \u201cto prevent one party from piggybacking on the adversary\u2019s preparation,\u201d <em>Commissioner of Rev. </em>v. <em>Comcast Corp., </em>453 Mass. 293, 312 (2009) <em>(Comcast Corp.), </em>quoting from <em>United States </em>v. <em>Adlman, </em>68 F.3d 1495, 1501 (2d Cir. 1995), and thus protects from disclosure the attorney\u2019s \u201cmental impressions, conclusions, opinions, or legal theories\u201d regarding the litigation. Mass.R.Civ.P. 26(b)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">The judge correctly cited the legal principle from <em>Comcast Corp., </em>i.e., that the work product doctrine may be invoked to protect documents that a party\u2019s nonlawyer representative prepared, or obtained, in anticipation of litigation. Much of the judge\u2019s analysis focused on whether Snyder reasonably believed that Malia\u2019s investigation of the Benistar account in September, 2000, was undertaken in his role as Merrill\u2019s legal representative and in anticipation of litigation, and the judge credited both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>Snyder and Bingham\u2019s expert in concluding that Snyder\u2019s decision to withhold the documents on those grounds had an adequate basis in the law and was made in good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">However, in <em>Comcast Corp., </em>the Supreme Judicial Court went further and identified two important qualifications to the work product doctrine that bear directly on the facts of this case and were absent from the judge\u2019s analysis. First, the court noted that work product may be subject to disclosure upon a showing of a substantial need for the material and that its equivalent cannot be obtained by other means. <em>Comcast Corp., supra </em>at 314. See <em>Chambers </em>v. <em>Gold Metal Bakery, Inc., </em>464 Mass. 383, 391 n.22 (2013). Substantial need is shown where, as here, the work product at issue is central to the parties\u2019 substantive claims. See <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>Slade Assocs., supra </em>at 195, citing <em>Madanes </em>v. <em>Madanes, </em>199 F.R.D. 135, 150 (S.D.N.Y 2001). In fact, the plaintiffs specifically sought, and the trial judge ordered, that Merrill produce evidence of Web site visits.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">The second qualification noted by the court is that the doctrine encompasses two types of work product, fact and opinion. <em>Com-cast Corp., supra. </em>The court distinguished the degree of protection afforded each type, explaining that the rule affords protection primarily against disclosure of an attorney\u2019s opinion, that is, \u201cthe mental impressions, conclusions, opinions, or legal theories of an attorney or other representative of a party concerning the litigation.\u201d <em>Ibid., </em>quoting from Mass.R.Civ.P. 26(b)(3). Fact work product, on the other hand, receives far less protection. <em>Comcast Corp., supra. </em>It has long been held that \u201c[wjhere relevant and non-privileged facts remain hidden in an attorney\u2019s file and where production of those facts is essential to the preparation of one\u2019s case, discovery may properly be had.\u201d <em>Hickman </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>329 U.S. at 511. See <em>Fleet Natl. Bank </em>v. <em>The Gloucester Corp., </em>150 F.R.D. 10, 14 n.6 (D. Mass. 1993) (litigants cannot use work product doctrine to shield relevant facts from discovery). See also <em>Resolution Trust Corp. </em>v. <em>Dabney, </em>73 F.3d 262, 266 (10th Cir. 1995) (doctrine principally guards against disclosing attorney\u2019s strategies and legal impressions, and does not protect \u201cfacts concerning the creation of work product or facts contained within work product\u201d); <em>Koch Materials Co. </em>v. <em>Shore Slurry Seal, Inc., </em>208 F.R.D. 109, 122 (D.N.J. 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>With these qualifications in mind, we conclude that Snyder lacked an adequate basis in law to support his decision to withhold, as protected work product, the significant facts that Malia visited the \u00a7 1031 pages on the Benistar Web site on September 20,2000, and then sent those pages by fax to Rasmussen. \u201cSimply identifying what documents an attorney reviewed, what documents were provided by a consultant, or what documents were provided to the client, in each instance without any requirement to describe content, reveals nothing about the attorney\u2019s (or the consultant\u2019s or the client\u2019s) opinion or impression of any of the documents, or any conclusions the attorney (or consultant or client) drew from them.\u201d <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>Slade Assocs., </em>463 Mass, at 201, citing <em>Bamberg </em>v. <em>KPMG LLP, </em>219 F.R.D. 33, 36 (D. Mass. 2003). See <em>In re San Juan Dupont Plaza Hotel Fire Litigation, </em>859 F.2d 1007, 1014-1018 (1st Cir. 1988). Snyder\u2019s failure to supplement the interrogatories seeking that factual information, and his continued assertion, in pleadings and at trial, that Merrill employees had not visited the \u00a7 1031 Web site, were without legal justification.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">Even assuming, without deciding, that Snyder was reasonable in his belief that Mafia\u2019s visit to the \u00a7 1031 Web site pages, and Mafia\u2019s fax to Rasmussen containing those pages, revealed Mafia\u2019s mental impressions, we discern no adequate basis in the law for Snyder\u2019s belief that he could withhold the information and still assert a defense claiming just the opposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">Plainly, whether Merrill employees had visited the Benistar Web site, and what knowledge they gleaned therefrom, were significant points of contention in the parties\u2019 dispute. In <em>Ward </em>v. <em>Peabody, </em>380 Mass. 805, 817-818 (1980), the court explained that protection for work product does not extend to evidence of the \u201cwords and deeds\u201d of an attorney when the inquiry bears on an issue in dispute, in that case the activities of a contractor and its law firm alleged to have improperly influenced the award of public contracts. \u201c[Wjhen the activities of counsel are inquired into because they are at issue in the action before the Court, there is cause for production of documents that deal with such activities, though they are \u2018work product.\u2019 4 Moore\u2019s, Federal Practice par. 26.62[4] at 26-447 (2d ed. 1979).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>818.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> More recently, in <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>Slade Assocs., </em>463 Mass, at 195, the Supreme Judicial Court reiterated that work product was not shielded from discovery if the parties\u2019 dispute \u201cputs in play\u201d the knowledge of the plaintiff and her attorney, in that case knowledge of the location of a parcel of land, which was pertinent to the discovery rule asserted by the plaintiffs in response to a statute of limitations defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\">The fact that a Merrill employee, lawyer or nonlawyer, knew that Benistar\u2019s business was as an intermediary for third-party funds was significant to the plaintiffs in making out their claim for aiding and abetting against Merrill. Moreover, the evidence of Malia\u2019s visit to the \u00a7 1031 pages of the Benistar Web site on September 20, 2000, and his transmission of those pages by fax to Rasmussen, ran directly counter to the heart of Merrill\u2019s defense that it had no such knowledge. Indeed, the plaintiffs\u2019 failure to provide such evidence was repeatedly highlighted by Merrill as a fatal flaw in the plaintiffs\u2019 case throughout the 2002-2003 proceedings. Its disclosure would have revealed facts that would have contradicted the observations of the trial judge,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> this court,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and the Supreme Judicial Court,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> in their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>respective rulings, that evidence of Merrill\u2019s knowledge of the nature of Benistar\u2019s business was lacking in the 2002 trial. See Mass. R. Prof. C. 3.3(a)(1), 426 Mass. 1383 (1998) (lawyer shall not knowingly make false statement of material fact or law to tribunal). It likely would have led the plaintiffs to the existence of other relevant facts and would have been useful in cross-examining the Merrill witnesses, Rasmussen in particular, who denied ever seeing the information. See <em>Hickman </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>329 U.S. at 511. See also Mass. R. Prof. C. 3.3(a)(4), 426 Mass. 1383 (1998) (lawyer shall not knowingly offer evidence that lawyer knows to be false).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">These important qualifications to the work product doctrine, which relate directly to the undisputed facts of this case, were not addressed in the judge\u2019s rulings when he relied on <em>Comcast Corp. </em>to conclude that Snyder had an adequate basis in law to support his work product determination. We are also of the view that Snyder\u2019s persistence in pursuing a defense that included Merrill\u2019s lack of knowledge of the nature of Benistar\u2019s business and the \u00a7 1031 Web site pages calls into question his good faith. Accordingly, the judge\u2019s ultimate finding that Snyder acted reasonably and in good faith in withholding critical documents as work product must be reassessed in light of the legal principles we have set out here. Nevertheless, reasonableness and good faith are determinations we leave to the fact finder, who is in a better position to assess the credibility of witnesses and to weigh the evidence, in the context of the applicable law. See <em>Cahaly, supra </em>at 369. See, e.g., <em>Psy-Ed Corp. </em>v. <em>Klein, </em>62 Mass. App. Ct. at 114. For that reason, the matter is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">2. <em>Authority for imposition of sanctions. </em>The plaintiffs no longer press the ground of fraud on the court as a basis for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>imposing sanctions. But the plaintiffs maintain that Bingham\u2019s conduct was sufficiently egregious to warrant sanctions pursuant to the inherent power of the trial court. See generally <em>Sommer </em>v. <em>Maharaj, </em>451 Mass. 615, 621-622 (2008); <em>Munshani </em>v. <em>Signal Lake Venture Fund II, LP, </em>60 Mass. App. Ct. 714, 719 n.6 (2004) (court\u2019s inherent power to impose sanctions for attorney misconduct was not limited to instances of fraud on the court).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">The plaintiffs additionally rely on Mass.R.Civ.P. 11, 365 Mass. 753 (1974), requiring that pleadings be based on an attorney\u2019s reasonable inquiry and an absence of bad faith. See <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Nutter, McClennen &amp; Fish, </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. 137, 142 (1996). The rule requires \u201cat least some level of reasonable inquiry\u201d into the factual and legal basis supporting the pleading. <em>Psy-Ed Corp. </em>v. <em>Klein, </em>62 Mass. App. Ct. at 113. See <em>Van Christo Advertising, Inc. </em>v. <em>M/A-COM/LCS, </em>426 Mass, at 416-417 (we do not condone \u201can attorney\u2019s \u2018wilful ignorance\u2019 of facts and law which would have been known had the attorney simply not consciously disregarded them\u201d). In ruling on a motion for mie 11 sanctions, a judge may consider whether the attorney\u2019s misconduct was the result of a \u201cgenuine, professional judgment,\u201d see <em>Psy-Ed Corp. </em>v. <em>Klein, supra </em>at 117, or was instead to secure a tactical advantage by hampering the opposing party\u2019s presentation of its case, in violation of the rules of court and of professional conduct. <em>Munshani </em>v. <em>Signal Lake Venture Fund II, PL, supra </em>at 720.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">Finally, the plaintiffs urge that sanctions be imposed against Bingham for discovery violations, for its failure to supplement the plaintiffs\u2019 interrogatories in 2002. See, e.g., <em>Keene </em>v. <em>Brigham &amp; Women\u2019s Hosp., Inc., </em>56 Mass. App. Ct. 10, 21 (2002), <em>S.C. </em>439 Mass. 223, 235 (2003); <em>Short </em>v. <em>Marinas USA Ltd. Partnership, </em>78 Mass. App. Ct. 848, 853 &amp; n.7 (2011). We defer to the judge on remand to determine whether sanctions are warranted on any of those grounds, as determined by the judge\u2019s further findings on Bingham\u2019s good faith and the nature and effect of the violations.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">3. <em>Benistar defendants\u2019 appeal. </em>The Benistar defendants ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>peal from the judge\u2019s denial of their motion for a new trial. The judge relied principally on <em>Cahaly, supra </em>at 362-368, wherein the court denied Benistar\u2019s motion for a new trial based on the newly discovered evidence addressed in that case. We agree with the judge that the Benistar defendants have not demonstrated that the documents produced by Merrill in 2009 require a different outcome.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\"><em>Conclusion. </em>The order denying the Benistar defendants\u2019 motion for a new trial is affirmed. Paragraph E of the final judgment entered on February 7, 2011, is vacated as to intervener Bingham only, and the matter is remanded to the Superior Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b451-10\">Also before us is the Benistar defendants\u2019 appeal from the denial of their motion for a new trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b451-11\">Final judgment entered on February 7, 2011.
