(Teradyne), for gender discrimination and retaliation. After an eight-day trial, the jury found for Teradyne on Kiely\u2019s discrimination claim and for Kiely on her retaliation claim; although Kiely failed to obtain any award of compensatory damages from the jury, they did award her $1.1 million in punitive damages. Acting upon Teradyne\u2019s timely postjudgment motion under Mass.R. Civ.P. 50(b), as amended, 428 Mass. 1402 (1998), the trial judge denied Teradyne\u2019s request for full judgment notwithstanding the verdict (judgment n.o.v.) but allowed its alternative request to vacate, in its entirety, the jury\u2019s award of punitive damages. The judge also denied Kiely\u2019s motion for attorney\u2019s fees under G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 9, as she was not a \u201cprevailing party.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b464-9\">Case No. 13-P-505 concerns Kiely\u2019s appeal from the modified judgment, in which she contends that her gender discrimination claim must be remanded for a new trial due to the trial judge\u2019s failure to give certain jury instructions and that the judge erred in vacating the award of punitive damages on the retaliation claim. In its cross appeal, Teradyne contends that the judge erred in denying its motion for judgment n.o.v. as to Kiely\u2019s retaliation claim. We discern no error in the trial judge\u2019s jury instructions, her decision to vacate the jury\u2019s award of punitive damages, or her denial of the defendant\u2019s motion for judgment n.o.v.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-10\">In No. 13-P-1217, Kiely contends separately that the judge erred in denying her postjudgment motion for attorney\u2019s fees under G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 9, even in the absence of compensatory or punitive damages. We disagree and affirm this order.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-11\">1. <em>Background. </em>Kiely worked at Teradyne from 1982 until <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>2006, primarily as a test technician in Teradyne\u2019s global customer services (GCS) department, which was responsible for repairing computer circuit boards returned to Teradyne from its customers around the world. In 2004, Kiely was promoted to group leader in the GCS repair group, a position that involved less repair work and more administrative duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">Between 2000 and 2006, by a series of layoffs, Teradyne reduced the number of GCS test technicians from approximately thirty-one to three.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Kiely survived these layoffs until November 2, 2006, when the last group of three test technicians, Kiely, Dennis Hodgdon, and Steve Senecal, were told they would be laid off effective December 2, 2006. Kiely filed a gender discrimination charge before the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination (MCAD) on November 21, 2006, with notice being sent to Teradyne\u2019s general counsel\u2019s office and a human resources (HR) manager, Bill Bums.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">Shortly after these layoffs, Teradyne\u2019s assembly test division (ATD), a different department from GCS where Kiely had been working, recognized a need for two test technicians to service a particular account. Jay Fitton, a manager in the ATD department, was designated to make the hiring decisions; he learned that Kiely, Hodgdon, and Senecal were the last three employees to have been let go from GCS and so he considered them for the two positions. Contrary to Teradyne\u2019s usual practice, none of the three was offered an interview or told that they were being considered for the newly available positions.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">Bums, the HR manager, instmcted Susan Blair, another HR manager, to tell Fitton to document the hiring decision.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This directive was also a departure from Teradyne\u2019s typical hiring practice. Fitton testified, without contradiction, that the HR <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>department never explained the reasons why he was told to document the hiring process or that Kiely had filed a discrimination charge at the MCAD. Ultimately, the ATD department rehired Hodgdon, by December 6, 2006, and Senecal, by January 15, 2007. Fitton admitted that his inquiries concluded, as a practical matter, after learning of the technical skills of Hodgdon and Senecal, but that he had not learned of Kiely\u2019s. In a memorandum explaining his decision, Fitton stated he based his decision to rehire Hodgdon and Senecal on their superior qualifications as test technicians and on the fact that Kiely\u2019s most recent experience had been mostly administrative.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">2. <em>Discussion, </em>a. <em>Punitive damages. </em>We first address Kiely\u2019s claim that the trial judge erred in allowing Teradyne\u2019s postjudgment motion to vacate the jury\u2019s award of punitive damages. When considering a defendant\u2019s motion for judgment n.o.v., \u201cthe evidence is viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, and all evidence favorable to the [defendant] is disregarded.\u201d <em>Ciccarelli </em>v. <em>School Dept. of Lowell, </em>70 Mass. App. Ct. 787, 791 (2007). The verdict must be sustained if \u201canywhere in the evidence, from whatever source derived, any combination of circumstances could be found from which a reasonable inference could be drawn in favor of the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Haddad </em>v. <em>WalMart Stores, Inc. (No. 1), </em>455 Mass. 91, 94 n.5 (2009), quoting from <em>Boothby </em>v. <em>Texon, Inc., </em>414 Mass. 468, 470 (1993). Motions for judgment n.o.v. should be granted \u201ccautiously and sparingly,\u201d Wright &amp; Miller, Federal Practice &amp; Procedure \u00a7 2524, at 248 (3d ed. 2008), and should be granted only if the trial judge is satisfied that the jury \u201cfailed to exercise an honest and reasonable judgment in accordance with the controlling principles of law,\u201d <em>Turnpike Motors, Inc. </em>v. <em>Newbury Group, Inc., </em>413 Mass. 119, 127 (1992), quoting from <em>Robertson </em>v. <em>Gaston Snow &amp; Ely Bartlett, </em>404 Mass. 515, 520, cert, denied, 493 U.S. 894 (1989). However, a party cannot avoid entry of judgment n.o.v. if any essential element of her case rests on a \u201cmere scintilla\u201d of evidence. <em>Stapleton </em>v. <em>Macchi, </em>401 Mass. 725, 728 (1988), quoting from <em>Hartmann </em>v. <em>Boston Herald-Traveler Corp., </em>323 Mass. 56, 59 (1948).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">\u201cChapter 151B provides for the award of punitive damages <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>in appropriate cases. Such damages \u2018may be awarded for conduct that is outrageous, because of the defendant\u2019s evil motive or his reckless indifference to the rights of others.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ciccarelli </em>v. <em>School Dept. of Lowell, </em>70 Mass. App. Ct. at 795, quoting from <em>Dartt </em>v. <em>Browning-Ferris Indus., Inc. (Mass.), </em>427 Mass. 1, 17a (1998). \u201cAn award of punitive damages requires a determination of the defendant\u2019s intent or state of mind, determinations properly left to the jury, whose verdict should be sustained if it could \u2018reasonably have [been] arrived at . . . from any . . . evidence . . . presented.\u2019 \u201d <em>Haddad </em>v. <em>Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (No. 1), </em>455 Mass, at 107, quoting from <em>Dartt </em>v. <em>Browning-Ferris Indus., Inc. (Mass.), supra </em>at 16. Nonetheless, \u201cthe award of punitive damages cannot be left to the unguided discretion of the jury.\u201d <em>Bain </em>v. <em>Springfield, </em>424 Mass. 758, 769 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">Such a review of punitive damages is essential given that they implicate constitutional principles. As the Supreme Judicial Court stated in <em>Aleo </em>v. <em>SLB Toys USA, Inc., </em>466 Mass. 398, 412-413 (2013) (citations omitted),</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">\u201cThe due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution . . . prohibits the imposition of a \u2018 \u201cgrossly excessive\u201d punishment\u2019 on a tortfeasor. \u2018Elementary notions of fairness enshrined in our constitutional jurisprudence dictate that a person receive fair notice not only of the conduct that will subject him to punishment, but also of the severity of the penalty that a State may impose.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">Accordingly, \u201c[t]o the extent an award is grossly excessive, it furthers no legitimate purpose and constitutes an arbitrary deprivation of property.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 413, quoting from <em>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>538 U.S. 408, 417 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">In <em>Haddad </em>v. <em>Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (No. 1), </em>455 Mass, at 110-111 <em>(Haddad), </em>the Supreme Judicial Court articulated the standard for an award of punitive damages under G. L. c. 151B:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-9\">\u201cPunitive damages may be awarded only where the defendant\u2019s conduct is outrageous or egregious. Punitive damages are warranted where the conduct is so offensive that it justifies punishment and not merely compensation. In making an award of punitive damages, the fact finder <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>should determine that the award is needed to deter such behavior toward the class of which plaintiff is a member, or that the defendant\u2019s behavior is so egregious that it warrants public condemnation and punishment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">Whether a plaintiff has met this standard of \u201coutrageous or egregious\u201d conduct is to be measured by applying a number of nonexclusive factors set out in <em>Haddad, supra </em>at 111: (1) \u201cwhether there was a conscious or purposeful effort to demean or diminish the class of which the plaintiff is a part (or the plaintiff because he or she is a member of the class)\u201d; (2) \u201cwhether the defendant was aware that the discriminatory conduct would likely cause serious harm, or recklessly disregarded the likelihood that serious harm would arise\u201d; (3) \u201cthe actual harm to the plaintiff\u201d; (4) \u201cthe defendant\u2019s conduct after learning that the initial conduct would likely cause harm\u201d; and (5) \u201cthe duration of the wrongful conduct and any concealment of that conduct by the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">In her memorandum, the trial judge thoroughly addressed the <em>Haddad </em>factors and concluded, correctly in our view, that the evidence, even viewed most favorably to Kiely, did not show conduct by Teradyne that was so outrageous or egregious as to warrant public condemnation and punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">As an initial matter, we reject Kiely\u2019s argument that a showing on a single <em>Haddad </em>factor is sufficient to support an award of punitive damages. Such a position directly conflicts with the settled principle that \u201cmere liability\u201d is insufficient to sustain an award for punitive damages. <em>Id. </em>at 110. If a single factor, like factor three, actual harm to the plaintiff, <em>id. </em>at 111, was sufficient to uphold such an award, then punitive damages could be awarded in virtually every discrimination case in which a jury awards some compensatory damages. We also note that the judge considered not giving an instruction on punitive damages as she doubted whether the evidence presented at trial supported such an award. However, in an abundance of caution, the trial judge reasoned the better course was to submit the question to the jury to avoid the possibility that a reversal would require another jury trial. The judge wisely waited until after the close of evidence, the verdict, and the parties\u2019 postverdict briefing to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>correctly conclude upon further reflection that the award of punitive damages could not be sustained.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">As the judge noted, only one of the <em>Haddad </em>factors weighs in favor of Kiely. As to the first factor, the jury\u2019s rejection of Kiely\u2019s gender discrimination claim seriously undermines any suggestion that Teradyne\u2019s action in failing to rehire Kiely was part of a conscious or purposeful effort to demean females as a class (or to demean Kiely because of being female). Nevertheless, we note that the Supreme Judicial Court fashioned the <em>Haddad </em>standard \u201cspecifically for discrimination claims,\u201d 455 Mass, at 110, and therefore, this factor may be less relevant in a retaliation case such as this, where the question is whether Kiely was singled out for engaging in a protected activity, rather than being part of a protected class.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">Second, the jury could reasonably have concluded that Teradyne was aware or should have known that not rehiring Kiely would inflict serious harm (the second <em>Haddad </em>factor). Teradyne was aware that Kiely was seeking reemployment, as she inquired about open positions at least three times. Kiely also had spent her entire technical career at Teradyne and was grandfathered into generous benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">Although factor two favors Kiely, importantly, the jury found no actual harm (the third <em>Haddad </em>factor) in that they awarded no compensatory damages.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> See <em>Labonte </em>v. <em>Hutchins &amp; </em>Wheeler, 424 Mass. 813, 827 (1997) (\u201cWhere, as here, there is no cap on punitive damages, a judge or an appellate court must scrutinize the relationship between actual damages and the award of punitive damages\u201d). Contrary to Kiely\u2019s argument, there is nothing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>in the record to suggest that the jury were confused about the damages that they could award and how they should apportion them. Kiely\u2019s contention that the jury may have folded damages for the harm she suffered into their award of punitive damages is mere speculation. The jury instructions clearly described and delineated the damages \u2014 compensatory and punitive \u2014 available for their consideration; moreover, the special verdict form differentiated between the separate forms of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">Most significant is the lack of evidence as to <em>Haddad </em>factors four and five in that there was no evidence at trial that the defendant took any adverse action against Kiely beyond the retaliation itself. Kiely asserts that the jury\u2019s apparent disbelief of Fitton\u2019s testimony that he was unaware of Kiely\u2019s MCAD complaint at the time he made the rehiring decision, which is the apparent basis for the retaliation verdict,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> is also proof that Teradyne attempted to cover up its wrongdoing.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">However, the fact that the jury drew an inference against Fit-ton does not equate with positive evidence that he lied or that Teradyne orchestrated a cover-up. Since there is no affirmative evidence, beyond this inference, that the defendant orchestrated a cover-up of its wrongdoing, or that there were other aggravating factors beyond the retaliation itself, the jury\u2019s award of punitive damages cannot stand. See, e.g., <em>Dalrymple </em>v. <em>Winthrop, </em>50 Mass. App. Ct. 611, 621 (2000) (punitive damages warranted where defendant police chief who was \u201ccharged with the public duty to enforce the law equally [was] shown to have deliberately violated it for reprehensible reasons\u201d); <em>Ciccarelli </em>v. <em>School Dept. of Lowell, </em>70 Mass. App. Ct. at 796-797 (punitive damages upheld where there was affirmative evidence of attempted concealment of wrongdoing and where defendant had public duty to enforce law equally). This is especially true where, as mentioned above, the jury found no actual harm to Kiely. See <em>Aleo </em>v. <em>SLB Toys USA, Inc., </em>466 Mass, at 415, quoting from <em>BMW of N. America, Inc. </em>v. <em>Gore, </em>517 U.S. 559, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>580 (1996) (\u201cThe second and perhaps most commonly cited indicium of an unreasonable or excessive punitive damages award is its ratio to the actual harm inflicted on the plaintiff\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">Therefore, this case is in contrast to those cases where there was <em>affirmative </em>evidence of an attempted concealment of wrongful conduct. For example, in <em>Ciccarelli </em>v. <em>School Dept. of Lowell, </em>70 Mass. App. Ct. at 798, this court upheld an award of punitive damages where the jury could have found that a deputy superintendent\u2019s testimony was false <em>and </em>was designed to facilitate a cover-up of her wrongdoing. In that case, the city\u2019s deputy superintendent of personnel, Flanagan, made the decision not to rehire the plaintiff, Ciccarelli, four days after learning that Ciccarelli appeared on the witness list on behalf of a coworker, Kealy, in Kealy\u2019s MCAD case against the school district. <em>Id. </em>at 789-790, 796. Flanagan claimed her reason for failing to rehire Ciccarelli was that Ciccarelli had not completed coursework toward advanced certification, despite the fact that this was the first criticism of Ciccarelli\u2019s progress and she still had three years to complete the coursework. <em>Id. </em>at 789-790. Significantly, Flanagan was an active participant in the Kealy case and was even present at the defense table when Ciccarelli testified at Kealy\u2019s MCAD hearing in 1997. <em>Id. </em>at 794 &amp; n.3. However, at trial in Ciccarelli\u2019s court case, Flanagan testified that, until her deposition in 2002, she was unaware that Ciccarelli had testified on Kealy\u2019s behalf. <em>Id. </em>at 790-791. Therefore, in <em>Ciccarelli, </em>there was affirmative evidence that Flanagan not only lied on the stand about her recollection of Ciccarelli\u2019s role in the MCAD case, but also fabricated an excuse for her wrongful conduct in failing to rehire Ciccarelli.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> See <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Ochs, </em>817 F.2d 920, 928 (1st Cir. 1987) (\u201c[A] factfinder might infer that the stark clash could not have resulted from innocent misrecollection, and that its <em>intentional </em>quality intensified any need the jury may have found for punishment and deterrence\u201d). Likewise, in <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Ochs, supra </em>at 927-928, the court upheld <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>an award of punitive damages where the defendant police officers argued that the plaintiff\u2019s testimony against them was deliberately false and they provided a highly suspect police report to support their allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">By contrast, in this case, the defendant\u2019s conduct after learning that its failure to rehire Kiely would likely cause harm, and whether the defendant purposely concealed its wrongful conduct, were, as the judge noted, \u201cleft to the realm of speculation as these issues were not addressed directly or indirectly by the evidence at trial.\u201d As the Supreme Judicial Court made clear in Haddad, 455 Mass, at 110, \u201c[t]o sustain an award of punitive damages under G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4, a finding of intentional discrimination alone is not sufficient.\u201d Likewise here, a finding of retaliation alone is insufficient to support the jury\u2019s award of $1.1 million in punitive damages; \u201c[a]n award of punitive damages requires a heightened finding beyond mere liability and also beyond a knowing violation of the statute.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">We are also unpersuaded by Kiely\u2019s argument that the judge did not consider all of the defendant\u2019s underlying retaliatory conduct. The judge examined all the evidence relating to the retaliation and, after careful review of relevant case law, correctly determined that \u201cthe retaliation in this case, while reprehensible, simply does not meet the threshold for an award of punitive damages.\u201d For example, in <em>Clifton </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Authy., </em>445 Mass. 611, 613-614, 622, 624 (2005), the Supreme Judicial Court concluded that an award of punitive damages would be appropriate where the jury could have found that the African-American plaintiff was subject to a pattern of egregious racial harassment and retaliation by both his supervisor and coworkers, who \u201cshot bottle rockets at him, turned the lights off when he used the bathroom, sprayed water at him through fire hoses, dropped firecrackers near him, set water boobytraps that would fall on him when he opened his office door, and painted Tag bait\u2019 and \u2018Sanford and Son\u2019 on his locker,\u201d among other things.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We recognize that \u201c [determining what conduct rises to the level at which an award of punitive dam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>ages is appropriate is a difficult task, but the evidence shows that the actions at issue in this case do not.\u201d <em>McMillan </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Soc. for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, </em>140 F.3d 288, 307 (1st Cir. 1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">b. <em>Kiely\u2019s gender discrimination claim. </em>Second, Kiely contends that her gender discrimination claim must be remanded for a new trial because the judge erred in (1) failing to instruct the jury on Kiely\u2019s termination claim, separate and apart from the rehire claim, and (2) failing to give a statistical evidence jury instruction. We discern no error. The trial judge has wide discretion in framing the language used in jury instructions. <em>General Dynamics Corp. </em>v. <em>Federal Pac. Elec. Co., </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. 677, 684 (1985). \u201c[A] good objection to a charge \u2018will lie only if a critical issue was not dealt with at all or was dealt with erroneously as a matter of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid., </em>quoting from <em>Torre </em>v. <em>Harris-Seybold Co., </em>9 Mass. App. Ct. 660, 678-679 (1980). An appellate court must review the charge as a whole and in the context of the evidence. See <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Boston Redev. Authy., </em>366 Mass. 588, 591-592 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">As the trial judge noted, Kiely\u2019s case centered on the defendant\u2019s decision not to rehire her, in the context of its having laid off her and the two males from GCS and then rehiring the males. Kiely did not claim, and there was no evidence to warrant a trial on a claim, that her termination, by itself, was discriminatory. Indeed, Kiely survived a series of layoffs from 2000 to 2006 until she was one of the last three remaining GCS test technicians at Teradyne, and she was not terminated until the unit was shut down. In making this argument, Kiely seems to rely on the fact that a motion judge had denied Teradyne\u2019s motion for summary judgment as to Kiely\u2019s termination claim. However, the judge only did this because to separate Kiely\u2019s termination claim and her failure to rehire claim \u201cwould elevate form over substance.\u201d Thus, the motion judge recognized that \u201cthe facility closure, termination of the employees, and the rehiring of the two male technicians must logically be considered together.\u201d Nevertheless, the motion judge stressed that Kiely\u2019s termination, considered by itself without reference to the failure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>to rehire, cannot support a discrimination claim. This correctly aligns with the trial judge\u2019s decision not to give a separate instruction on termination; we therefore discern no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">Likewise, the trial judge\u2019s decision to not instruct the jury regarding Kiely\u2019s statistical evidence was soundly within her discretion and consistent with the record evidence. As the judge recognized, Kiely \u201cwas given an opportunity to put on expert testimony to explain the significance of the statistics and declined to do so.\u201d Additionally, both the motion judge at summary judgment and the trial judge questioned the reliability of Kiely\u2019s statistical evidence in demonstrating a general pattern of discrimination. See <em>Rathbun </em>v. <em>Autozone, Inc., </em>361 F.3d 62, 79-80 (1st Cir. 2004) (requiring statistical evidence to \u201ccross a threshold of dependability\u201d to be probative of discriminatory intent).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">c. <em>Teradyne\u2019s motion for judgment n.o.v. </em>We discern no error in the judge\u2019s decision to deny the defendant\u2019s motion for judgment n.o.v. as to Kiely\u2019s retaliation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">Here, although the vast majority of evidence presented at trial concerned Kiely\u2019s discrimination claim rather than her retaliation claim, and the sufficiency of evidence to support the jury\u2019s finding of retaliation was a close question, Kiely established enough of a \u201ctoe-hold\u201d to retain her verdict. While the hiring manager, Fitton, testified that he was not told of Kiely\u2019s protected activity, i.e., the filing of the MCAD complaint, at the time he made the rehiring decision, the jury could have reasonably inferred from the HR manager\u2019s unusual instruction to document this hiring process that Fitton, an experienced manager, understood the reason for this departure and concluded it was because of Kiely\u2019s protected conduct. As the trial judge noted, \u201c [although not compelling by any means, the directive to document the hiring process could have tipped the balance ever so slightly in the minds of the jurors who were instructed to determine if Fitton was aware of the MCAD charge at the time of his hiring decision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b474-8\">d. <em>Kiely\u2019s motion for attorney\u2019s fees under G. L. c. 15IB, \u00a7 9. </em>Given our decision to uphold the judge\u2019s order to vacate the award of punitive damages and to allow the verdict on retaliation to stand, we must decide whether G. L. c. 15IB, \u00a7 9, requires an award of attorney\u2019s fees where there is a verdict of liability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>for discrimination or retaliation, but no damages are awarded. This appears to be a question of first impression. Kiely contends that the plain language of \u00a7 9 permits recovery of fees based solely upon a \u201cfinding\u201d of liability. This section states: \u201cIf the court finds for the petitioner it shall, in addition to any other relief and irrespective of the amount in controversy, award the petitioner reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs unless special circumstances would render such an award unjust.\u201d G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 9, as amended by St. 1974, c. 478. Although in answering the special verdict form, the jury may have \u201cfound\u201d for the plaintiff on the retaliation count, the defendant relies on other limiting language in the statute. By analogizing to other statutes and interpretations, the defendant suggests that the statute\u2019s use of the phrase \u201cin addition to any other relief\u201d undermines Kiely\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">\u201cWhere possible, we seek to harmonize statutory provisions, recognizing that the Legislature did not intend one provision of a statute to contradict another.\u201d <em>Birchall, petitioner, </em>454 Mass. 837, 849 (2009). Importantly, as the defendant notes, \u00a7 9 states the court shall award attorney\u2019s fees <em>\u201cin addition </em>to any other relief\u201d (emphasis added). In <em>Jet Line Servs., Inc. </em>v. <em>American Employers Ins. Co., </em>404 Mass. 706, 708-709 (1989) <em>(Jet Line), </em>the Supreme Judicial Court confronted a situation similar to this case: a motion for attorney\u2019s fees under the analogous attorney\u2019s fees provision of G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> that was also premised on a finding for the plaintiff where there was no relief given. There, the court stated that \u201cthe reference [in G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11,] to an award \u2018in addition to other relief\u2019 indicates that relief solely in the form of attorneys\u2019 fees may not be had.\u201d <em>Jet Line, supra </em>at 718. See <em>Lord </em>v. <em>Commercial Union Ins. Co., </em>60 Mass. App. Ct. 309, 324-325 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">Kiely, however, contends that the statutory differences between G. L. cc. 93A and 15 IB require us to depart from <em>Jet Line </em>in interpreting G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 9. She asserts that G. L. c. 93A is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>narrowly focused on recovery for a specific type of loss in that a claim under G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11, requires a \u201closs of money or property, real or personal.\u201d <em>Id., </em>inserted by St. 1972, c. 614, \u00a7 2. Kiely argues that by contrast, G. L. c. 15 IB has a broad remedial purpose. See G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 9, as appearing in St. 2002, c. 223, \u00a7 2 (G. L. c. 151B to be \u201cconstrued liberally for the accomplishment of its purposes\u201d). See also <em>Gasior </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Gen. Hosp., </em>446 Mass. 645, 654 (2006) (\u201c[T]he broad remedial purposes of G. L. c. 15 IB mandate[] that the provision concerning remedies available ... be construed liberally for the accomplishment of the statute\u2019s purposes\u201d); <em>Psy-Ed Corp. </em>v. <em>Klein, </em>459 Mass. 697, 708 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">We conclude that Kiely\u2019s attempts to differentiate G. L. cc. 93A and 15IB so as to render the reasoning in <em>Jet Line </em>inapplicable to the present case are unpersuasive. First, <em>Jet Line </em>expressly rejected Kiely\u2019s reading of G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11, as narrowly tailored to award fees only if the claimant sustained a loss of money or property due to the defendant\u2019s unfair or deceptive acts or practice. In fact, the court stated that \u00a7 11 \u201csays nothing explicitly about proof of a loss of money or property as a condition to a right to recover attorneys\u2019 fees.\u201d <em>Jet Line, </em>404 Mass, at 718. Moreover, the Supreme Judicial Court has previously looked to cases interpreting G. L. c. 93A for guidance in deciding issues under G. L. c. 15IB, \u00a7 9. For example, on the separate issue of how attorney\u2019s fees are to be properly calculated under G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 9, the Supreme Judicial Court, in <em>Fontaine </em>v. <em>Ebtec Corp., </em>415 Mass. 309, 324-325 (1993), looked to the \u201canalogous\u201d case law addressing the same issue under G. L. c. 93A. Moreover, the underlying policies of the fee-shifting provisions in both G. L. c. 93A and G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 9, are the same: to encourage attorneys to represent plaintiffs with such claims, where otherwise such actions \u201care not likely to pay for themselves, but are nevertheless desirable because they vindicate important rights.\u201d <em>Stratos </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Welfare, </em>387 Mass. 312, 323 (1982). See <em>Fontaine </em>v. <em>Ebtec Corp., supra </em>at 326.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">Next, Kiely argues that even if we apply the reasoning in <em>Jet Line </em>to this case, she is still entitled to attorney\u2019s fees. She asserts that although the <em>Jet Line </em>court fashioned a rule that dam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>ages usually must be found in order to trigger fee shifting, <em>Jet Line </em>still allows for an award of fees upon a showing of \u201cadverse effect.\u201d Specifically, the <em>Jet Line </em>court stated that \u201ca plaintiff suing under [G. L. c. 93A,] \u00a7 11, . . . cannot recover attorneys\u2019 fees for merely identifying an unfair or deceptive act or practice. Under \u00a7 11, that unfair or deceptive conduct must have had some <em>adverse effect </em>upon the plaintiff, even if it is not quantifiable in dollars\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Jet Line, </em>404 Mass, at 718. Because a plaintiff must prove an adverse employment action to prove retaliation, see <em>Mole </em>v. <em>University of Mass., </em>442 Mass. 582, 591-592 (2004), Kiely reasons that she has sufficiently shown a requisite \u201cadverse effect\u201d under <em>Jet Line </em>to be entitled to attorney\u2019s fees under G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">Such language, however, does not entitle Kiely to attorney\u2019s fees when she has been denied any form of relief. In stating that the \u201cunfair or deceptive conduct must have had some adverse effect upon the plaintiff\u201d to sustain an award of attorney\u2019s fees, the <em>Jet Line </em>court sought to reconcile two previous Appeals Court decisions, <em>Levy </em>v. <em>Bendetson, </em>6 Mass. App. Ct. 558 (1978), and <em>Shapiro </em>v. <em>Public Serv. Mut. Ins. Co., </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 648 (1985). In <em>Levy, supra </em>at 566-567, we reversed an award of attorney\u2019s fees where the plaintiff failed to prove any damages under G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11. We reasoned that \u201c[wjhere, as here, a single plaintiff is seeking damages as an individual on his own behalf and has been denied any relief under \u00a7 11, it would indeed be anomalous to grant him attorneys\u2019 fees under that section.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">By contrast, in <em>Shapiro, </em>we upheld a grant of attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 11 where \u201cthe plaintiff appeared to have lost the use of money but offered no proof of the dollar amount of that loss.\u201d <em>Jet Line, </em>404 Mass, at 718. Unlike the party in <em>Levy, </em>who was unable to show proof of damages, the plaintiff in <em>Shapiro </em>did suffer actual damages but \u201coffered no evidence to show the amount of that loss.\u201d <em>Shapiro, supra </em>at 657. In <em>Shapiro, </em>the plaintiff was required to clean up oil that leaked from his underground fuel tank. <em>Id. </em>at 649. However, the defendant insurer, Public Service, disclaimed coverage under the pollution exclusion clause of the policy. <em>Ibid. </em>Shapiro then sought recovery on the policy and recovery under G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11, \u201cbased upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>the allegation that Public Service failed to effectuate a prompt settlement of his claim when liability was reasonably clear.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 656. To prove his c. 93A claim, Shapiro sought documents as to how Public Service addressed similar claims over the previous five years. <em>Ibid. </em>Public Service, however, failed to provide these documents, and thereafter, a motion judge ordered that the documents be produced. <em>Ibid. </em>After Public Service again failed to produce the documents pursuant to the discovery order, another judge sanctioned Public Service by entering a finding that its \u201cfailure to effectuate prompt, fair and equitable settlement when liability was reasonably clear was wilful.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The discovery sanction, in conjunction with the finding of coverage under the policy, established that Public Service had wilfully committed an unfair or deceptive act or practice in violation of G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 2. Acting under G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11, the trial judge awarded damages equal to the damages awarded on the policy (costs and expenses of spill clean-up), as well as attorney\u2019s fees. <em>Id. </em>at 656-657. However, we held the judge erred in awarding Shapiro damages on his c. 93A claim. We reasoned that Shapiro was not entitled to count the amount due to him under the policy, which was the basis of his award under the first count of his complaint, as the basis for an award under G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11. <em>Id. </em>at 657, citing <em>DiMarzo </em>v. <em>American Mut. Ins. Co., </em>389 Mass. 85, 101-102 (1983). Nonetheless, we upheld the award of attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 11. <em>Id. </em>at 657, 660. In <em>Jet Line, </em>404 Mass, at 718, the Supreme Judicial Court clarified that \u201c[t]he <em>Shapiro </em>case reached the proper result on its facts because the defendant\u2019s violation of G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 2, caused a loss of money that, on proper proof of the amount, would have entitled the plaintiff to relief and the award of attorneys\u2019 fees was within the statute\u2019s purpose.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">Arguably, <em>Shapiro, supra </em>at 660, is unique in that \u201cthe unfair act [under G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 2,] [was] established by sanction rather than evidence.\u201d Still, the <em>Jet Line </em>court concluded that <em>Shapiro </em>reached the \u201cproper result\u201d because the sanction presupposed that the plaintiff had been harmed by the defendant\u2019s wilful violation of G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 2. Therefore, unlike in <em>Levy </em>where the plaintiff was found to have suffered no harm, harm in <em>Shapiro </em>was proven by the sanction, and only the amount of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>that harm was left in doubt. In effect, the sanction in <em>Shapiro </em>was akin to an injunction in that it was a nonmonetary response to harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">Accordingly, in the c. 93A context, courts have also upheld an award of attorney\u2019s fees where a plaintiff received only injunctive relief, but no monetary damages, as an \u201cadverse effect\u201d under <em>Jet Line. </em>See <em>Jillian\u2019s Billiard Club of America, Inc. </em>v. <em>Beloff Billiards, Inc., </em>35 Mass. App. Ct. 372, 377 (1993) (\u201cThe plaintiffs obtained injunctive relief and were also successful in proving that the defendants violated G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 2. The award was warranted. The violation \u2018had some adverse effect upon the plaintiff[s], even if it [was] not quantified] in dollars,\u2019 \u201d quoting from <em>Jet Line, </em>404 Mass, at 718); <em>Advanced Sys. Consultants Ltd. </em>v. <em>Engineering Planning &amp; Mgmt., Inc., </em>899 F. Supp. 832, 833-834 (D. Mass. 1995). By contrast, in <em>SMS Financial V, LLC </em>v. <em>Conti, </em>68 Mass. App. Ct. 738, 748 (2007), this court determined that an award of a preliminary injunction alone cannot support an award of attorney\u2019s fees under G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11. We reasoned that a preliminary injunction, meant to preserve the status quo, cannot provide a basis for attorney\u2019s fees where the case was ultimately resolved against the plaintiff. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">Thus, the \u201cadverse effect\u201d language of <em>Jet Line, </em>in context, clarifies that a party need not necessarily receive monetary relief to be entitled to attorney\u2019s fees under G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11; a form of nonmonetary relief is sufficient. As this court noted in <em>Martha\u2019s Vineyard Auto Village, Inc. </em>v. <em>Newman, </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. 363, 369 (1991), the important distinction is between \u201cactual but not clearly measurable damages or loss, contrasted with no actual damage or loss.\u201d Actual but not clearly measurable damages or loss, like injunctive relief, would entitle a party to attorney\u2019s fees. By contrast, an absence of actual damages or loss would not. Kiely clearly falls into the latter category. Kiely\u2019s expert testified that her back pay losses were $213,732 and her front pay losses were $700,292.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The jury, however, expressly rejected this testimony by awarding Kiely zero compensatory damages. As discussed above, the jury\u2019s award of punitive dam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>ages also was rightfully vacated by the trial judge. Therefore, Kiely received no form of relief, damages, an injunction, or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">Significantly, putting aside the perhaps esoteric distinctions between <em>Shapiro </em>and <em>Levy </em>in the c. 93A context, to award attorney\u2019s fees absent any form of recovery is contrary to the underlying policies of G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 9, see <em>Fontaine </em>v. <em>Ebtec Corp., </em>415 Mass, at 326 (\u201c[General Laws c. 151B, \u00a7 9,] is not designed to provide a windfall recovery of fees\u201d), and the great weight of authority that suggests a party must recover in some form to be entitled to attorney\u2019s fees.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> See <em>Lord </em>v. <em>Commercial Union Ins. Co., </em>60 Mass. App. Ct. at 325. See also <em>Gasior </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Gen. Hosp., </em>446 Mass, at 654 n.13 (\u201cIf he prevails on his discrimination claim, [the plaintiff] would be entitled to all of the remedies available to a prevailing plaintiff under G. L. c. 151B\u201d); <em>Ciccarelli </em>v. <em>School Dept. of Lowell, </em>70 Mass. App. Ct. at 799 (\u201cAs we conclude that [the plaintiff] is the prevailing party, we affirm the trial judge\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees\u201d); <em>Diaz </em>v. <em>Jiten Hotel Mgmt. Inc., </em>704 F.3d 150, 153 (1st Cir. 2012) (\u201cBecause she was a prevailing party on her state law age discrimination claim, [the plaintiff] was entitled to attorney\u2019s fees under [G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 9]\u201d). We also decline to engage in impermissible appellate fact finding by looking beyond the jury verdict to speculate whether Kiely suffered actual, but not clearly measurable, harm. The jury awarded Kiely zero compensatory damages. The award of punitive damages was rightfully vacated. Kiely has obtained no relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">Consequently, we conclude that a finding of retaliation alone, without <em>any </em>form of relief or recovery, cannot support an award of attorney\u2019s fees under G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 9. Cf. <em>Jet Line, </em>404 Mass, at 718 (\u201cUnder [G. L. c. 93A,] \u00a7 11, a plaintiff must be entitled to relief in some other respect in order to be entitled to an award of attorneys\u2019 fees\u201d). The judge correctly declined to award attorney\u2019s fees to Kiely.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">3. <em>Conclusion. </em>The judgment, as modified by the order vacating the award of punitive damages, is affirmed.
