McMahon, </em>Assistant District Attorney, for the Commonwealth.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b117-12\"><em>Deborah Bates Riordan </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b117-13\">Brown, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aqs\">After a jury trial in the Superior Court, the defendant was convicted of a single count of assault and battery and was acquitted of extortion by threats, improper use of a credit card, and unarmed robbery. The day after the trial concluded, the defendant moved to set aside the jury\u2019s guilty verdict; the motion was denied. The defendant later moved for reconsideration, and after a nonevidentiary hearing, the trial judge allowed the motion in a written memorandum of decision. The Commonwealth has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>The charges arose from an incident that occurred after the victim had consensual sex with the defendant at the defendant\u2019s apartment. Relevant to the single count on which the defendant was convicted, the Commonwealth proffered evidence that showed, after the sex act, at about 4:00 p.m., the victim, at the defendant\u2019s request, drove him to a nearby Friendly\u2019s Restaurant (Friendly\u2019s), where a disagreement erupted in the parking lot. According to the victim, the defendant demanded payment for the sexual encounter, and when the victim refused, the defendant grabbed the registration documents and other paperwork from the glove compartment of the victim\u2019s vehicle. When the victim tried to stop him, the defendant struck him multiple times in the head, breaking the victim\u2019s tooth and cutting his ear. The victim described a series of subsequent events that were the foundation for the additional charges of which the defendant was acquitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">The bill of particulars the Commonwealth provided to the defendant before trial mirrored this version of events as well as the evidence presented to the grand jury. In relation to the assault and battery charge, the document stated that it occurred at \u201cFriendly\u2019s on Sumner Avenue\u201d at \u201c[approximately 2:30-5:00 p.m.\u201d and that \u201c[t]he defendant punched [the victim] in the mouth.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">The defendant\u2019s testimony at trial, however, conflicted with portions of these particulars. He denied going to Friendly\u2019s with the victim. He testified that after the two men engaged in sex, he briefly left his apartment with permission to use the victim\u2019s automated teller machine (ATM) card, and returned shortly before 5:00 p.m. with cash and alcohol. The defendant testified that when he entered his apartment, he saw the victim appear to be downloading child pornography onto the defendant\u2019s laptop computer, and he \u201cwent off.\u201d He described hitting the victim with his hands and probably his fists, as well as with a bottle of alcohol and a cellular telephone. As he was being struck, the victim grabbed his clothes and fled the apartment, with the defendant following behind him, throwing things at him as he made his way out of the building.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\"><em>Motion to set aside the verdict. </em>The trial judge focused on the bill of particulars and determined that it limited the scope of the indictment to the incident in the Friendly\u2019s parking lot. Because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>the jury acquitted the defendant of all the charges except the offense to which he admitted, the judge opined that since there were two incidents, the jury \u201cvery likely convicted [the defendant] of a crime for which he had not been indicted\u201d \u2014 the assault and battery in the defendant\u2019s apartment, rather than the assault and battery in the Friendly\u2019s parking lot \u2014 and set aside the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>On appeal the Commonwealth argues that there was a single assault and, as the disputed evidence relates solely to the location of that assault, reversal is not warranted because location is not material to any element of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">\u201cIn general, a crime must be proved as charged and must be charged as proved. But a defendant is not to be acquitted on the ground of variance between the allegations and proof if the essential elements of the crime are correctly stated, unless he is thereby prejudiced in his defense. G. L. c. 277, \u00a7 35.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Geisler, </em>14 Mass. App. Ct. 268, 275 (1982), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grasso, </em>375 Mass. 138, 139 91978).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">Here, the indictment correctly recited the essential elements of the crime, stating the defendant \u201cdid assault and beat\u201d the victim. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burke, </em>390 Mass. 480, 482 (1983), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Farrell, </em>322 Mass. 606, 620 (1948) (harmful battery is \u201c[a]ny touching \u2018with such violence that bodily harm is likely to result\u2019 \u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Eberhart, </em>461 Mass. 809, 818 (2012). The crime of assault and battery, however, has \u201cno essential connection with the place in which it is committed,\u201d and for that reason, the place where it occurred need not be alleged and is not an essential element of the crime the Commonwealth must prove. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Geisler, </em>14 Mass. App. Ct. at 276, quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Parotta, </em>316 Mass. 307, 309 (1944). G. L. c. 277, \u00a7 20. That the crime may have occurred at the defendant\u2019s apartment rather than in the Friendly\u2019s parking lot is not material to proof of the crime. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Roby, </em>462 Mass. 398, 402-404 (2012) (instruction that changed location of rape from defendant\u2019s motor vehicle, alleged in indictment, to bedroom was not material and did not prejudice defendant). Simply because there is a variance between the bill of particulars and the evidence introduced at trial, particularly evidence related <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>to a collateral matter, the defendant is not entitled to relief unless he can show \u201cthat the bill of particulars failed to provide [him] with \u2018notice to prepare his defense.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pillai, </em>445 Mass. 175, 188 (2005), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Amirault, </em>404 Mass. 221, 234 (1989). The defendant has made no such showing.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">We further note that the record does not support the trial judge\u2019s conclusion that there were two separate incidents merely because the testimony diverged as to the location of the crime. There was no dispute at trial that after the victim and defendant engaged in consensual sex, an altercation arose that resulted in the defendant\u2019s striking the victim with his hands, sometime between 4:00 p.m. and 5:00 p.m. In addition, regardless of which version is considered, both versions describe at least an incident of assault and battery during the requisite time frame. The discrepancies relate only to such peripheral factors as the number of times the defendant struck the victim and the location of the offense. These discrepancies have no connection to the essential elements of the crime and do not convert a single incident into distinct events that must be charged and proved separately. Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barbosa, </em>421 Mass. 547, 551 (1995) (Commonwealth provided the grand jury with evidence outlining the essential elements of two separate drug deals but they returned only one indictment, creating \u201cthe very real possibility that the defendant was convicted of a crime for which he was not indicted\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pearson, </em>77 Mass. App. Ct. 95, 100-101 (2010) (grand jury mistakenly indicted defendant, rather than codefendant, for specific illegal transaction and indictment could not be amended to reflect correct transaction that occurred minutes later because defendant had not been indicted for that later, separate and additional incident). Here, the prosecutor correctly understood the posture of the case when she specifically argued to the jury that the defendant \u201cadmits an assault and battery. He just doesn\u2019t admit that it didn\u2019t happen at his house.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">In short, the defendant was properly convicted. To reach any other result on this record would create the untenable path by which a defendant could invalidate an indictment by admitting the essential elements of the offense but contradicting a non<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>essential factor consistently presented by the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence, such as the location where it occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">The order allowing the defendant\u2019s motion to set aside the verdict is reversed. The jury verdict and the judgment shall be reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
