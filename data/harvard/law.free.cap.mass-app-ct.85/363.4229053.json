At issue on appeal is the interpretation of language contained in a temporary order that was in effect for a two-year period during the parties\u2019 divorce proceedings requiring the husband to pay the wife \u201ca sum equal to one-third of his year end distribution after taxes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b395-14\"><em>Background. </em>The parties were married for thirty-one years, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>although they lived separately during the last two of those years. The husband is a partner in a large law firm; the wife does not work outside the home. In 2007, the wife filed a complaint for divorce on the ground of irretrievable breakdown of the marriage. On October 20, 2008, the court entered the temporary order here in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">We review the husband\u2019s compensation structure as it is relevant to the parties\u2019 arguments on appeal. The husband\u2019s approximate annual compensation in 2008 was $970,000.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The husband\u2019s annual compensation includes the following types of draws or distributions: (1) a $10,000 monthly draw; (2) three \u201ctax draws\u201d in the amount of approximately $110,000 paid in April, June, and September; and (3) a year-end distribution that is received in January of the following year.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>The husband\u2019s year-end distributions for 2008 and 2009 \u2014 the two years pertinent to the dispute \u2014 were $245,023 and $249,934, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\"><em>The first complaint for contempt. </em>In January, 2009, the husband received his 2008 year-end distribution. In July, 2009, the wife filed a complaint for contempt asserting that the husband had failed to pay one-third of his 2008 year-end distribution as directed by the court\u2019s temporary order. The contempt action was consolidated with the divorce trial. Following a consolidated trial, the court found the husband not guilty of contempt. Specifically, in her findings of fact and rationale dated September 7, 2010, the judge found that the husband had applied an appropriate combined (Federal and State) tax rate for 2008 of 40.3 percent and that \u201c[ajfter calculation of his State and Federal tax liability, [the hjusband complied with said order by paying $61,000.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\"><em>The second complaint for contempt. </em>In January, 2010, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>husband received his year-end distribution for 2009 in the amount of $249,934. The husband utilized the same tax rate he had applied twelve months earlier to his 2008 year-end distribution and, again, paid the wife one-third of the resulting after-tax amount. On March 12, 2010, the wife filed a second complaint for contempt alleging that the husband improperly calculated her share of the 2009 year-end distribution. A hearing was held on April 26, 2010, before the same judge of the Probate and Family Court. Following the hearing, in a judgment dated January 17, 2012, the judge found the husband in contempt and ordered him to pay the wife an additional $34,331.37 \u25a0\u2014 an amount equal to one-third of his entire year-end distribution (i.e., without application of the tax rate) \u2014 along with attorney\u2019s fees and interest at the statutory rate of 12 percent. The husband filed this timely appeal from the judgment of contempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>\u201c[I]n order to find a defendant in civil contempt there must be a clear and unequivocal command and an equally clear and undoubted disobedience.\u201d <em>Larson </em>v. <em>Larson, </em>28 Mass. App. Ct. 338, 340 (1990) <em>(Larson), </em>citing <em>Nickerson </em>v. <em>Dowd, </em>342 Mass. 462, 464 (1961). We conclude that the court\u2019s October 20, 2008, temporary order requiring payment of \u201cone-third\u201d of the husband\u2019s year-end distribution \u201cafter taxes\u201d was a \u201cclear and unequivocal command\u201d of the sort required to support a complaint for contempt. It provided the husband with \u201cadequate notice of the required . . . activity.\u201d <em>Lynch </em>v. <em>Police Commr. of Boston, </em>51 Mass. App. Ct. 772, 776 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">When a term is not defined by case law, statute, or agreement, we look to its ordinary usage. <em>Sisson </em>v. <em>Lhowe, </em>460 Mass. 705, 709 (2011). \u201cAfter tax\u201d is commonly understood to be the sum remaining after taxes have been calculated. It refers to an amount net of tax obligations.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We reject the suggestion that the obligation to pay a portion of the husband\u2019s compensation \u201cafter taxes\u201d refers to timing and can vary depending on whether taxes attributable to that specific compensation have already been paid or remain outstanding.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">The judgment that the husband was in contempt with respect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>to his 2009 year-end distribution, however, is apparently based in part on the finding that the husband failed to calculate the correct \u201cafter tax\u201d amount of his distribution because he had previously paid estimated taxes on a quarterly basis during calendar year 2009 in anticipation of the tax obligation that would be incurred when he received the year-end distribution.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This was error, insofar as the \u201cclear and unequivocal\u201d command to pay an \u201cafter tax\u201d amount was not violated on this basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">The wife asserts that the judgment should be upheld, albeit on a different basis. She asserts that evidence in the record demonstrates that the husband overstated his tax rate, and did so in both years covered by the temporary order.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This could support a judgment of contempt, assuming that there were a finding of a \u201cclear and undoubted disobedience\u201d that reduced the amount due to the wife under the temporary order.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Even were we to credit, for purposes of our analysis, the wife\u2019s assertions that husband used an incorrect tax rate, we would be unable to uphold the contempt judgment on this record.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">Notably absent from the findings is any reference to \u201cclear and convincing evidence of disobedience\u201d by the husband of the terms of the temporary order. <em>Birchall, petitioner, </em>454 Mass. 837, 839 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">With respect to 2008, the husband first mistakenly overpaid, not underpaid, the wife. See note 3, <em>supra. </em>And, as stated, for that year the judge found that the \u201c[hjusband\u2019s combined liability for [Fjederal and [Sjtate taxes is 40.3 [percent].\u201d Accordingly, to the extent the temporary order was interpreted by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>the judge, its \u201cclear and unequivocal\u201d command was deemed satisfied by the use of that rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">Second, it is undisputed that the husband used the same tax rate and the identical method to calculate the wife\u2019s share of his year-end distributions in 2009 as in 2008. It is of course possible that the husband\u2019s tax rate was reduced by deductions, carried-forward losses, or some other mechanism that applied only in 2009, notwithstanding his almost identical level of annual earned compensation. There is however no finding to that effect, and no evidence in the record to support such a finding. Instead, the judge pointed to estimated quarterly tax payments paid during the year, and concluded that these should be employed to deem the entire year-end distribution \u201cafter taxes,\u201d hence subject to a zero percent rate. As stated above, this was error. See note 5, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">The wife\u2019s assertion that the husband misstated his rate in both years is unavailing here, as the dismissal of her first complaint for contempt and the finding that 40.3 percent was the correct rate in 2008 remains a ruling in the case. Absent a valid finding that distinguishes the two years, we conclude that this record fails to establish clear disobedience in 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">We recognize that our cases do not require a clear showing of actual intent to disobey a court order to support a judgment of civil contempt. See <em>O\u2019Connell </em>v. <em>Greenwood, </em>59 Mass. App. Ct. 147, 150-151 &amp; n.3 (2003) (recognizing that the question of the degree of intent that must be shown to support a judgment of civil contempt is unsettled). See also <em>United Factory Outlet, Inc. </em>v. <em>Jay\u2019s Stores, Inc., </em>361 Mass. 35, 36-39 (1972) (declining to address cases treating wilful disobedience as an essential element of a civil contempt claim against an individual).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> However, we conclude that this record \u2014 containing contrary orders in two successive years, without any supportable finding to distinguish them, coupled with the erroneous reliance on the timing of quarterly payments \u2014 cannot properly support a deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>mination of \u201cclear and undoubted disobedience.\u201d <em>Larson, </em>28 Mass. App. Ct. at 340.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">\n<em>Judgment of contempt dated January 17, 2012, reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b396-8\">The record suggests that the 2008 compensation level was generally typical of the surrounding years.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b396-9\">The record indicates that the husband also receives \u201cincentive draws,\u201d which may be paid at any time and are not guaranteed. These incentive draws are not at issue on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b396-10\">After application of the 40.3 percent rate to the gross amount paid in the 2008 year-end distribution, $245,023, one-third of the resulting net, \u201cafter tax\u201d amount of $146,278.74 was actually $49,000. The overpayment of $12,000 was acknowledged by the judge and credited against the husband\u2019s use of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>marital assets in the divorce judgment. The overpayment is not at issue in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b397-10\">The wife\u2019s counsel appropriately asserted this definition at oral argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b398-8\">The judgment states: \u201c[The husband] pays quarterly taxes which anticipates [sz'c] his year-end distribution, so the [c]curt finds that [the husband\u2019s] calculation of [the wife\u2019s] share is wrong.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b398-9\">In this context we note that the judgment of contempt is not definitive, and makes alternative findings: \u201cFrom the evidence at the contempt hearing, it appears to this [c]curt that the [husband] has either twice deducted taxes from his year end distribution, or calculated the wrong tax rate.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b398-10\">On appeal, the wife points to the husband\u2019s 2008 Federal tax return, and a 2009 financial statement included in the record appendix, to argue that the husband overstated his combined Federal and State rate to the wife\u2019s detriment. We do not agree that an inference can be drawn with respect to 2009, as the financial statement merely sets forth \u201cwithholding/estimated payments\u201d rather than the actual tax liability.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b399-8\">The term \u201cdisobedience\u201d can include, but does not depend upon, a concept of wilfulness.
