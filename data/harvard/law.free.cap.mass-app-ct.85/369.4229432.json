L. c. 209A when the subject of that order was also serving a prison sentence for crimes of violence against the plaintiff who obtained the order. We conclude that the judge did not err and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-13\">1. <em>Background. </em>On July 6, 2010, April B. Callahan sought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>and received an abuse prevention order against her then husband, Richard E. Callahan, in the Hampden Division of the Probate and Family Court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The order directed Richard to refrain from abusing April and to vacate and remain away from the marital home, awarded April physical custody of their minor child, and provided visitation to Richard. On July 19, 2010, April moved to amend the order to include no contact with the child. After a hearing at which both parties were present, a judge allowed the motion, modified the order, and continued the matter for further hearing on August 4, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">Later in the day on July 19, 2010, Richard violated the order and was arrested for crimes of violence against April, discussed at greater length below. Although held on bail, Richard appeared at the modification hearing held on August 4, 2010, at which the judge scheduled a review of the order modifications for September 22, 2010.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On September 22, 2010, after further hearing at which both parties appeared, a judge modified the order to include a provision directing Richard not to contact April, to stay twenty-five yards away from her, and to stay away from her workplace. As so modified, the order extended to July 6, 2011, which marked one year from the date of the initial order.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">On July 6, 2011, the abuse prevention order was extended for an additional year, until July 5, 2012. A day later a decree of divorce nisi between the parties entered in the Hampden Division of the Probate and Family Court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">On January 18, 2012, Richard pleaded guilty in Superior Court to multiple indictments as part of a plea agreement. On convictions of criminal harassment (subsequent offense) and intimidation of a witness, he received a sentence of from four years to four years and one day in State prison, and on convictions of assault and battery, two counts of violating an abuse prevention order, and threats, he received concurrent house of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>correction sentences.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In addition, Richard was placed on probation (concurrent with, and from and after, his committed sentences) on multiple charges of breaking and entering. Richard\u2019s terms of probation included orders for global positioning system monitoring, to stay away from and have no contact with April or with the minor child (unless otherwise determined by the Probate and Family Court), to abide by the abuse prevention order, to engage in batterer\u2019s intervention, and to undergo a psychological evaluation and any treatment, medication, and counselling deemed appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">On July 5, 2012, roughly six months after Richard\u2019s sentencing, April sought an extension of the expiring abuse prevention order. Richard opposed the extension and sought to modify or terminate the order. Richard asserted that there was no longer a lawful basis to extend the order because April could not reasonably be in \u201cfear of imminent serious physical harm\u201d from him since he was incarcerated and also under probationary conditions that mirrored those of the abuse prevention order. A probate judge held a hearing at which both parties testified. In addition, April recounted the serious nature of his crimes against her and provided a letter from the district attorney\u2019s office detailing the disposition of the indictments against Richard. April related that despite Richard\u2019s incarceration, she was still in daily fear of him because he had broken into her house, tried to kill her, assaulted and beat her older son, and threatened to cut her throat in front of the children if her older son ran for help. She noted that Richard had violated two abuse prevention orders she had obtained against him and had also violated abuse prevention orders previously obtained by others. April told the judge that without the protection of an abuse prevention order, she was fearful that Richard could write her letters and telephone her. For his part, Richard maintained that the judge lacked a legal basis to extend the order because any fear of \u201cimminent serious physical harm\u201d was unreasonable since he was incapable of physically harming April while incarcerated, and the conditions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>of his probation provided her with the same protections as an abuse prevention order.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">After considering the testimony, evidence (including Richard\u2019s criminal offender record information [CORI] and court activity record information [CARI]<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>), and arguments, the judge found and ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-6\">\u201cMotion denied after hearing (both present and order extended). While deft, is incarcerated, the plff. is clearly and palpably in fear of <em>any </em>contact from him, even telephone or letter. A serious assault took place resulting in Superior Court conviction and sentencing. While it is true deft, cannot assault pltff. from prison, any contact or fear of same will diminish sense of security provided by the order. See CARI/CORI and 1/25/12 letter from Dist. Atty. re charges.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>Whether seeking an initial abuse prevention order under G. L. c. 209A or a later extension, the burden is on the plaintiff to establish facts justifying issuance, or continuance, by a preponderance of the evidence. See <em>Iamele </em>v. Asse<em>lin, </em>444 Mass. 734, 736 (2005) <em>(Iamele); MacDonald </em>v. <em>Caruso, </em>467 Mass. 382, 386 (2014). See also <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>62 Mass. App. Ct. 769, 782 (2005) (proper to extend order set to expire upon showing of \u201ccontinued need\u201d without showing of new abuse); G. L. c. 209A, \u00a7 3.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Richard does not dispute that the initial order was properly issued or that it was predicated on his causing physical harm to April. See G. L. c. 209A, \u00a7 1.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Nor does he dispute that prior extensions of that order were proper. Rather, he argues that the judge erred in granting the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>July, 2012, extension (and denying his motion to modify or terminate) because a necessary prerequisite to extension, fear of <em>\u201cimminent </em>serious physical harm\u201d by April, was lacking since he was in prison. Put differently, he argues that even if April may be in fear of him, she may not reasonably be in fear of <em>\u201cimminent </em>serious physical harm\u201d as his incarceration renders any such fear unreasonable.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">\u201c \u2018Abuse\u2019 has the same statutory definition in the context of initial, extended, and permanent orders.\u201d <em>Vittone </em>v. <em>Clairmont, </em>64 Mass. App. Ct. 479, 485 (2005). While G. L. c. 209A, \u00a7 1, provides that the abuse for which a protective order may issue can take several forms, the only form of abuse applicable here is that which is defined as \u201ccausing physical harm.\u201d Compare <em>l\u00e1mele, supra </em>at 739-740; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>75 Mass. App. Ct. 540, 543 (2009). The central flaw in Richard\u2019s argument is that it ignores the statutory distinction in the definition of \u201cabuse\u201d between abuse resulting from \u201ccausing physical harm\u201d and abuse caused by \u201cplacing another in fear of imminent serious physical harm.\u201d G. L. c. 209A, \u00a7 1. See <em>Iamele, supra </em>at 739-740 &amp; n.3 (\u201ctypically, the inquiry will be whether the plaintiff has a reasonable fear of \u2018imminent serious physical harm,\u2019 \u201d but \u201c[i]f a plaintiff were suffering from attempted or actual physical abuse or involuntary sexual relations, there is no question that an extension should be granted\u201d [citations omitted]). See also <em>MacDonald </em>v. <em>Caruso, </em>467 Mass, at 386, quoting from <em>l\u00e1mele, supra </em>at 735 (\u201cmost commonly\u201d extension of order requires showing of fear of imminent serious physical harm). The situation before the judge in this instance is not a case predicated on \u201cfear of imminent serious physical harm,\u201d but one involving actual physical violence. See <em>Iamele, supra </em>at 740 n.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">General Laws c. 209A embodies the important public policy of preserving the fundamental right to be protected from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>devastating impact of domestic abuse. See <em>MacDonald </em>v. <em>Caruso, supra </em>at 385-386. Although a person seeking an abuse prevention order (and extension) based on \u201cfear of imminent serious physical harm\u201d must always show that he or she is currently in fear of imminent serious physical harm, and that such fear is reasonable, see <em>Iamele, supra </em>at 737, the same is not true of a person who seeks an order (or extension) based on having already been subject to physical harm. In that circumstance, the \u201cabuse\u201d is the physical harm caused, and a judge may reasonably conclude that there is a continued need for the order because the damage resulting from that physical harm affects the victim even when further physical attack is not reasonably imminent because the perpetrator is incarcerated. See <em>Vittone </em>v. <em>Clairmont, </em>64 Mass. App. Ct. at 489 (some wounds so traumatic that passage of time alone does not mitigate victim\u2019s fear of perpetrator).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">That is not to say that a judge must always extend an order predicated on physical abuse on request. It simply means that the failure of the plaintiff to have an objectively reasonable fear of <em>imminent </em>serious physical harm does not by itself preclude extension of an abuse prevention order. Faced with an extension request in such a circumstance, the judge must make a discerning appraisal of the continued need for an abuse prevention order to protect the plaintiff from the impact of the violence already inflicted. The judge must consider the totality of the parties\u2019 relationship and the legislative purpose of preserving \u201cthe fundamental human right to be protected from the devastating impact of family violence.\u201d <em>Iamele, supra </em>at 740, quoting from <em>Champagne </em>v. <em>Champagne, </em>429 Mass. 324, 327 (1999). In making the required assessment, the judge must consider the basis for the initial order in evaluating the risk of harm to the plaintiff should the order expire. Among the nonexclusive factors the judge should consider are \u201cthe defendant\u2019s violations of protective orders, ongoing child custody or other litigation that engenders or is likely to engender hostility, [and] the parties\u2019 demeanor in court. ... No one factor is likely to be determinative. . . . It is the totality of the conditions that exist at the time that the plaintiff seeks the extension, viewed in the light of the initial abuse prevention order, that govern.\u201d <em>Iamele, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>In evaluating whether April met her burden of establishing the continued need to protect her from the physical \u201cabuse\u201d inflicted by Richard, the judge appropriately considered the totality of the circumstances of their relationship as directed by <em>l\u00e1mele, supra. </em>See <em>Vittone </em>v. Clairmont, 64 Mass. App. Ct. at 486-489. To that end, the judge considered Richard\u2019s serious and violent criminal offenses against April and her older son, his prior violations of abuse prevention orders involving her and others, the ongoing child custody litigation in Probate and Family Court regarding visitation with the younger child, and the hostility likely engendered thereby.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> See <em>ibid. </em>The judge reviewed Richard\u2019s CORI and CARI records and a letter from the Hampden County district attorney\u2019s office regarding the recent criminal charges. Finally, the judge observed the parties\u2019 demeanor, and came away convinced that April\u2019s fear of Richard was clear and palpable and that her sense of security would be substantially diminished were the order to expire, leaving Richard free to contact her by letter or telephone. Based on the totality of these circumstances, viewed in light of the initial abuse prevention order, the judge concluded that extending the order for an additional year furthered the legislative purpose of protecting an abuse victim from the impact of family violence. See <em>Champagne </em>v. <em>Champagne, </em>429 Mass, at 327. It is difficult to discern how such thoughtful and reasoned consideration amounts to an abuse of the \u201cbroad\u201d discretion accorded a judge at a renewal hearing. See <em>Crenshaw </em>v. <em>Macklin, </em>430 Mass. 633, 635 (2000); <em>Vittone </em>v. <em>Clairmont, 64 </em>Mass. App. <em>Ct. </em>at 485.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">Nothing in <em>Vittone </em>v. <em>Clairmont, supra, </em>on which Richard relies, is to the contrary. There, in somewhat unusual circumstances, the court upheld the imposition of a permanent abuse prevention order against a defendant who was about to be released after eight years of imprisonment for crimes of sexual abuse against two of his children.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The defendant argued that the judge erred in entering a permanent abuse prevention order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>where the only evidence supporting a reasonable fear of serious physical harm was conduct that occurred more than eight years earlier and involved victims other than the plaintiff. He also argued, as does the defendant here, that the statute requires evidence of recent words or conduct that would place a person in reasonable fear of imminent serious physical harm. In rejecting his claim, the court observed, \u201cNeither the evidence that was before the judge . . . nor the law ... is circumscribed in the rigid manner that the defendant suggests.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 484. Treating the plaintiff\u2019s request for a permanent abuse prevention order as one for extension of an order predicated on \u201cplacing another in fear of imminent serious physical harm,\u201d under G. L. c. 209A, \u00a7 1, the court concluded that the plaintiff\u2019s fear of imminent serious physical harm was objectively reasonable in light of all the circumstances, including not only the defendant\u2019s imminent release, but also the compelling factor that \u201c[t]he infliction of some wounds may be so traumatic that the passage of time alone does not mitigate the victim\u2019s fear of the perpetrator.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 489.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">To the extent Richard relies on <em>Vittone </em>v. <em>Clairmont </em>for the proposition that fear of imminent serious physical harm is always a requisite for extension of an order, regardless of its statutory basis, his reliance is misplaced. Indeed, that case is readily distinguishable as, there, no abuse prevention order had been extant for eight years, the convictions for which the defendant was incarcerated did not involve the plaintiff, and the \u201cabuse\u201d upon which the order was predicated was \u201cfear of imminent serious physical harm.\u201d Here, by contrast, the abuse prevention order had been in continuous existence at the time of the extension hearing, Richard\u2019s incarceration stemmed from his violation of a restraining order taken out by April, and the underlying \u201cabuse\u201d involved Richard \u201ccausing [April] physical harm.\u201d See <em>Iamele, </em>444 Mass, at 739-740. Similarly misplaced is Richard\u2019s contention that <em>Vittone </em>v. <em>Clairmont, </em>64 Mass. App. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>Ct. at 485 n.7, stands for the proposition that extension of an order is not possible when its subject is incarcerated because \u201cimprisonment is, if not the ultimate restraining order, at least its functional equivalent.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Viewed in context, the quoted statement stands as nothing more than an explanation for why the plaintiff there may have let the restraining order lapse for eight years before seeking renewal. To interpret <em>Vittone </em>as holding that absent new threats of harm, an abuse prevention order may not be extended while its subject is incarcerated for abusing the very victim who seeks the extension ignores the facts of that case, the important distinction arising from the different statutory bases of \u201cabuse,\u201d and the reality that abuse occasioned by physical harm may cause wounds that produce long-lasting fear in the victim without new incitements. Compare <em>MacDonald </em>v. Caruso, 467 Mass, at 387, 390-391 (to terminate permanent abuse prevention order defendant must prove by clear and convincing evidence that protected party no longer has reasonable fear of imminent serious physical harm and significant changed circumstances make continuation of order no longer equitable).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">Finally, we observe that the interpretation sought by Richard would turn the policy underlying c. 209A abuse prevention orders on its head. Were fear of \u201cimminent serious physical harm\u201d a sine qua non for extension of an order against a defendant who is imprisoned for physical abuse of the plaintiff, imprisonment would likely provide a victim less protection from abuse than existed before imprisonment, possibly subjecting the victim to unwanted letters, telephone calls, and other contact. Indeed, under such a statutory regime, the worse the physical harm inflicted, and the longer the resulting prison sentence, the less likely it would be reasonable for a victim to fear \u201cimminent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>serious physical harm.\u201d A plaintiff would need to endure unwanted telephone calls, letters, or other contact from the defendant in order to petition for a new abuse prevention order, and even then would face the same objection that the defendant\u2019s imprisonment rendered fear of <em>imminent </em>serious physical harm unreasonable. Such was obviously not the intent of the Legislature, which saw fit to specify that \u201c[t]he fact that abuse has not occurred during the pendency of an order shall not, in itself, constitute sufficient ground for denying or failing to extend the order,\u201d and that \u201c[a]ny action commenced under the provisions of this chapter shall not preclude any other civil or criminal remedies.\u201d G.

That order lapsed when the plaintiff did not seek to have it renewed while the defendant was incarcerated. After being notified the defendant was about to be released from prison, the plaintiff sought an abuse prevention order. See <em>Vittone </em>v. <em>Clairmont, </em>64 Mass. App. Ct. at 481 n.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b409-6\">The court in <em>Vittone </em>also posited that \u201c[g]iven the court\u2019s rescript opinion in <em>Jordan </em>v. <em>Clerk of the Westfield Div. of the Dist.

App. Ct. at 485 n.7. We read <em>Jordan </em>as grounded in the fact that the plaintiff did not seek an order based on the defendant having caused her physical harm, but on his having placed her in fear of imminent serious physical harm while imprisoned. See 425 Mass, at 1017 n.3. In that posture, the plaintiff\u2019s testimony regarding the defendant\u2019s words or conduct that formed the basis of her complaint led the court to conclude that the complaint was unproved on the record before it.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b410-7\">Graham, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AZ\">(concurring). At a hearing on a motion for an extension of an original abuse protection order pursuant to G. L. c. 209A, the inquiry is \u201cwhether the plaintiff has shown by a preponderance of the evidence that an extension of the order is necessary to protect her from the likelihood of \u2018abuse\u2019 as defined in G. L. c. 209A, \u00a7 1.\u201d <em>Iamele </em>v. <em>Asselin, </em>444 Mass. 734, 739 (2005). In determining the issue, a judge must ascertain whether the plaintiff\u2019s \u201cfear of imminent serious physical harm,\u201d G. L. c. 209A, \u00a7 1, is reasonable. \u201c[F] actors that the judge should consider include, but are not limited to . . . the likelihood that the parties will encounter one another in the course of their usual activities (e.g., residential or workplace proximity, attendance at the same place of worship), and significant changes in the circumstances of the parties.\u201d <em>Iamele, supra </em>at 740.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">The defendant argues that the plaintiff cannot satisfy the imminence requirement of the statute where he is incarcerated<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and his release from prison was not imminent at the time of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>extension hearing. See <em>Vittone </em>v. <em>Clairmont, </em>64 Mass.

Further, given the court\u2019s rescript opinion in <em>Jordan </em>v. <em>Clerk of the Westfield Div. of the Dist. Ct Dept., </em>425 Mass. [1016,] 1017 [(1997)], there is some question whether a plaintiff in such circumstances could establish the \u2018imminence\u2019 of any serious physical harm from one who remains incarcerated.\u201d See <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Joyce, </em>421 Mass. 520, 523 n.l (1995) (\u201cA judge must consider carefully whether serious physical harm is imminent [prior to issuing] . . . a G.

On this record, the defendant has not demonstrated that the judge abused his discretion, and accordingly, I concur in the results.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b410-9\">The defendant also was placed on probation, forthwith and from and after the prison sentences. Both the forthwith and from and after probation included <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>as conditions of probation that the defendant stay away and have no contact, direct or indirect, with the plaintiff and their child.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b411-7\">In <em>Vittone, </em>64 Mass. App. Ct. at 482, \u201c[t]he plaintiff had been physically and sexually abused throughout the marriage and the defendant had been threatening to her during the marriage, after their separation, and during the period of time leading up to the trial.\u201d Moreover, while he was in prison, the defendant was held in contempt for having his mother put a lien on family property, and although the terms of his incarceration prohibited him from contacting the plaintiff, the defendant used the Internet and print media to blame the plaintiff for having falsely accused him of a crime. <em>Id. </em>at 482-483.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b411-8\">The plaintiff and defendant had not been in contact since his arrest in 2010. In addition, there was no evidence presented at the extension hearing that the defendant\u2019s conduct in prison revealed an intent to abuse the plaintiff. However, \u201c[t]he fact that abuse has not occurred during the pendency of an order shall not, in itself, constitute sufficient ground for denying or failing to extend the order.\u201d G. L. c. 209A, \u00a7 3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
