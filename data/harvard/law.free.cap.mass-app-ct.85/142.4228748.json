Such a result cannot be countenanced by any court of law. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Housing Court in this summary process litigation restoring Furtick\u2019s housing benefits retroactively to the date of the unlawful termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\"><em>Facts. </em>Except where noted, the following facts are undisputed. On January 17, 2012, the leased housing division of the BHA sent a letter addressed to Furtick at his subsidized apartment in Salem, notifying him of the proposed termination of his housing assistance benefits based upon his failure to attend two section 8 voucher recertification meetings scheduled for November 28, 2011, and December 22, 2011. See \u00a7 13.6.2 of the BHA Administrative Plan for Section 8 Programs (revised December 6, 2011) (BHA administrative plan). The BHA letter informed Furtick that he had the right to an informal hearing regarding the proposed termination before the BHA\u2019s department of grievances and appeals as long as he requested a hearing within twenty days. See <em>id. </em>at \u00a7 13.6.3. When Furtick failed to respond within the twenty-day appeal period, the BHA, by letter dated February 7, 2012, and mailed to his apartment, terminated Furtick\u2019s subsidy effective March 31, 2012. As Furtick was in jail during that time, he had no actual knowledge of any of this.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Upon his release, Furtipk returned to his apartment and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>discovered that not only had the landlord changed the lock, but the BHA had terminated his benefits.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">On April 10, 2012, he personally traveled to the BHA\u2019s department of grievances and appeals and attempted to appeal the termination decision, explaining the reasons for his nonattendance at the recertification meetings as well as for his failure to request a timely hearing. The BHA representative informed him that a decision whether to grant a late hearing would be issued within ninety days, a fact reflected on the receipt provided to Furtick. Furtick indicated that he was temporarily living at the Lynn Emergency Shelter and asked that the BHA notice of the decision be sent there. After gaining access to his apartment again within a few days, he called the BHA, updating his address. At that time, the BHA did not inform him that on the very day of his visit, the BHA had mailed out notice of an adverse decision to him at the Lynn Emergency Shelter.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">Meanwhile, also in April of 2012, Furtick\u2019s landlord, prompted by the cessation of the BHA\u2019s payment of its share <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>of the rent, commenced a summary process action against him. Furtick defended in part by lodging a third-party complaint against the BHA, in which he sought reinstatement of his section 8 voucher. The BHA moved to dismiss on grounds that it could not properly be impleaded in the summary process case and that Furtick\u2019s complaint was time-barred. After two days of hearings, a judge of the Northeast Division of the Housing Court Department, acting on the undisputed facts, declined to allow the BHA\u2019s motion and instead ordered the reinstatement of Furtick\u2019s section 8 benefits retroactively to the date of their termination. Before us now is the BHA\u2019s appeal from the resulting judgment on the third-party complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\"><em>Discussion. Third-party claim. </em>There was no error in the allowance of Furtick\u2019s motion to file a third-party complaint against the BHA. Rule 14(a) of the Massachusetts Rules of Civil Procedure, as amended, 385 Mass. 1216 (1982), permits a defendant to bring in a third party \u201cwho is or may be liable to him for all or part of the plaintiff\u2019s claim against him.\u201d In the underlying summary process action here, the landlord sought rent arrearage from Furtick. BHA was potentially liable for contribution, and thus a proper candidate for impleader. See <em>Gabbidon </em>v. <em>King, </em>414 Mass. 685, 686-687 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">Although the Uniform Summary Process (USP) Rules govern procedure in summary process cases, no USP rule specifically addresses third-party practice. In this situation, the Massachusetts Rules of Civil Procedure apply unless \u201cinconsistent with [the USP] rules, with applicable statutory law or with the jurisdiction of the particular court [here, the Housing Court].\u201d Rule 1 of the Uniform Summary Process Rules (1980). See <em>Deutsche Bank Natl. Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Gabriel, </em>81 Mass. App. Ct. 564, 571 n.17 (2012). We find no such inconsistency here. Nothing in G. L. c. 239, the summary process statute, can be read to limit a section 8 participant\u2019s right to bring a third-party complaint against a public housing authority or plan administrator. Contrast <em>Fafard </em>v. <em>Lincoln Pharmacy of Milford, Inc., </em>439 Mass. 512, 515 (2003) (concluding that counterclaim could not be brought in commercial eviction cases where G. L. c. 239, \u00a7 8A, expressly limited that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>right to actions \u201cto recover possession of any premises rented or leased <em>for dwelling purposes\u201d)</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">The case of <em>Cummings Properties, LLC </em>v. <em>Cepoint Networks, LLC, </em>78 Mass. App. Ct. 287 (2010), is inapposite. In <em>Cummings, </em>this court held that a private guarantor of a commercial lease, who lacked a possessory interest in the leasehold, was not a proper defendant in a summary process action. In reaching this holding, we construed the language of G. L. c. 239, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2, to require a defendant to be in possession of the property. <em>Id. </em>at 288-289. A contrary holding would have been inconsistent with the plain language of the statute. <em>Id. </em>at 290. Here, in contrast, the statute is silent on third-party practice. There is no requirement under our jurisprudence that a third-party defendant be in possession of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">Express legislative intent, moreover, to permit third-party practice appears in G. L. c. 185C, \u00a7 19 (requiring clerks of the Housing Court to impose a fee of $120 for the filing of a third-party complaint or a motion to intervene as a plaintiff).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Compare <em>Bank of America, N.A. </em>v. <em>Rosa, </em>466 Mass. 613, 625 n.11 (2013) (noting that a G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 9, claim can be brought in the Housing Court, as provided in G. L. c. 185C, \u00a7 3, by way of a third-party action). Rule 14(a) applied here and authorized the filing of a third-party claim.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">The judge did not err by denying the BHA\u2019s motion to dismiss based on the asserted untimeliness of Furtick\u2019s third-party claim. The BHA was not entitled to pigeonhole Furtick\u2019s claim as one brought under the certiorari statute with its short limitations period of sixty days. See G. L. c. 249, \u00a7 4. As the Housing Court judge noted, the substance of Furtick\u2019s third-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>party complaint challenged the propriety of the procedure employed by the BHA in his case, the essence of a Federal civil rights claim.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> See <em>Carter </em>v. <em>Lynn Hous. Authy., </em>450 Mass. 626, 633 (2008) (\u201c[JJudicial review of the decision to terminate [a housing benefit] \u2018has long been framed as a claim for deprivation of a vested property interest without due process of law\u2019 \u201d), quoting from <em>Wojcik </em>v. <em>Lynn Hous. Authy., </em>66 Mass. App. Ct. 103, 105 n.4 (2006); <em>Costa </em>v. <em>Fall River Hous. Authy., </em>71 Mass. App. Ct. 269, 274 &amp; n.5 (2008) (concluding that Housing Court properly exercised jurisdiction over tenant\u2019s 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claims in complaint alleging housing authority did not afford due process in terminating tenant\u2019s section 8 benefits), <em>S.C., </em>453 Mass. 614 (2009).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\"><em>Unfair process. </em>Furtick\u2019s sole source of income is his Social Security disability insurance benefits, an amount clearly insufficient to cover market-rate rent. According to his doctors, given his serious medical problems, the absence of decent, sanitary housing would place Furtick\u2019s health at serious risk.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Before terminating Furtick\u2019s critical housing assistance, the BHA was required to provide him with a fair process. See <em>Carter </em>v. <em>Lynn Hous. Authy., </em>450 Mass, at 637-638. Nothing of the sort was provided here.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">First, the February 7, 2012, section 8 benefits termination notice from the BHA\u2019s leased housing division was defective. It incorrectly stated that \u201cthis decision is final and there is no further right to appeal this decision of the BHA.\u201d In fact, under the BHA administrative plan\u2019s termination procedure, a participant may obtain an administrative appeal hearing on the decision through a late request upon a showing of compelling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>circumstances.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> No BHA representative informed Furtick of the compelling circumstances policy, or explained how to meet its requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">In her brief decision dated April 10, 2012, the BHA grievances and appeals administrator denied Furtick\u2019s request for a late hearing, and upheld the termination decision, based upon Furtick\u2019s failure to request a hearing within the initial twenty-day period (a factual impossibility) and his failure to provide evidence of compelling circumstances (a requirement about which he was not told). The BHA official signed the decision as an <em>administrator. </em>No compelling circumstances evaluation was made here by a <em>hearing officer </em>as required by the BHA administrative plan. See note 12, <em>supra. </em>Indeed, it is entirely unclear whether the administrator was even aware of Furtick\u2019s individual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>circumstances. The BHA\u2019s failure to follow its own policy set forth in the BHA administrative plan was a violation of HUD regulations.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> See 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.54(c) (2012). The administrative decision resting upon such a flawed process was invalid and cannot stand. See <em>Wojcik </em>v. <em>Lynn Hous. Authy., </em>66 Mass. App. Ct. at 115. The finding of compelling circumstances as matter of law by the Housing Court judge was not shown to be incorrect. In the unique circumstances of the case and all that Furtick has endured, we decline to disturb the judge\u2019s ruling reinstating the housing assistance benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\"><em>Conclusion. </em>The overarching mission of the BHA is to provide housing assistance to poor and low-income individuals. See <em>Boston Hous. Authy. </em>v. <em>National Conference of Firemen &amp; Oilers, Local 3, </em>458 Mass. 155, 156 (2010). In its rush to recapture Furtick\u2019s section 8 voucher, the BHA seems to have lost sight of its mission here.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The seasoned Housing Court judge pointed out the big picture to the BHA and suggested a reasonable settlement of this litigation (a hearing for Furtick). Compare <em>Casavant </em>v. <em>Norwegian Cruise Line, Ltd., 63 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 785, 800 (2005) (Brown, J., concurring) (\u201c[Cjounsel would [have been] well advised to attempt to settle this matter amicably, rather than pursue it further in the courts . . .\u201d). The BHA ignored the advice, opting to pursue this case to the bitter end, a confounding decision in light of the serious procedural unfairness apparent on this record.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b175-7\">For a description of the section 8 voucher program, and an overview of its operation, see <em>Wojcik </em>v. <em>Lynn Hous. Authy., </em>66 Mass. App. Ct. 103, 103 n.2 (2006). The Boston Housing Authority (BHA) is a public housing authority that administers the program on behalf of the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). The BHA was required to adopt a written plan establishing local policies for the administration of the program that was consistent with the regulations and requirements of HUD. See <em>id. </em>at 108 n.7; 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.54(a), (b) (2012). As applicable in this case, that written plan is the BHA Administrative Plan for Section 8 programs (revised December 6, 2011).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b175-8\">Having pleaded guilty in early November, 2011, to charges of threatening <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>his former wife, Furtick was incarcerated during that time at the Essex County house of correction. Although Furtick notified his landlord of his whereabouts, he did not tell the BHA about his incarceration. Mail addressed to him at his apartment was not forwarded to him at the house of correction. Furtick was released on March 30, 2012.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b176-10\">The actions of the landlord on or about March 30, 2012, are in dispute. In his affidavit, Furtick averred that his landlord would not let him into his apartment until he paid his rent arrearage. In her affidavit, the property manager claimed that while she did in fact change the lock, she did so in order to protect Furtick\u2019s possessions from his former wife, an unauthorized tenant living in the apartment; and that furthermore, Furtick did not request the new key until April 11, 2012. A lockout without judicial process would, of course, have been illegal. In any event, as a result of the distressing news, Furtick began suffering from hallucinations and hearing voices. He was hospitalized in a locked psychiatric unit at the Carney Hospital for one week. The hospital discharged him to the Lynn Emergency Shelter, a homeless shelter for single adults.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b176-11\">The Lynn Emergency Shelter did not forward to Furtick the BHA\u2019s notice of its decision sent by regular mail, and the notice sent by certified mail was returned to the BHA unclaimed. Furtick did not learn of the decision until a Neighborhood Legal Services staff member uncovered the letter in Furtick\u2019s BHA file in July, 2012. As late as August 1, 2012, the BHA caused Carol Segal, a housing advocate from Greater Lynn Senior Services assisting Furtick, to believe that the appeal process was still ongoing, permitting her to fax to the BHA letters from Furtick\u2019s doctors and therapists supporting his request for the reinstatement of his benefits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b178-8\">Nor is there a deficiency in Housing Court jurisdiction over the matter. See <em>Costa </em>v. <em>Fall River Hous. Authy., </em>71 Mass. App. Ct. 269, 274 &amp; n.5 (2008), discussed <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b178-9\">The Housing Court clerk\u2019s office waived the fee here based upon Furtick\u2019s indigency.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b178-10\">To the extent that the BHA argues that a section 8 participant has no standing to enforce a public housing authority\u2019s housing assistance payments (HAP) contract with the landlord, suffice it to say that Furtick has never attempted to do so. No ruling was obtained on the BHA\u2019s claim that it had no obligation under the HAP contract to make rental payments while Furtick was not \u201cresiding\u201d in the apartment. The issue was neither developed below nor properly preserved for review.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b179-7\">Furtick\u2019s handwritten third-party complaint did not specify under which statute he was seeking relief. During the first oral argument on the BHA\u2019s motion to dismiss, the judge opined that Furtick had stated a claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b179-8\">Not only is the BHA\u2019s argument that any claim by Furtick under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 was subject to the presentment requirement raised for the first time on appeal in violation of our procedural rules, it has no merit.
