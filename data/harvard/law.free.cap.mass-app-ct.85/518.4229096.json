Kindregan, Reforming Alimony: Massachusetts Reconsiders Postdivorce Spousal Support, 46 Suffolk U. L. Rev. 13, 16, 18 (2013). In this case, we review the application of key provisions of the Act, which has received only limited appellate consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">The husband appeals from an amended judgment of divorce nisi entered August 30, 2012, by the Probate and Family Court, excluding the wife\u2019s interest in certain real property from the marital estate, and establishing a \u201cself-modifying\u201d alimony order. The husband contends that the alimony order does not comport with the guidelines of the Act, and that the exclusion of the wife\u2019s property from the divisible estate was plainly wrong. For the reasons that follow, we conclude it is necessary to vacate the amended judgment in part and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\"><em>Background, </em>a. <em>Evidence. </em>The parties married on September 18, 1988, and lived together until December 28, 2009. Two sons, both in college at the time of trial, were bom of the over twenty-year marriage. In 1982, the husband graduated from dental school and joined his father\u2019s practice, becoming an equal partner pursuant to a \u201cbuy-in\u201d agreement prior to the marriage. The wife was a homemaker and primary caretaker of the children, while the husband was the sole wage earner. Although she earned a bachelor\u2019s degree and was briefly employed outside the home, the wife was laid off in early 1989 and has not been otherwise employed since before her first son was born. During the marriage, the family lived a \u201ccomfortable\u201d lifestyle, with the husband working full time as a dentist and the wife tending to the home and children and volunteering to support their various activities, including sports, Cub Scouts, and private-school events.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">In 1996, the wife acquired by inheritance a one-third share in Pond View Associates, a real estate partnership with her two siblings which holds title to a property in Chatham on Cape <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>Cod.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The wife\u2019s parents had purchased the Chatham property and on it built their retirement home, now maintained by the wife and her siblings. When not rented out to vacationers, the three siblings and their families have used the Chatham property as a getaway. During the marriage, the parties and their children spent at least two weeks there each summer, where they maintained various memberships in the community.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">In 1997, the husband\u2019s father retired and gifted to the husband his one-half interest in the dental practice,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> simultaneously forgiving the $125,000 balance outstanding from their buy-in agreement. Another dentist subsequently joined the practice as a partner and entered into a similar buy-in agreement, with the husband receiving from it an additional $90,000 annually for five years ending in 2010. The partners began renovating and expanding the practice in 2008, prior to the initiation of divorce proceedings by the wife in October, 2009. At the time of trial in November, 2011, the husband reported gross annual income of $359,858 for the 2010 tax year,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> along with $22,000 in voluntary contributions to his 401(k) retirement account.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">b. <em>Judge\u2019s findings of fact. </em>The judge issued his findings and memorandum of decision on May 15, 2012.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> He found that the husband\u2019s income has been relatively stable since 2007, but that due to the additional $90,000 annual income no longer being owed by his partner after 2010, \u201c[i]t would be inequitable to calculate an alimony obligation using the average income over <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>the buy-in period unless the purchase monies were excluded.\u201d The judge credited the husband\u2019s testimony that the debt he incurred while renovating and relocating the dental practice \u201cha[d] not resulted in any further net income to date[,] but as the debt is paid down, the investment should prove profitable.\u201d The judge explained that the \u201cself-modifying\u201d alimony order<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> would allow the wife to \u201ccontinue to realize some benefits for the investment in the [hjusband\u2019s practice made during the years of the marriage,\u201d and to \u201cshare in any increased profitability\u201d of the practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">The judge also found that the wife\u2019s interest in the Chatham property \u201cwas never relied upon as a financial resource by the parties during the marriage,\u201d and that its \u201cimpact on the taxes owed was negligible.\u201d Thus, the interest in the Chatham property was assigned wholly to the wife and did not form part of the divisible marital estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">c. <em>Judge\u2019s rulings. </em>The trial judge awarded the husband the stipulated value of his interest in the dental practice, which was $476,000. The wife was awarded her interest in Pond View Associates. The judge ordered the sale of the marital home, with the first $238,000 in net proceeds going to the wife (representing a fifty percent share of the husband\u2019s interest in the dental practice), and the remainder divided evenly between the spouses.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">The husband was ordered to pay base alimony in the amount of $8,500 per month, and \u201cadditional alimony equal to thirty (30%) percent of his gross income in excess of $250,000.00, from all sources . . . payable quarterly.\u201d To facilitate this \u201cself-modifying\u201d alimony order, the husband was directed to provide quarterly documentation of his income to the wife. Under the terms of the order, alimony is to. continue until the first of four events: the wife\u2019s remarriage or cohabitation; the wife\u2019s death; the husband\u2019s death; or the \u201c[hjusband\u2019s retirement as defined in the Act. . ., as it may be amended.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>The husband\u2019s motion to stay the judgment was denied, and this appeal followed entry of the amended judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">d. <em>Alimony Reform Act of 2011.</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The Act modified G. L. c. 208 by essentially removing the substance of the alimony determination from G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 34, and placing it under new alimony provisions, G. L. c. 208, \u00a7\u00a7 48 to 55. Section 34, as before the Act, continues to govern property division, by providing that a court with personal jurisdiction over the parties may, upon divorce or in an action thereafter, assign to either husband or wife \u201call or any part of the estate of the other, including but not limited to\u201d enumerated \u201cbenefits, rights and funds accrued during the marriage.\u201d G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 34, as amended by St. 1990, c. 467. The Act also retains the feature of the prior law in which there are specific, mandatory factors that the judge must consider in making such a property division, as well as specific, discretionary factors that the judge may consider.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The Act altered neither the fundamental purpose nor the basic definition of alimony: \u201cthe payment of support from a spouse, who has the ability to pay, to a spouse in need of support.\u201d G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 48.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">Three aspects of the Act are at issue in the instant case. First is the statutory formula providing that \u201cthe amount of alimony should generally not exceed the recipient\u2019s need or [thirty] to [thirty-five] per cent of the difference between the parties\u2019 gross incomes established at the time of the order being issued,\u201d G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 53(\u00bf&gt;), and the grounds for deviation from that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>formula, G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 53(e). Second is the amendment to G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 34, governing property division, deeming \u201cthe amount and duration of alimony awarded under [\u00a7\u00a7 48 to 55]\u201d to be an additional mandatory factor now relevant to the equitable property distribution. Third is the interrelationship between the Act\u2019s presumptive time limits for alimony orders as determined by the length of the marriage, G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 <em>49(b), </em>its provision that \u201cgeneral term alimony\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> must \u201cterminate upon the payor attaining the full retirement age,\u201d G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 <em>49(f), </em>and the grounds for deviation from these presumptions, G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 53.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>Under prior law, St. 1974, c. 565, which was in effect (with occasional amendments) from October 19, 1974, to March 1, 2012, an award of alimony had to be based on the so-called mandatory and discretionary factors set forth in G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 34, although there was recognition that judges had \u201ca large measure of discretion.\u201d <em>Rice </em>v. <em>Rice, </em>372 Mass. 398, 400 (1977). See <em>Bianco </em>v. <em>Bianco, </em>371 Mass. 420, 422-423 (1976) (confirming that under 1974 law, judges had broad discretion provided that they considered all statutory factors and made required findings of fact). Alimony and property division were closely connected, as evidenced by the fact that they were \u201cgoverned by the same controlling factors\u201d enumerated in \u00a7 34. Kindregan, Reforming Alimony: Massachusetts Reconsiders Postdivorce Spousal Support, 46 Suffolk U. L. Rev. 13, 23 (2013). \u201cThe new Alimony Reform Act of 2011 separates these factors into different sections of [c. 208], but keeps a connection by amending [\u00a7 34] to provide that in addition to other factors, the court is to consider the \u2018amount and duration of alimony\u2019 when dividing property.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>See note 10, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">In reviewing a property division under G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 34, or an alimony award under G. L. c. 208, \u00a7\u00a7 48-55,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> an appellate court conducts a two-step analysis. <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>459 Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>361, 371 (2011). First, we examine the trial judge\u2019s findings to determine whether all relevant factors were considered (and whether irrelevant factors were disregarded). See <em>Rice </em>v. <em>Rice, supra </em>at 401-402; <em>Bowring </em>v. <em>Reid, </em>399 Mass. 265, 267 (1987). Next, we decide whether the rationale underlying the judge\u2019s conclusions is apparent and whether these \u201cflow rationally from the findings and rulings.\u201d <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Massa, </em>431 Mass. 619, 631 (2000). We do not substitute our judgment for that of the judge below but, rather, \u201cscrutinize without deference the propriety of the legal criteria employed by the trial judge and the manner in which those criteria were applied to the facts.\u201d <em>Iamele </em>v. <em>Asselin, </em>444 Mass. 734, 741 (2005). Furthermore, because the judge has considerable discretion, determinations as to alimony and property division will not be reversed unless plainly wrong and excessive. <em>Redding </em>v. <em>Redding, </em>398 Mass. 102, 107 (1986). Finally, in the present case, we are mindful that the judge was addressing difficult questions about the application of a new and comprehensive legislative scheme without the benefit of guidance from an appellate court.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">a. <em>Alimony order. </em>1. <em>Amount and form. </em>The Act makes no change in the fundamental purpose of alimony, which is to provide for postdivorce economic support of a spouse who was financially dependent during the marriage. <em>Gottsegen </em>v. <em>Gottsegen, </em>397 Mass. 617, 623 (1986). See G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 48. Pursuant to the Act, a judge determining the form, amount, and duration of an alimony award must consider \u201cthe length of the marriage; age of the parties; health of the parties; income, employment and employability of both parties . . .; economic and non-economic contribution of both parties to the marriage; marital lifestyle; ability of each party to maintain the marital lifestyle; lost economic opportunity as a result of the marriage; and such other factors as the court considers relevant and material.\u201d G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 53(a). Although the Act creates express guidelines to aid judges in fashioning alimony orders, it does not alter the principle that the central issue relevant to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>financial award is the dependent spouse\u2019s \u201cneed for support and maintenance in relationship to the respective financial circumstances of the parties.\u201d <em>Partridge </em>v. <em>Partridge, </em>14 Mass. App. Ct. 918, 919 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">General Laws c. 208, \u00a7 53(6), sets forth a formula for determining the amount of the alimony order, which, \u201c[ejxcept for reimbursement alimony or circumstances warranting deviation for other forms of alimony, should generally not exceed the recipient\u2019s need <em>or </em>[thirty] to [thirty-five] per cent of the difference between the parties\u2019 gross incomes established at the time of the order being issued\u201d (emphasis supplied). Our responsibility is to interpret the Act as written, assigning to each word and phrase its ordinary meaning unless the context requires otherwise and attaching significance to every word unless it produces an irrational result. See <em>Hinckley </em>v. <em>Retirement Bd. of Gloucester, </em>316 Mass. 496, 500 (1944); <em>Holmes </em>v. <em>Holmes, </em>467 Mass. 653, 659 (2014). See also G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 6, Third. The Legislature\u2019s decision to use the emphasized word \u201cor\u201d in this provision of the Act means that, \u201cexcept for reimbursement alimony or circumstances warranting deviation for other forms of alimony,\u201d an alimony award that is equivalent to thirty to thirty-five percent of the difference between the parties\u2019 gross incomes as determined when the order issues will be deemed reasonable and lawful. G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 53(6). Furthermore, \u00a7 53(e) provides that when establishing an initial alimony award or in approving a modification of a prior alimony award, a judge may deviate from the \u201cduration and amount limits\u201d for general term alimony or rehabilitative alimony only if the judge makes \u201cwritten findings that deviation is necessary.\u201d G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 53(e). Any such order deviating from the requirements of \u00a7 53(6) must be based on one or more of the first eight factors listed in \u00a7 53(e) or, \u201cupon written findings, any other factor that the court deems relevant and material.\u201d G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 53(e)(9).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">In reviewing the alimony order in this case, we first examine whether the judge considered all relevant factors required by \u00a7 53(a). The judge appropriately made reference in his findings to the over twenty-year length of the marriage, the spouses\u2019 ages, and their respective incomes, employment, and employ-ability; however, it is not clear that he considered the ability of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>each party to maintain the marital lifestyle. Although the parties\u2019 stipulation that they maintained a \u201ccomfortable\u201d lifestyle during the marriage is incorporated by reference into the judge\u2019s findings, there is no finding with regard to the wife\u2019s ability or inability to maintain that lifestyle after the divorce.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">It is undisputed that the wife has no income of her own, and we infer that the trial judge, in his discretion, determined the husband\u2019s annual income to be $250,000.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The alimony order of $8,500 per month is nearly forty-one percent of the difference in incomes, thus exceeding the thirty to thirty-five percent range set forth in \u00a7 53(6). While such an award may nonetheless be reasonable and lawful under \u00a7 53(6) if based on a specific determination of the recipient\u2019s need (and assuming a proper consideration of the other spouse\u2019s ability to pay), we cannot say that is the case here because the judge made no finding as to the amount of alimony the wife needed in order to maintain the lifestyle she enjoyed during the marriage. See <em>Heins </em>v. <em>Ledis, </em>422 Mass. 477, 484 (1996) (\u201cAn award of alimony is improper absent a finding of financial need on the part of the recipient spouse\u201d). Because the order for general support alimony as presently constituted does not flow rationally from the judge\u2019s findings, it is not in compliance with \u00a7 53(6). See <em>Bowring, </em>399 Mass, at 267; <em>Williams, </em>431 Mass, at 631.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">Furthermore, we are unable to uphold the so-called \u201cself-modifying\u201d portion of the alimony order. See <em>Grubert </em>v. <em>Grubert, </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. 811, 811 (1985) (\u201c[T]he financial arrangement, taken as a whole, did not adequately take into account traditional alimony considerations and resulted in an inequitable award\u201d). It appears that the judge intended this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>provision to allow the wife to share in the future earnings of the husband\u2019s dental practice, in recognition of her contributions during the marriage. However, as the husband correctly points out, \u00a7 53(6) requires the judge to determine the parties\u2019 respective needs and incomes <em>at the time the order is issued. </em>It is also significant that the Act recognizes for the first time in Massachusetts four different types of alimony awards: \u201cgeneral term alimony,\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> \u201crehabilitative alimony,\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> \u201creimbursement alimony,\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and \u201ctransitional alimony.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> On the record before us, the judge\u2019s self-modifying alimony does not fit into one of the four types of alimony awards authorized by the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">Moreover, there are two features of the judge\u2019s self-modifying order that cannot be reconciled with the Act.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> First, under the Act as well as traditional Massachusetts practice, a modification of an alimony order must be based upon a material change in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>the parties\u2019 circumstances. See G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 49(e) (\u201cUnless the payor and recipient agree otherwise, general term alimony may be modified in duration or amount upon a material change of circumstances warranting modification\u201d); <em>Kelley </em>v. <em>Kelley, </em>64 Mass. App. Ct. 733, 739, 740 (2005) (although power of Probate and Family Court to modify alimony order is \u201cbroad and general,\u201d \u201cno modification can be made unless the party seeking modification shows a change of circumstances since the entry of the earlier judgment,\u201d quoting from <em>Binder </em>v. <em>Binder, </em>7 Mass. App. Ct. 751, 754 [1979]; \u201cThe proper focus of the modification inquiry must be whether there has been a material change in circumstances\u201d). Ordinarily, a party seeking upward modification must show both increased need and ability of the obligor to satisfy that need. Here, however, the self-modifying feature of the order, which requires the husband to pay additional alimony in the amount of thirty percent of income earned beyond $250,000, is not based on a judicial determination, supported by subsidiary findings of fact, of an increase in the wife\u2019s need accompanied by the husband\u2019s ability to provide for the same. See <em>Pierce </em>v. <em>Pierce, </em>455 Mass. 286, 293 (2009) (\u201c[E]very modification judgment requires findings of fact, conclusions of law, and the exercise of discretion\u201d). While the husband would need to file a complaint for modification and show a change in circumstances to reduce his alimony obligation, under the self-modifying order the wife has no corresponding burden and will automatically realize the benefit of any increase to the husband\u2019s income \u2014 whether from the dental practice or from any other source.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">Second, the order is inequitable because it requires <em>only </em>the husband to disclose quarterly income to the wife, but imposes no reciprocal duty on the wife.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Under this arrangement, the husband is deprived of information with which he could determine whether a material change has occurred in the wife\u2019s needs or income; indeed, without a corresponding duty on the wife\u2019s part to disclose, he has no way to learn of any earnings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>she may have in the future. Under the order, the wife may monitor the husband\u2019s compliance and will benefit from automatic increases in her alimony award without the need to return to court; the husband, on the other hand, must file a complaint to have the order modified, while simultaneously lacking access to the information required to prove a material change in circumstances. For these reasons, the order for self-modifying alimony is not consistent with the requirements of G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 53. See <em>Bowring, </em>399 Mass, at 267-268. The alimony order, which is contained in paragraph 16 of the amended judgment, must be vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">2. <em>Duration. </em>As created by the Act, G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 49, sets forth presumptive time limits for orders of general term alimony, based upon the length of the marriage.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Alimony orders may be issued that are effective \u201cfor an indefinite length of time\u201d where the length of the marriage, as here, was more than twenty years. G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 49(c). However, the Act qualifies the duration of an \u201cindefinite\u201d alimony order: notwithstanding \u00a7 49(c), \u00a7 49(/) provides by default that a general term alimony order terminates \u201cupon the payor attaining the full retirement age.\u201d In turn, \u201c[fjull retirement age\u201d is generally defined to mean \u201cthe payor\u2019s normal retirement age to be eligible to receive full retirement benefits under the United States Old Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance program\u201d (Social Security). G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 48. Deviation from the \u00a7 49(/) default duration at the time of the issuance of the general term alimony order requires a showing of good cause and specific written findings by the judge. G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 49(/)(l). A later extension of the duration of an existing alimony order requires good cause shown and written findings of a material change in circumstances and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>of reasons for the extension supported by clear and convincing evidence. G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 4900(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">In the present case, unless preceded by either party\u2019s death or the wife\u2019s cohabitation, the judge\u2019s order directs the husband to continue paying alimony until his \u201cretirement as defined in the Act Reforming Alimony of 2011, as it may be amended.\u201d The judge did not make a written explanation of the precise intent of the order or suggest why he may have intended to deviate from the \u00a7 <em>49(f) </em>default that the order will terminate upon the husband\u2019s reaching \u201cfull retirement age.\u201d The trial transcript suggests to us that the judge was aware of the Act\u2019s default duration and intended for it to apply in this case.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The husband nonetheless argues that the order is ambiguous because the Act does not define the term \u201cretirement,\u201d and the order could therefore be read to terminate instead upon the husband\u2019s <em>actual </em>retirement. Because the order could be read as the husband suggests and because the case must be remanded in any event, we also vacate and remand this portion of the amended judgment to enable the judge to eliminate the ambiguity.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">b. <em>Assignment of property. </em>Finally, we turn to the primary aspect of the division of the marital estate challenged on appeal, namely, the exclusion of the wife\u2019s interest in the Chatham property from the divisible marital estate. A party\u2019s estate includes all property to which she or he holds title, regardless of the source. Williams, 431 Mass, at 625. The Act does not alter the purpose of a property division under G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 34: \u201cto recognize and equitably recompense the parties\u2019 respective contributions to the marital partnership.\u201d <em>Kittredge </em>v. Kittredge, 441 Mass. 28, 44 (2004), quoting from <em>Heacock </em>v. <em>Heacock, </em>402 Mass. 21, 24 (1988). Also, under prior law as well as the Act, whether a spouse\u2019s interest in property is part of the marital <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>estate is a question of law. <em>Lauricella </em>v. <em>Lauricella, </em>409 Mass. 211, 213 &amp; n.2 (1991).<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">Section 34 contains both mandatory and discretionary factors that must be considered, see <em>Drapek </em>v. <em>Drapek, </em>399 Mass. 240, 243 (1987), and allows a judge to \u201cassign to either husband or wife all or any part of the estate of the other.\u201d In addition to the mandatory factors present in the prior version of \u00a7 34, the Act added for consideration \u201cthe amount and duration of alimony, if any.\u201d St. 2011, c. 124, \u00a7 2. These factors \u201creflect a view of marriage as an implied partnership for the purposes of distribution of property.\u201d <em>Savides </em>v. <em>Savides, </em>400 Mass. 250, 252 (1987). Since the adoption of the Act, we have reiterated that \u201c[t]he parties\u2019 respective contributions to the marital partnership remain the touchstone of an equitable division of the marital estate.\u201d <em>T.E. </em>v. <em>A.O., </em>82 Mass. App. Ct. 586, 597 (2012), quoting from <em>Moriarty </em>v. <em>Stone, </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. 151, 157 (1996). When a judge has considered all the required factors and they are adequately reflected in his findings and rulings, they will not be disturbed on appeal unless they are \u201cplainly wrong and excessive.\u201d <em>Bak </em>v. <em>Bak, </em>24 Mass. App. Ct. 608, 620 (1987), quoting from <em>Redding, </em>398 Mass, at 107-108.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>Here, the judge considered nearly all of the statutory factors. See <em>Bianco, </em>371 Mass, at 423. However, the lack of specific findings with regard to the parties\u2019 financial needs is problematic. Additionally, it is not clear from the judge\u2019s decision that his alimony order was properly factored into his order for the division of the marital property, as \u00a7 34 requires. See <em>Grubert, </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. at 811.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">Between them, the spouses owned three principal assets with a total stipulated value of $1.4 million: the marital home ($670,000); the husband\u2019s interest in his dental practice ($476,000); and the wife\u2019s one-third interest in Pond View Associates, the partnership owning the Chatham property ($300,000). We note in passing that both the husband\u2019s interest in the dental practice and the wife\u2019s interest in the Chatham property were, at least in part, gifted to the respective spouses during the marriage by family members, and enjoyed by the family during the marriage. Though the husband was awarded his interest in the practice, the wife was duly compensated for her share of that interest with $238,000 in liquidated funds from the sale of the home. In contrast, the husband received no compensation for the wife\u2019s interest in the Chatham property, which was excluded entirely from the marital estate. The judge\u2019s reasoning was that the Chatham property \u201cwas never relied upon as a financial resource by the parties during the marriage.\u201d The court further found that \u201c[wjhile it was listed on a few of the joint income tax returns, the impact on the taxes owed was negligible.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">In view of the family\u2019s enjoyment of the Chatham property during the marriage \u2014 contributed by the wife to the marital partnership \u2022\u2014 the exclusion of the wife\u2019s interest in the Chatham property cannot be sustained. We think the judge took too narrow a view of \u201cfinancial reliance\u201d upon an asset, evidently basing his analysis solely on the asset\u2019s impact on the family\u2019s tax obligations. It is undisputed that the parties and their children spent annual summer vacations at the Chatham property. The wife\u2019s one-third share of Pond View Associates was valued at $300,000, which results in an approximation of the value of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>property at $900,000.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Had the wife\u2019s interest in this property been unavailable to the family during the marriage, the parties would have incurred significant costs to rent a comparable property for summer vacations. It follows that the wife\u2019s interest in the Chatham property provided tangible financial value to the family during the marriage. We therefore conclude that the judge\u2019s finding that the parties never relied on the wife\u2019s interest in Pond View Associates as a financial resource during the marriage is not supported by the evidence. Consequently, paragraph 6 of the amended judgment, which excludes this property from the marital estate, must be vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\"><em>Conclusion. </em>The comprehensive Alimony Reform Act of 2011 makes important changes in our law, without unduly limiting judicial discretion so long as judges make detailed subsidiary findings of fact. The judge here faced the formidable task of applying the new law without the benefit of appellate guidance. In this case, the order dividing the marital estate under G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 34, and the order awarding general term alimony under G. L. c. 208, \u00a7\u00a7 48-55, must be reconsidered and revised in large part because the findings that might have supported such orders are absent. Paragraphs 6 and 16 of the amended judgment of divorce nisi are vacated. The case is remanded to the Probate and Family Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b550-16\">See St. 2011, c. 124, codified at G.

There also was evidence that the husband\u2019s dental practice generated declining income in 2010 and 2011 as a result of the economic recession, and that the salaries paid to the husband and his partner were lower in 2011 compared to 2010. Our inference that the judge impliedly found the husband\u2019s annual income at the time of the order to be $250,000 is based on these considerations, representations made by counsel during the oral argument, and the judge\u2019s decision to set $250,000 as the threshold for self-modification of the alimony order.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b559-6\">\u201cGeneral term alimony\u201d is defined as \u201cthe periodic payment of support to a recipient spouse who is economically dependent.\u201d G.
