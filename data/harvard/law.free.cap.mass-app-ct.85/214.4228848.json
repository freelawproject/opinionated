L. c. 110A, \u00a7 410(a)(2), tried to a jury, and a claim for unfair and deceptive trade practices, G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11, tried to a judge; both trials resulted in a judgment for the defendants. On appeal from the judgment and the denial of three posttrial motions, the plaintiff challenges a number of evidentiary rulings, the jury instructions, and the sufficiency of the evidence. In their cross appeal from the judgment, the defendants challenge the allowance of the plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary judgment that dismissed their counterclaim for breach of contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-11\">We discern no abuse of discretion or other error in the evidentiary rulings or jury instructions challenged by the plaintiff, and we see no merit in the plaintiff\u2019s argument that the evidence was insufficient. As to the defendants\u2019 claim on appeal, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>conclude that summary judgment was properly entered because the ground for the defendants\u2019 counterclaim is irreconcilable with the Supreme Judicial Court\u2019s decision in a related case, <em>Marram </em>v. <em>Kobrick Offshore Fund, Ltd., </em>442 Mass. 43 (2004) <em>(Marram I). </em>Accordingly, we affirm the judgment and the orders denying the plaintiff\u2019s posttrial motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\"><em>Background. </em>1. <em>Procedural history. </em>This dispute arises from the plaintiff\u2019s investment in the Kobrick Offshore Fund (fund), which was a \u201chedge\u201d fund<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> founded and managed by Frederick R. Kobrick (Kobrick). In particular, the parties\u2019 dispute centers on a December, 1999, meeting, and the statements Edward Mar-ram and Kobrick made then and shortly thereafter in connection with Marram\u2019s decision to invest in the fund on behalf of the Geo-Centers, Inc. Profit Sharing Plan and Trust (plan).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">In June, 2001, Marram, as trustee for the plan, sued the defendants for misrepresentation under the securities act, G. L. c. 110A, \u00a7 410(a)(2) (securities claim); negligent misrepresentation; and unfair and deceptive trade practices, G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11 (c. 93A claim). In December, 2002, a Superior Court judge dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s claims on the defendants\u2019 motion pursuant to Mass.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), 365 Mass. 754 (1974). The plaintiff appealed, and the Supreme Judicial Court vacated the dismissal of the plaintiff\u2019s complaint and remanded the case to the Superior Court. See <em>Marram </em>/, <em>supra </em>at 63.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">On remand, two claims were dismissed before trial proceedings began. A judge granted the plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the defendants\u2019 breach of contract counterclaim that sought legal fees under an indemnification clause in the parties\u2019 subscription agreement. The motion judge concluded that the indemnification clause was unenforceable as against public policy. In addition, the plaintiff dismissed its negligent misrepresentation claim. The plaintiff\u2019s remaining two claims were bifurcated for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">A jury trial was conducted on the plaintiff\u2019s securities claim from November 16 to November 30, 2009. The jury found for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>the defendants, answering a special verdict question that the defendants had made no misrepresentations. After a two-day bench trial conducted shortly thereafter, the judge made findings on the plaintiff\u2019s c. 93A claim, similarly concluding that the defendants had made no misrepresentations and committed no unfair or deceptive trade practices. After judgment entered, the plaintiff filed a series of posttrial motions: a motion for new trial, Mass.R.Civ.P. 59, 365 Mass. 827 (1974); a motion to alter or amend the findings, Mass.R.Civ.P. 52(b), as amended, 423 Mass. 1402 (1996);<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, Mass.R.Civ.P. 50(b), as amended, 428 Mass. 1402 (1998).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The trial judge denied all \u201cfor the reasons set forth in the opposition.\u201d Both the plaintiff and the defendants appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">2. <em>Trial evidence. </em>During trial, there was evidence of the following. On December 17, 1999, Marram met with Kobrick to discuss investing some of the plan\u2019s assets in the fund. As the basis of the misrepresentation claim, Marram testified that during this meeting Kobrick stated: (i) the fund was a suitable investment for the plan; (ii) the fund was diversified and invested in a variety of industries; (iii) the stock of high technology companies did not constitute a majority of the fund\u2019s holdings; and (iv) the fund would not be a volatile investment. The defendants denied that any such statements were made and countered with evidence that directly refuted the plaintiff\u2019s claims. For example, Kobrick\u2019s \u201cPowerPoint\u201d presentation at the December, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>1999, meeting stated that the fund had a \u201ccapital appreciation\u201d objective and \u201cfocus[ed] on high growth stock/sectors.\u201d Moreover, after the meeting, Kobrick arranged for the plan to receive the fund\u2019s confidential offering memorandum (offering memorandum), which disclosed among other things, that the fund was \u201cSPECULATIVE,\u201d involved a \u201cHIGH DEGREE OF RISK,\u201d and was designed to achieve \u201cabove market growth.\u201d The offering memorandum also stated that the fund: lacked diversification guidelines; may invest a significant proportion of its assets in \u201chigher growth industries, such as technology [and] telecommunications\u201d; and could engage in risky investment techniques. Marram signed the subscription agreement, certifying that he had read and understood the offering memorandum, and that he was knowledgeable and experienced in financial and business matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">Marram invested $1.5 million of the plan\u2019s assets in the fund on January 1, 2000. On March 1, 2000, Marram invested another $500,000. Soon thereafter, the stock market suffered a sharp drop and the value of the fund declined significantly. Again, the evidence showed that the parties further disputed the course of their dealings in 2000 after this market decline. The plaintiff asserted through Marram\u2019s testimony, in effect, that Kobrick made several postinvestment misrepresentations to induce the plan to keep its assets invested in the fund, specifically, that Kobrick had made the following false statements: (i) \u201cnew\u201d money was coming into the fund; (ii) the new money was primarily from other Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) investors; and (iii) the fund had sold most of its technology holdings and shorted quite a bit more in March, 2000. Additionally, Mar-ram testified that Kobrick failed to respond to Marram\u2019s request for a detailed listing of all the fund\u2019s positions.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">The defendants demonstrated through evidence, however, that \u201c[t]he [plaintiff] offered no credible evidence that any statement made by [the defendants] had any material impact on the [plaintiff\u2019s] decision to remain invested in the Fund . . . [and] the [plaintiff] remained invested in the Fund through April 2001 because of its hope that the stock market would rebound.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>Ultimately, on May 7, 2001, the plaintiff liquidated its assets in the fund for a steep loss. The plaintiff received $412,911 for its initial $1.5 million investment and $113,400 for its second $500,000 investment.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>1. <em>Plaintiff\u2019s securities claim. </em>On appeal, the plaintiff argues: (a) the judge improperly allowed the defendants to introduce evidence of Marram\u2019s investment experience, the plan\u2019s other investments, and Kobrick\u2019s investment style; (b) the jury\u2019s verdict was markedly against the weight of the evidence; (c) the judge erred in precluding testimony from the plaintiff\u2019s expert; and (d) the judge erred in instructing the jury by not clearly distinguishing between actual and constructive knowledge, and by not instructing that Marram\u2019s sophistication as an investor was irrelevant to the plaintiff\u2019s securities claim. We address each of these claims in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">a. <em>Evidence of Marram\u2019s investment experience, the plan\u2019s other investments, and Kobrick\u2019s investment style. </em>The plaintiff contends that the judge erred in allowing the defendants to introduce evidence of Marram\u2019s investment experience because such testimony related to constructive knowledge and investor sophistication, both of which, the plaintiff claims, the Supreme Judicial Court found to be irrelevant to the securities claim. See <em>Marram I, </em>442 Mass, at 53, 54 n.19. \u201cWe review a trial judge\u2019s evidentiary decisions under an abuse of discretion standard.\u201d <em>N.E. Physical Therapy Plus, Inc. </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>466 Mass. 358, 363 (2013). Here, the judge\u2019s decision to admit the evidence of Marram\u2019s investment experience was not an abuse of discretion because the plaintiff offered and stipulated to evidence that Marram was an experienced and knowledgeable investor; thus, any additional evidence on that point was merely cumulative. On direct examination Marram testified that he taught entrepreneurship at Babson College, attended Harvard University\u2019s program for owners of companies, and had familiarity with the stock market. Moreover, the plaintiff stipulated to the admission into evidence of the subscription agreement, signed by Marram, which stated that Marram had \u201csuch knowledge and experience in financial and business matters that [he] is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of the [plan\u2019s] investment.\u201d In fact, the judge warned the plaintiff\u2019s trial counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>that the broad scope of direct examination was \u201cexposing [Mar-ram] to so much cross-examination. \u201d Thus, the judge acted well within her discretion when she admitted evidence offered by the defendants on Marram\u2019s investment experience, given that such questioning was within the proper purview of cross-examination. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DeJesus, </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. 349, 352 (1998) (\u201c[T]he scope of cross-examination rests largely in the sound discretion of the trial judge\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">Further, evidence of the plan\u2019s other investments and Kobrick\u2019s prior investments in high technology stocks was offered to impeach Marram\u2019s testimony that he was seeking a more conservative investment strategy by pursuing the fund. \u201c[T]he decision to admit impeachment evidence rests in the broad discretion of the judge and will not be disturbed on appeal unless the exercise of that discretion constituted an abuse of discretion or palpable error of law.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Oliveira, </em>74 Mass. App. Ct. 49, 52 (2009). Given that the evidence of the plan\u2019s previous investments in speculative high technology stocks directly contradicted Marram\u2019s testimony that the plan was \u201cconservative\u201d and not interested in high technology stocks, we discern no abuse of discretion or error of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">Moreover, even if the plaintiff\u2019s claims of evidentiary error were valid, those errors would not have been prejudicial, see G.L. c. 231, \u00a7 119, Mass.R.Civ.P. 61, 365 Mass. 829 (1974), because the jury failed to find that the defendants had made any misrepresentations at all; therefore, the jury never reached the question of whether Marram, as trustee of the plan, knew of the falsity of any alleged misrepresentations. See <em>Marram I, supra </em>at 52 (to prevail on a claim for misrepresentation under the securities act, the plaintiff must establish that the defendant made an \u201cuntrue statement of material fact. . . [and] the plaintiff did not know of the untruth\u201d [quotation and citation omitted]). The plaintiff contends that the evidence of Marram\u2019s investment experience was admitted in error because it relates to constructive knowledge,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> which is irrelevant, as actual knowledge is required. Although the plaintiff is correct in stating that a plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>tiff\u2019s investment sophistication and the issue of constructive notice are irrelevant to establishing the elements of the securities claim, see <em>Marram </em>/, 442 Mass, at 53, 54 n.19, the jury never reached the issue of whether \u201cthe plaintiff did not know of the untruth,\u201d because the jury decided that the defendant did not make \u201cany untrue statement of a material fact.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 52. Therefore, even if such evidence was admitted in error, there was no prejudice to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">b. <em>Sufficiency of the evidence. </em>The plaintiff contends that there was evidence that Kobrick misrepresented the fund\u2019s leverage and his investment strategy and that no rational jury could have found otherwise. The plaintiff claims that in the PowerPoint presentation during the parties\u2019 December, 1999, meeting, Kobrick made a preinvestment misrepresentation that the fund was to \u201c[ujtilize moderate leverage: typical leverage long and short 1.1 to 1.4.\u201d Kobrick testified that this statement meant that the fund\u2019s objective typically was to be leveraged ten percent to forty percent long and ten percent to forty percent short, with combined leverage under eighty percent. The plaintiff argues that because the fund\u2019s combined leverage in certain months prior to the plan\u2019s investment was over eighty percent, no rational juror could have concluded that Kobrick accurately represented his investment objectives. However, the evidence at trial supports the jury\u2019s finding that Kobrick made no misrepresentation. For example, a trial exhibit summarized the fund\u2019s long and short leverage for each month from 1998, when it became operational, through December 31,1999, just before the plan\u2019s investment. This exhibit showed that the fund\u2019s combined long and short leverage never exceeded eighty percent in 1998 and exceeded eighty percent in only three months in 1999. Therefore, this exhibit \u2014 to which the plaintiff stipulated \u2014 showed that it was indeed typical for the fund\u2019s combined leverage to be under eighty percent.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">The plaintiff also argues that, in the same PowerPoint presentation described above, Kobrick claimed to invest in companies based on an investigation of each company\u2019s management and that such claims amounted to a misrepresentation because of the fund\u2019s frequent level of trading and day trading.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> However, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>Kobrick testified that there was no inconsistency between frequent trading positions in a particular company to maximize gains and the fundamentals of initially selecting that company\u2019s stock. Moreover, the offering memorandum stated that \u201c[t]he investment strategy of the Fund will involve the taking of frequent trading positions.\u201d Thus, contrary to the plaintiff\u2019s assertions, the jury\u2019s verdict was well supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">c. <em>Plaintiff\u2019s expert witness. </em>The plaintiff claims error in the trial judge\u2019s decision to \u201cpreclude\u201d the testimony of the plaintiff\u2019s expert, E. Stephens Scales. The judge, however, did not preclude Scales from testifying; after voir dire, she deferred a final decision on his qualification until the conclusion of Kobrick\u2019s testimony. Ultimately, the plaintiff never called Scales to testify. The plaintiff contends that it was justified in concluding that Scales would not be allowed to testify because the judge deemed Scales not qualified to testify as to the issue for which he was offered, namely, the fund\u2019s preinvestment trading activity, thus chilling the plaintiff\u2019s decision to call Scales as a witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">Even if the judge had precluded Scales from testifying, such a decision would not constitute an abuse of discretion or other error of law. See <em>Palandjian </em>v. <em>Foster, </em>446 Mass. 100, 104 (2006) (\u201cThe decision to exclude expert testimony rests in the broad discretion of the trial judge and will not be disturbed unless the exercise of that discretion constitutes an abuse of discretion or other error of law\u201d). During voir dire, Scales testified he was a former stock broker who had worked for various brokerage firms for over twenty years. Scales also revealed that he had never testified in any court as an expert witness; he had never managed any kind of investment fund, including a hedge fund; and he had no present license relating to securities since his broker\u2019s license had expired when he retired in 2003. \u201cThe crucial issue in determining whether a witness is qualified to give an expert opinion is whether the witness has sufficient education, training, experience and familiarity with the subject matter of the testimony.\u201d <em>Matter of the Trusts Under the Will of Crabtree, </em>449 Mass. 128, 152 (2007) (quotations and citation omitted). Given Scales\u2019s lack of expertise in investment and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>hedge funds, if the judge had precluded Scales from testifying, we would conclude that the judge had not abused her discretion or committed an error of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">d. <em>Jury instructions. </em>The plaintiff argues the judge erred in instructing the jury by (1) not clearly distinguishing between actual and constructive knowledge, and (2) not instructing that Marram\u2019s sophistication as an investor was irrelevant. \u201cWhen reviewing jury instructions to which there has been an objection, we conduct a two-part test: \u2018whether the instructions were legally erroneous, and (if so) whether that error was prejudicial.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kelly </em>v. <em>Foxboro Realty Assocs., LLC, </em>454 Mass. 306, 310 (2009), quoting from <em>Masingill </em>v. <em>EMC Corp., </em>449 Mass. 532, 540 n.20 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">The plaintiff correctly notes that in <em>Marram I, </em>442 Mass, at 54 n.19, the Supreme Judicial Court held that the plaintiff\u2019s constructive \u2014\u2022 as opposed to actual \u2014 knowledge, if any, of the falsity of any alleged misrepresentation is irrelevant to its claim. Accordingly, the judge so instructed the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-7\">\u201cThe plaintiff may not recover if the [plaintiff] actually knew the misrepresentation was false. . . . [a]ctual knowledge is required. The plaintiff must have actual knowledge that the misrepresentation was not \u2014 was untrue. It is not enough for you to determine that the plaintiff should have known that it was untrue. You must find that the plaintiff actually knew that the misrepresentation was untrue.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b255-8\">The judge clearly instructed the jury that actual knowledge was required. Contrary to the plaintiff\u2019s assertion, the judge\u2019s instruction was consistent with the Supreme Judicial Court\u2019s decision in <em>Marram </em>/, and therefore correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-9\">As to the plaintiff\u2019s second claim of error, although the plaintiff correctly notes that evidence of a plaintiff\u2019s investment sophistication is not relevant to proof of the securities claim, see <em>Marram I, supra </em>at 53, \u201c[e]very possible correct statement of law need not ... be included in jury instructions if the instructions as given are correct and touch on the fundamental elements of the claim.\u201d <em>Kobayashi </em>v. <em>Orion Ventures, Inc., </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. 492, 503 (1997). (Such evidence however remains <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>relevant and admissible for other purposes, e.g., as discussed above, for impeachment.) Further, even if it was error for the judge to decline such an instruction, there was no prejudice to the plaintiff because, as noted above, the jury never reached the question of knowledge. See G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 119; Mass.R.Civ.P. 61.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">2. <em>Plaintiff\u2019s c. 93A claim. </em>The plaintiff argues that the judge\u2019s decision in favor of the defendants on the plaintiff\u2019s c. 93A claim is not supported by the evidence of both the preinvestment and postinvestment misrepresentations.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> This argument is unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">As discussed introductorily, after the jury found for the defendants on the plaintiff\u2019s securities claim, the judge found for the defendants on the plaintiff\u2019s c. 93A claim. In reviewing a matter wherein the trial judge was the finder of fact, \u201c[t]he findings of fact ... are accepted unless they are clearly erroneous [] [and] [w]e review the judge\u2019s legal conclusions de nova.\u201d <em>T.W. Nickerson, Inc. </em>v. <em>Fleet Natl. Bank, </em>456 Mass. 562, 569 (2010) (citations omitted). See Mass.R.Civ.P. 52(a), as amended, 423 Mass. 1402 (1996) (rule 52[a]). \u201cA finding is \u2018clearly erroneous\u2019 when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>Springgate </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Mattapoisett, </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. 304, 309-310 (1981), quoting from <em>United States </em>v. <em>United States Gypsum Co., </em>333 U.S. 364, 395 (1948). Moreover, \u201c[i]n applying the \u2018clearly erroneous\u2019 standard, rule 52(a) requires that \u2018due regard shall be given to the opportunity of the trial court to judge of the credibility of the witnesses.\u2019 \u201d <em>Demoulas </em>v. <em>Demoulas Super Mkts., Inc., </em>424 Mass. 501, 509 (1997). Therefore, \u201c[s]o long as the judge\u2019s account is plausible in light of the entire record, an appellate court should decline to reverse it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 510.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">As to the alleged preinvestment misrepresentations,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>found, similar to the jury, that the defendants made no preinvestment misrepresentations. Specifically, the judge discredited Marram\u2019s testimony that Kobrick made the alleged misrepresentations because Marram\u2019s testimony was impeached by other evidence. For example, although the plaintiff asserts that Kobrick misrepresented the fund\u2019s volatility, the offering memorandum disclosed that the fund was \u201cSPECULATIVE\u201d and involved a \u201cHIGH DEGREE OF RISK.\u201d Moreover, the judge credited Kobrick\u2019s testimony that he never stated the fund was \u201csuitable\u201d for the plan. The judge also noted that Marram conceded that he had never asked Kobrick how much of the fund constituted high technology stocks. \u201c[T]he judge\u2019s assessment of the quality of the testimony is entitled to our considerable respect because \u2018it is the trial judge who, by virtue of [her] firsthand view of the presentation of evidence, is in the best position to judge the weight and credibility of the evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Edinburg </em>v. <em>Edinburg, </em>22 Mass. App. Ct. 199, 203 (1986), quoting from <em>New England Canteen Serv., Inc. </em>v. <em>Ashley, </em>372 Mass. 671, 675 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">The judge also found that Kobrick made no postinvestment misrepresentations. In her conclusions of law, the judge stated that the \u201cinescapable conclusion ... is that the Plan remained invested in the Fund not because of Kobrick\u2019s promises or assurances, but because it hoped that the downturn in the stock market would resolve itself and provide the Plan with future positive returns.\u201d Like her decision regarding the lack of preinvestment misrepresentation, the judge discredited Marram\u2019s testimony since it was contradicted by other evidence. For example, contrary to the plaintiff\u2019s assertion that no new money was invested in the fund, the fund actually received almost $24.5 million in new investments during 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">In sum, the plaintiff\u2019s argument that the judge\u2019s decision on the plaintiff\u2019s c. 93A claim is not supported by the evidence rests heavily on Marram\u2019s testimony, which the judge specifically discredited. \u201cThe judge\u2019s advantage in weighing the testimony is particularly evident in a case involving conflicting testimony, \u2018one in which widely differing inferences could be drawn from the evidence,\u2019 and the drawing of inferences cannot be separated from the evaluation of the testimony itself.\u201d <em>Demoulas </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>v. <em>Demoulas Super Mkts., Inc., supra </em>at 510, quoting from <em>Goddard </em>v. <em>Dupree, </em>322 Mass. 247, 248 (1948). \u201c[W]here there are two permissible views of the evidence, the factfinder\u2019s choice between them cannot be clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Edinburg </em>v. <em>Edinburg, supra </em>at 203, quoting from <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Bessemer City, </em>470 U.S. 564, 574 (1985). As the plaintiff has not demonstrated that any of the judge\u2019s findings are clearly erroneous, and as those findings support the judge\u2019s ruling on the c. 93A claim, we reject the plaintiff\u2019s argument that the judge\u2019s ruling is not supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">3. <em>Defendants\u2019 counterclaim for legal fees. </em>In their counterclaim for breach of contract, the defendants sought to recover legal fees under section VIII(D) of the subscription agreement (indemnification clause).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Before trial, the motion judge granted the plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the defendants\u2019 counterclaim, ruling that both subsections (a) and (b) of the indemnification clause were unenforceable as against public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">\u201cAn order granting or denying summary judgment will be upheld if the [motion] judge ruled on undisputed material facts and his ruling was correct as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Anderson St. Assocs. </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>442 Mass. 812, 816 (2004), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>One 1987 Mercury Cougar Auto., </em>413 Mass. 534, 536 (1992). We see no error in the grant of summary judgment because the specific ground for legal fees advanced by the defendants in this case directly contradicts the decision in <em>Mar-ram I.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">a. <em>Subsection (a) of indemnification clause. </em>Subsection (a) of the indemnification clause holds the plaintiff liable for the defendants\u2019 legal fees arising out of \u201cany false representation or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>warranty or breach or failure by the [plaintiff] to comply with any covenant or agreement made by the [plaintiff] herein.\u201d The motion judge concluded that, pursuant to this subsection, even if the defendants had made misrepresentations sufficient to constitute a securities act violation, the plaintiff would have to still pay the defendants\u2019 legal fees and thereby \u201close by winning.\u201d The judge reasoned that such a result would \u201cfly in the face\u201d of the Supreme Judicial Court\u2019s decision in <em>Marram I. </em>Based on <em>Marram I </em>and the securities act\u2019s strong protections for buyers of securities, the motion judge determined that it would be \u201ccontrary to public policy and to the legislative purpose and spirit of the [securities act] to enforce provisions in the Subscription Agreement which would permit the [defendants] to recover damages even if they committed a violation of the act.\u201d We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">In their counterclaim, the defendants alleged that the plaintiff breached the subscription agreement by bringing a securities act claim based on <em>oral </em>misrepresentations because the plaintiff had warranted in the subscription agreement that it had relied solely on <em>written </em>documents in deciding whether to invest.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Based on this alleged breach, the defendants sought legal fees pursuant to subsection (a) of the indemnification clause, which states the plaintiff is liable for litigation expenses arising out of \u201cany false representation or warranty . . . made by the [plaintiff]\u201d in the subscription agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">The defendant\u2019s breach of contract counterclaim is in direct conflict with <em>Marram </em>/, as that decision expressly allowed the plaintiff\u2019s securities claim to proceed based on alleged oral representations. In <em>Marram </em>/, 442 Mass, at 55-57, the Supreme Judicial Court determined that a claim under G. L. c. 110A, \u00a7 410(a)(2), may proceed based on oral misrepresentations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>despite a contractual integration clause.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Thus, the defendants cannot claim a breach of the subscription agreement by the plaintiff because the plaintiff proceeded with the very claim allowed by <em>Marram I.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">We now know that the plaintiff\u2019s securities claim was unsuccessful at trial. However, theoretically, from the perspective of the motion judge, if the plaintiff had succeeded on its securities claim, but the defendants\u2019 counterclaim for breach of contract also was successful, under the literal terms of subsection (a) of the indemnification clause, the plaintiff would be liable for the defendants\u2019 legal fees. Thus, the motion judge correctly observed that if the defendants prevailed on their counterclaim for breach of contract, it was possible for the plaintiff to \u201close by winning.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">As the defendants\u2019 breach of contract counterclaim based on subsection (a) of the indemnification clause sought to hold the plaintiff liable for its breach of the subscription agreement without limitation as to the defendants\u2019 violation of the securities act, even though G. L. c. 110A, \u00a7 410(/), would ultimately bar the defendants from recovering under subsection (a) if the plaintiff\u2019s securities claim was successful, the defendants\u2019 counterclaim was still untenable. Consequently, the motion judge was correct in granting summary judgment on the counterclaim insofar as it rested on subsection (a), as <em>Marram I </em>foreclosed the defendant\u2019s argument for indemnification based on the plaintiff\u2019s alleged breach of contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">b. <em>Subsection (b) of the indemnification clause. </em>Subsection (b) holds the plaintiff liable for the defendants\u2019 legal fees arising out of \u201cany action for securities law violations instituted by the [plaintiff] which is finally resolved by judgment against the [plaintiff].\u201d Once again, the motion judge determined that this subsection of the indemnification clause was unenforceable as against public policy. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">Whether the enforcement of such an indemnification clause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>violates public policy remains an issue of uncertainty in Massachusetts, given the dearth of appellate guidance on this issue. We may, however, turn to Federal case law interpreting the Federal Securities Act of 1933. See <em>Marram I, </em>442 Mass, at 50-51. See also G. L. c. 110A, \u00a7 415 (stating that \u201cchapter [110A] shall be so construed as ... to coordinate the interpretation and administration of this chapter with the related federal regulation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">Despite the defendants\u2019 contention that the Federal courts are in agreement that such clauses do not violate public policy, the Federal District courts are divided on the issue. Compare <em>Doody </em>v. <em>E.F Hutton &amp; Co., </em>587 F. Supp. 829, 833 (D. Minn. 1984) <em>(Doody) </em>(\u201cThe Court finds that enforcing an indemnity provision . . . would discourage prospective plaintiffs from bringing securities fraud actions whenever there is an integration clause in a subscription agreement. . . because the plaintiffs would be running the risk of incurring substantial liability for attorneys\u2019 fees and costs\u201d), with <em>Zissu </em>v. <em>Bear, Stearns &amp; Co., </em>627 F. Supp. 687, 692-694 (S.D.N.Y.) <em>(Zissu I) </em>(\u201cEnforcing the indemnification provision . . . need not deter . . . investors from bringing suits to enforce their rights under the securities laws. The only potential chilling effect is on those investors who make representations in a subscription agreement which they later repudiate. . . . Where an investor repudiates warranties previously made for the purpose of bringing a suit, enforcement of the indemnification clause comports with existing policies of the securities laws\u201d), aff\u2019d on other grounds, 805 F.2d 75, 78-80 (2d Cir. 1986) <em>(Zissu </em>77);<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>Barnebey </em>v. <em>E.F. Hutton &amp; Co., </em>715 F. Supp. 1512, 1522 (M.D. Fla. 1989) (rejecting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number><em>Doody, supra, </em>and \u201cfinding] the reasoning of <em>[Zissu 1, supra,] </em>to be more persuasive on the issue of public policy\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">We note that under Massachusetts law, courts must proceed with caution when determining whether a contract must be voided due to public policy. See <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Cotter, </em>448 Mass. 671, 683 (2007) (\u201c[C]ourts are hesitant to invalidate contracts on . . . public policy grounds .... The grounds for a public policy exception must be clear in the acts of the Legislature or the decisions of this court\u201d). Nonetheless, in our view, the motion judge properly concluded that the enforcement of a \u201closer pays\u201d indemnification clause in the securities fraud context is against public policy because, as <em>Marram I, </em>442 Mass, at 51-54, made clear, the securities act is highly protective of buyers of securities. Cf. <em>Huffington </em>v. <em>T.C. Group, LLC, </em>685 F. Supp. 2d 239, 243 (D. Mass. 2010), aff\u2019d, 627 F.3d 18 (2011). We recognize, however, that in <em>Marram I, supra </em>at 44, the indemnification clause was neither raised nor discussed, and the court\u2019s decision was limited to the review of a grant of a motion to dismiss. Still, we determine that, in interpreting and analyzing the elements for a claim under G. L. c. 110A, \u00a7 410(a)(2), <em>Marram I </em>made clear that Massachusetts public policy is protective of investors. See <em>Welch </em>v. <em>Barach, </em>84 Mass. App. Ct. 113, 119 (2013), quoting from <em>Marram I, supra </em>at 51 (\u201cAn important purpose of \u00a7 410(a)(2) is the creation of a \u2018strong incentive for sellers of securities to disclose fully all material facts about the security\u2019 and of a \u2018heightened deterrent\u2019 against misrepresentation and omission\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">Thus, Massachusetts policy seems at odds with those Federal courts that have upheld indemnification clauses under the Federal securities act. For example, the leading Federal court case for the proposition that indemnification clauses do not violate the public policy of the Federal securities act is <em>Zissu I. </em>In that case, the plaintiff lost on his Federal securities act. claims and the defendants prevailed on their counterclaim for breach of warranty. <em>Zissu I, </em>627 F. Supp. at 689, 690-691. The breach of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>warranty counterclaim asserted that the plaintiff\u2019s lawsuit for securities fraud was based on allegations that were contrary to the plaintiff\u2019s representations in the parties\u2019 subscription agreement; specifically, the plaintiff\u2019s representations that he understood the investment was speculative with a high degree of risk, that he was not relying on any representations other than those in the private offering memorandum, that he had carefully reviewed that memorandum and the subscription agreement, and that he was capable of calculating the risks of the investment. <em>Id. </em>at 692-693. When the defendants in <em>Zissu I </em>prevailed on their counterclaim for breach of warranty, which is comparable to the defendants\u2019 counterclaim for breach of contract in the case before us, the <em>Zissu I </em>defendants were awarded attorney\u2019s fees under the indemnification provision in the parties\u2019 agreement. <em>Zissu I, supra </em>at 690-691. The <em>Zissu I </em>plaintiff filed a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, arguing that enforcement of the indemnification clause violated public policy because it would discourage investors from bringing claims. <em>Id. </em>at 692-693. The Federal District Court judge disagreed and found that the indemnification clause did not violate public policy and that any chilling effect was desirable and appropriate. He stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-5\">\u201cThe only potential chilling effect is on those investors who make representations in a subscription agreement which they later repudiate. It would discourage such investors from using their own fraudulent conduct in order to bring unjustified lawsuits.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b263-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 693. As the motion judge in the case before us noted, citing to <em>Marram I, </em>\u201cthe very claims that, according to <em>Zissu [I], </em>never should have been brought are claims that state a cause of action under G. L. c. 110A, \u00a7 410(a)(2).\u201d In <em>Marram </em>/, 442 Mass, at 55, the court specifically rejected the defendants\u2019 argument they were \u201cimmune from the plaintiff\u2019s claims because . . . Marram\u2019s sophistication and equal bargaining power are relevant to the applicability of the integration clause.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">Further, in <em>Zissu I, </em>627 F. Supp. at 693, the judge went on to state that \u201cnot only is enforcement of this indemnification clause not contrary to securities law policies, but the securities laws <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>authorize courts to award attorneys\u2019 fees on these facts.\u201d In support of this statement, the judge noted that \u201c[sjection 11(e) of the 1933 [Securities] Act[, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77k(e),] provides that courts may award costs and reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees if the plaintiff\u2019s suit is without merit.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>In contrast, as noted by the motion judge in the case before us, the Massachusetts securities act has no such corresponding provision.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In fact, under the Massachusetts act, only the plaintiff investor may be awarded attorney\u2019s fees and only if the plaintiff prevails. G. L. c. 110A, \u00a7 410(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">Consequently, it appears that Massachusetts public policy aligns with the public policy of the Federal securities act advanced by those Federal District Courts that have refused to enforce indemnification provisions. For instance, in <em>Doody, </em>587 F. Supp. at 831, the defendant seller of securities advanced counterclaims nearly identical to those advanced in this case, namely, that the plaintiffs breached their warranties by suing the defendant for securities fraud based on oral misrepresentations. Like the present case, the plaintiffs in <em>Doody </em>\u201cwarranted, at the time of entering into the transactions, that they were not relying on any representations other than those contained in the prospectus.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Thus, like the defendants here, the defendants in <em>Doody, </em>claimed they were entitled to attorney\u2019s fees and costs because the plaintiffs breached their warranties. See <em>ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">However, unlike <em>Marram I, Doody </em>addressed both the indemnification clause and the integration clause. Ultimately, the court in <em>Doody, supra </em>at 833, determined that the indemnification provision was unenforceable as it violated public policy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-7\">\u201cThe Court finds that enforcing an indemnity provision such as the one in the instant action would discourage prospective plaintiffs from bringing securities fraud actions whenever there is an integration clause in a subscription agreement. Prospective plaintiffs would be discouraged because the plaintiffs would be running the risk of incurring substantial liability for attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number><em>Since the securities laws are a remedial measure intended to encourage the prosecution of securities fraud actions, the Court refuses to enforce this indemnity </em>provision\u201d (emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">The Supreme Judicial Court cited a segment of this exact language in <em>Marram 1, </em>442 Mass, at 57, as support for the proposition that an integration clause \u201ccannot be construed to waive the plaintiff\u2019s rights under Federal or State securities law.\u201d Importantly, the public policy relied on by the <em>Doody </em>court to hold the indemnity provision unenforceable is similar to the public policy of the Massachusetts securities act as expressed in <em>Marram I. </em>In <em>Marram I, supra </em>at 51, the court noted that \u201c[t]he statute\u2019s thrust is both \u2018redressive\u2019 and \u2018preventive[,]\u2019 . . . [and] it creates a strong incentive for sellers of securities to disclose fully all material facts about the security.\u201d Likewise, the <em>Doody </em>court, in holding that the indemnity clause was unenforceable, noted that \u201csecurities laws are a remedial measure intended to encourage the prosecution of securities fraud actions.\u201d <em>Doody, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">Further, in <em>Huffington </em>v. <em>T. C. Group, LLC, </em>685 F. Supp. 2d at 244, the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts refused to nullify a contractual forum selection clause on public policy grounds because, \u201c[w]hile the <em>[.Marram </em>7] opinion does reflect the Massachusetts public policy of protecting investors, that policy is not implicated by forcing Huffing-ton to litigate in Delaware.\u201d By contrast, in this case, the parties\u2019 indemnification clause, which holds the plaintiff liable if it loses its securities claim, <em>does </em>implicate the public policy of protecting investors. As the motion judge in the case before us stated, such \u201closer pays\u201d indemnification clauses \u201cwould discourage all but the most confident investors from invoking the protection of the Act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\"><em>Conclusion. </em>For the reasons discussed above, we affirm the judgment and the orders denying the plaintiff\u2019s posttrial motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b248-9\">A \u201chedge\u201d fund is \u201ca specialized investment group \u2014\u25a0 [usually] organized as a limited partnership or offshore investment company \u2014 that offers the possibility of high returns through risky techniques such as selling short or buying derivatives.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 727 (9th ed. 2009).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b249-6\">The plaintiff\u2019s motion to alter or amend the findings concerned the judge\u2019s decision on the plaintiff\u2019s c. 93A claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b249-7\">The judge denied the plaintiff\u2019s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV) for the reasons stated in the defendants\u2019 opposition, which correctly asserted that the issues raised in the JNOV motion were waived by the plaintiff having failed to present them specifically in its directed verdict motion.

Although neither reached the question of whether such indemnification clauses violate public policy, as the specificity issue was dispositive in both cases, such a conclusion regarding specificity would be inconsistent with a determination that the indemnification clauses are unenforceable.
