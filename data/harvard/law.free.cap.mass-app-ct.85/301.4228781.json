L. c. 161A, \u00a7 24, in fiscal years 2009 and 2010.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The property in question is the South Station Headhouse (Headhouse), which the MBTA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>leases to Beacon South Station Associates, LSE (Beacon), also known as EOP-South Station, LLC (EOF).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Headhouse consists of an enclosed concourse through which the public passes to access MBTA and Amtrak train platforms, an underground subway connection, office and retail space, a surface facility and parking area, and the surrounding sidewalks. The real estate taxes assessed on the Headhouse were $1,439,974.76 in 2009, and $1,135,463.55 in 2010. EOF filed challenges to the 2009 and 2010 fiscal year assessments on the property with the board of assessors of Boston (assessors), and then appealed to the Appellate Tax Board (board) following the assessors\u2019 refusal to abate the taxes. The board ruled that G. L. c. 161A, \u00a7 24, \u201cexpressly exempted the property of the MBTA from taxation, whether or not leased for business purposes,\u201d and granted the abatements. The assessors appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">On appeal, the assessors\u2019 primary argument is that the board erred in its conclusion, and the \u00a7 24 exemption did not apply to the Headhouse at all because EOF, a private entity, leased the Headhouse from the MBTA and operated it for profit in the tax years in question. Alternatively, the assessors argue that even if the Headhouse was not subject to a blanket assessment for the years in question, EOF could be taxed on the tenant improvements made to the property because EOF owned these improvements according to the terms of the lease, and they were therefore not property of the MBTA. Examination of G. L. c. 161, \u00a7 24, as in effect in 2009 and 2010, its legislative purpose, and the case law interpreting the statute compel us to conclude that no part of the property was subject to taxation in 2009 or 2010, and we therefore affirm the decision of the board abating the taxes for those years.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\"><em>Background. </em>The stipulated factual record is replete with evidence detailing the financial hardships of both South Station and the MBTA. We begin with a brief summary of the history of South Station and how the plans to revitalize it were intended to benefit the ailing MBTA.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>Following the increase in air and highway travel after World War II, and through the 1970s, the use of South Station steadily declined and the property deteriorated as a result.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Although the Boston Redevelopment Authority (BRA), after purchasing South Station in 1965, originally concluded that it was \u201cinfeasible of economic conversion for a better use,\u201d the BRA, along with Federal, State, and local agencies, eventually reconsidered and determined that South Station could become a transportation hub and multiuse complex. South Station was reimagined as a \u201cpublic meeting place\u201d that would include office and retail space and a \u201cgrand and spacious\u201d concourse for intra- and intercity travelers and commuters.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">As a result, the BRA conveyed South Station to the MBTA in 1979. The MBTA began a $195 million renovation and restoration of the Headhouse in 1984. Funding for this restoration was provided by the MBTA, Amtrak, the Urban Mass Transit Authority, the Federal Railroad Administration, private development corporations, and EOP\u2019s predecessor, Beacon.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">In 1988, to advance the revitalization plans, the MBTA entered into a long-term lease agreement with Beacon, pursuant to which Beacon agreed to expend a substantial amount of money to renovate and operate the property, and in turn, to earn and share revenue by leasing space to subtenants. Beacon provided $22 million to finance the renovation, supervised the rehabilitation of the Headhouse, and provided property management services for the MBTA. The lease \u201cwas not intended to be a conventional, profit-making commercial real estate lease, but rather a lease to provide a public service as well as to offset the cost of redeveloping and operating the facility.\u201d The initial term of the lease expires on December 31, 2024. The lease also contains an option for two fifteen-year extensions. Although the MBTA retains ownership of the land and the Headhouse, the lease specifies that Beacon \u2014 now EOP \u2014 retains title to any and all tenant improvements, but any such improvements not removed at the end of the lease term become property of the MBTA. \u201cTenant\u2019s Improvements\u201d are defined in the lease as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>\u201cAny and all appurtenances, furnishings, fixtures, equipment, improvements, additions and other property attached to or installed in the Premises by or on behalf of Tenant, including, without limitation, Tenant\u2019s Work, any and all Tenant Alterations[<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>] and any and all appurtenances, furnishing, trade or other fixtures, equipment, improvements, additions and other property installed by or for the use or benefit of any and all Subtenants.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">The renovation of the Headhouse, completed in 1989, included interior improvements, with retail and food kiosks on the first floor and office space on the upper floors.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">Under the lease, EOP\u2019s rental payments to the META are either the greater of (i) a minimum guaranteed rent of $330,000 per year, or (ii) fifty percent of the difference between net available income (as defined in the lease) and the annual capital improvement contribution. The lease also provides that real estate taxes are deducted from the net available income in calculating the annual rent due.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">Since 1990, real estate taxes have been assessed on the entirety of the Headhouse. In addition to the various for-profit sublessees that occupy the private retail and office space, both Amtrak and the Commonwealth also sublet office space during the tax years at issue. As explained above, the total real estate taxes for 2009 and 2010 were $1,439,974.76 and $1,135,463.55, respectively. The parties stipulated below that the rental payments to the META would have been greater if the property had not been subject to real estate taxes. For example, in 2009, FOP would have paid $791,936.71, instead of the $330,000 minimum.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In issuing its decision on the 2009 and 2010 abatements, the board emphasized that FOP paid significantly less rent to the META than it would have if taxes had not been assessed.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">Although the South Station revitalization was successful, the META continues to face grave financial difficulties, including substantial debt. As of early 2011, this debt totaled $5.5 billion.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number><em>Discussion. </em>1. <em>Standard of review. </em>\u201cAt the outset it should be noted that an exemption from taxation is a matter of legislative grace and may be recognized only when the taxpayer shows that he comes within either the express words or the necessary implication of some statute conferring this privilege upon him.\u201d <em>Assessors of Newton </em>v. <em>Pickwick Ltd., </em>351 Mass. 621, 623 (1967) <em>(Pickwick). </em>See <em>Boston Chamber of Commerce </em>v. <em>Assessors of Boston, </em>315 Mass. 712, 716 (1944); <em>Willowdale LLC </em>v. <em>Assessors of Topsfield, </em>78 Mass. App. Ct. 767, 769 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">2. <em>Statutory scheme and MBTA exemption. </em>In 2009 and 2010, the MBTA exemption statute, G. L. c. 161A, \u00a7 24, inserted by St. 1999, c. 127, \u00a7 151, provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-6\">\u201cNotwithstanding any general or special law to the contrary, the [MBTA] and all its real and personal property shall be exempt from taxation and from betterments and special assessments; and the [MBTA] shall not be required to pay any tax, excise or assessment to or for the commonwealth or any of its political subdivisions . . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">As the board recognized, by its plain terms the statutory exemption applied to all of the property at issue without regard to whether or for what purpose the property was leased. See <em>White </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>428 Mass. 250, 253 (1998) (courts are constrained to follow statute\u2019s plain language). There was no exception carved out of the \u00a7 24 exemption for private leases. Moreover, during the years at issue, \u00a7 24 expressly provided that the property of the MBTA shall be exempt from taxation \u201c[notwithstanding any general or special law to the contrary.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-9\">\u201c[Rjeal estate owned in fee or otherwise or held in trust for the benefit of the United States, the commonwealth, or a county, city or town, or any instrumentality thereof, if used in connection with a business conducted for profit or leased or occupied for other than public purposes, shall for the privilege of such use, lease or occupancy, be valued, classified, assessed and taxed annually as of January first to the user, lessee or occupant in the same manner and to the same extent as if such user, lessee or occupant were the owner thereof in fee, whether or not there is any agreement by such user, lessee or occupant to pay taxes assessed under this section.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>The Legislature employs the \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d language to trump the effect of other potentially inconsistent statutes. In this instance it trumped the effect of G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 2B, the general tax statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">3. <em>Prior case law interpreting private leases. </em>We also have specific guidance from the Supreme Judicial Court on the issue of the taxability of MBTA leases to private parties. In <em>Pickwick, </em>351 Mass, at 623-625, the Supreme Judicial Court addressed this question while construing substantially similar statutory language in the predecessors to the MBTA exemption statute and the general public property taxation statute in effect in 2009 and 2010.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The court interpreted the exemption statute to \u201cencompass all the [MBTA\u2019s] real and personal property,\u201d including any property leased from the MBTA by a private, commercial entity, regardless of the purpose for which that property was used. <em>Id. </em>at 624. The court emphasized that the Legislature\u2019s purpose in establishing the exemption was to alleviate the ailing transportation authority\u2019s \u201ccrushing financial burden.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 626. Consistent with that purpose, the court adopted an interpretation of the exemption that included lessees. <em>Ibid. </em>\u201cIf the exemption did not include lessees of the authority, the lessee . . . could reduce its rental payments to the authority by the amount of the tax. . . . Such a construction would completely negate the legislative intent . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 624-625. See <em>Martha\u2019s Vineyard Land Bank Commn. </em>v. <em>Assessors of W. Tisbury, </em>62 Mass. App. Ct. 25, 32 (2004), quoting from <em>Pickwick, </em>351 Mass, at 624-626 (\u201ctax exemption that \u2018primarily benefits]\u2019 the public by improving the authority\u2019s finances had to be liberally read to extend the exemption to the authority\u2019s lessees \u2018by necessary implication,\u2019 so as to prevent dissipation of the authority\u2019s revenues by having the lessees reduce their rental payments by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>the amount of any tax, because \u2018[t]he [authority\u2019s] public purpose is of controlling significance in construing [the] express exemption from taxation\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">In an attempt to circumvent <em>Pickwick, </em>the assessors claim that the holding in that case was effectively overruled before the tax years at issue here by subsequent amendments to the general tax statute. We are not persuaded by this argument. As the court stated in <em>Pickwick, </em>the specific MBTA exemption statute controls over the general tax law. <em>Pickwick, </em>351 Mass, at 625-626. See <em>Cabot </em>v. <em>Assessors of Boston, </em>335 Mass. 53, 63-65 (1956). See generally <em>TBI, Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Health of N. Andover, </em>431 Mass. 9, 18 (2000), quoting from <em>Risk Mgmt. Foundation of Harvard Med. Insts., Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>407 Mass 498,505 (1990) (\u201cIt is a basic canon of statutory interpretation that \u2018general statutory language must yield to that which is more specific\u2019 \u201d). Had the Legislature wished to limit the exemption after <em>Pickwick, </em>it would have had to have done so more expressly and more directly than the changes in the general tax statute relied on by the assessors. Cf. G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 5, Second; St. 1956, c. 465, \u00a7 17, as amended through St. 1980, c. 497, \u00a7\u00a7 1-3. See also <em>Commissioner of Rev. </em>v. <em>Cargill, Inc., </em>429 Mass. 79, 82 (1999) (\u201cHad the Legislature intended to limit the credit in the manner advocated by the commissioner, it easily could have done so\u201d). Despite the various changes to the general tax statute in the years since <em>Pickwick, </em>the MBTA exemption statute had been amended only once, in 1999, prior to the tax years in question. See St. 1999, c. 127, \u00a7 151. Rather than undermining <em>Pickwick, </em>this amendment added the prefatory clause, \u201c[notwithstanding any general or special law to the contrary.\u201d This amendment, as previously explained, reinforces the specific MBTA exemption by its plain language, evincing the legislative intent that this particular exemption supersedes any other implicated general tax statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">Finally, we note that the Legislature, in 2013, expressly amended the MBTA exemption statute as part of a comprehensive transportation funding overhaul, adding language specifically excluding lessees from the scope of the MBTA exemption if the property is \u201cleased, used, or occupied in connection with a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>business conducted for profit.\u201d St. 2013, c. 46, \u00a7 50.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> This change, explicitly narrowing the exemption, reinforces the conclusion that there was a preexisting exemption from taxation for lessees for prior tax years. See <em>Brooks </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Gloucester, </em>5 Mass. App. Ct. 158, 161 (1977) (\u201can amendment to a statute presumably intends a change\u201d to that statute).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">In light of the foregoing, we conclude that the board correctly applied the statutory tax exemption to the leased property in 2009 and 2010.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">4. <em>Tenant improvements. </em>In the alternative, the assessors argue that because the tenant improvements are privately owned according to the terms of the lease \u2014 a fact that distinguishes this case from <em>Pickwick </em>\u2014 these improvements are subject to real estate taxes as private property. According to the assessors, the statutory exemption cannot cover the tenant improvements because EOF has title to these improvements, and thus they do not constitute real or personal property of the MBTA.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> As an initial matter, it is not clear from the record that the assessors raised this issue before the board, and the board, therefore, did not squarely address this issue in its decision. Even if properly raised below, the argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">Real estate taxes are usually assessed on land and buildings as a unit. Cf. <em>Franklin </em>v. <em>Metcalfe, </em>307 Mass. 386, 389 (1940), and cases cited; <em>Ellis </em>v. <em>Assessors of Acushnet, </em>358 Mass. 473, 475 (1970) (\u201cThe law is well settled that land and buildings erected thereon or affixed thereto are properly taxed as a unit and this rule is not affected by private agreements or by the degree of physical attachment to the land\u201d). As the board found, there is no dispute that the land and buildings comprising South Station are owned by the MBTA. They were conveyed to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>MBTA by the BRA in 1979. They are real property of the MBTA and, without any showing to the contrary, exempt from taxation. See G. L. c. 161A, \u00a7 24. And, as we concluded above, for fiscal years 2009 and 2010, the Headhouse cannot be taxed simply because it is leased to a private party, as the property is owned by the MBTA and thus subject to the exemption statute and the interpretation of that statute in <em>Pickwick, </em>351 Mass, at 623-624.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">The assessors, therefore, ask us to carve out the tenant improvements from otherwise tax-exempt property, and to tax those improvements as real estate. We are not persuaded by this argument, as we discern no authority to impose real estate taxes on tenant improvements where the rest of the property \u2014 the land and the building itself \u25a0\u2014 is plainly exempt. Cf. <em>Franklin </em>v. <em>Metcalfe, </em>307 Mass, at 389; <em>Ellis </em>v. <em>Assessors of Acushnet, </em>358 Mass, at 475. In fact, the assessors\u2019 own actions undermine this type of separate treatment, as their assessments of the property have never attempted to carve out the improvements as separate real estate. And, although the board did not address this precise issue, its finding that the property as a whole belonged to the MBTA and was tax-exempt is consistent with how real estate taxation generally operates \u2014\u2022 by assessing the land and buildings as a unit, and not severing improvements for separate taxation. Here, that unit is exempt from taxation as real property of the MBTA.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">Our examination of the exemption\u2019s statutory purpose further compels the conclusion that the improvements are not subject to taxation. It is clear that the exemption was broadly intended to alleviate the financial burden on the MBTA. See <em>Pickwick, </em>351 Mass, at 624 &amp; n.4. In this case, the taxes assessed on the Headhouse have substantially reduced the rental payments to the MBTA. And, as the board noted, \u201cthe primary concern of the court in <em>Pickwick </em>\u2014 the specter of decreased revenue to an already ailing transportation agency \u2014 remains an issue at present.\u201d The lease provisions granting title to the improvements to EOF were intended to provide an incentive to a private party to participate in a partnership that would make the South Station renovation financially feasible for the financially beleaguered MBTA. The benefits of the improvements and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>property as a whole were intended to inure to the MBTA and, by extension, the public.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Cf. <em>Rohr Aircraft Corp. </em>v. <em>County of San Diego, </em>362 U.S. 628, 634-635 (1960) (despite statute subjecting property of Reconstruction Finance Corporation to taxation, and despite corporation having record title to certain property, property was exempt from taxation because benefits of property inured to United States); <em>Emhart Corp. </em>v. <em>State Tax Commn., </em>363 Mass. 429, 432 (1973) (\u201cmere paper transfer\u201d of property may not alter availability of exemption).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\"><em>Conclusion. </em>For the reasons discussed above, we affirm the board\u2019s ruling that the South Station Headhouse, including the tenant improvements, was exempt from taxation in 2009 and 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">\n<em>Decision of Appellate Tax Board affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b333-15\">As discussed <em>infra, </em>our decision applies to the version of the statute in effect for the tax years at issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b334-7\">Beacon was the initial lessee of the property but assigned its interest to EOF in 1998. Although Beacon was the original petitioner involved in the challenge to the taxes assessed in 2009, the petition was later amended to name EOF as the petitioner for both 2009 and 2010. We will refer primarily to EOF as the interested party for the sake of clarity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b335-7\">In 1970, South Station had one working elevator, and one open staircase. One floor of the station was abandoned, and another floor was closed after a fire.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b336-9\">\u201cTenant\u2019s Work\u201d and \u201cTenant\u2019s Alterations\u201d are defined elsewhere in the lease under similarly broad provisions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b336-11\">The 2010 rental payment had not been made as of the date of the board hearing, and therefore neither the actual payment nor any hypothetical payment adjusted for abatement are in the record.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b337-8\">In contrast, G.

We think it sufficient to note that the language at issue in <em>Pickwick </em>was from the exemption statute that preceded the version at issue here, but the language in both statutes was nearly identical. The only difference in the exemption language interpreted in <em>Piclovick </em>was the absence of the \u201c[notwithstanding any general or special law to the contrary\u201d language which was added when the prior MBTA exemption statute was replaced by G. L. c. 161 A, \u00a7 24.

This argument is unpersuasive, as a party\u2019s understanding of whether property is subject to taxation or an exemption does not control the issue. The outcome is determined by reference to the relevant statutes and case law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b340-10\">The assessors rely solely on the statutory text and do not cite any cases to support this argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b342-7\">Furthermore, BOP\u2019s title to the improvements is only temporary.
