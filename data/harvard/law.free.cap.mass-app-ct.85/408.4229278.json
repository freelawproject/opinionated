L. c. 90, \u00a7 24(l)(a)(l). Before trial, the defendant moved to suppress evidence of a postarrest breathalyzer test. A Boston Municipal Court judge denied the motion, and a single justice of the Supreme Judicial Court allowed the defendant\u2019s application for leave to pursue an interlocutory appeal. See Mass.R.Crim.P. 15(a)(2), as appearing in 422 Mass. 1501 (1996). For the following reasons, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\"><em>Factual background.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>At approximately 2:45 a.m. on April 20, 2012, Officer David Mammone of the Boston police department heard a \u201cloud bang\u201d and turned to see that the defendant had driven his black pickup truck into a police patrol wagon. The officer observed that the defendant had \u201cglassy eyes\u201d and smelled of alcohol. After he failed two of three field sobriety tests, police placed him under arrest. The ensuing voluntary breathalyzer test produced two breath samples measuring .121 and .143 percent blood alcohol content by weight (a difference of .022). The breath testing instrument was the Alcotest 9510; it employed a gas calibration standard. A result of .08 percent, if credited by the factfinder, establishes guilt of OUI. G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24(l)(a)(l), first par.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\"><em>Motion to suppress. </em>Before trial, the defendant moved to suppress evidence of the breathalyzer test. He argued that the test was invalid because .022 percent blood alcohol content units separated his two breath samples. Title 501 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 2.14(4) (2010) provides that, if the administration of a prescribed sequence \u201cdoes not result in breath samples that are within +/- 0.02% blood alcohol content units, a new breath test sequence <em>shall </em>begin\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (emphasis added). The judge denied the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>defendant\u2019s motion in a ruling from the bench. She reasoned that the regulation required rounding the differential of .022 percent to .02 percent because it \u201csimply says 0.02. It doesn\u2019t take it out to the third decimal point.\u201d She explained, \u201cIf [the differential] were [for example] 0.026, then I\u2019d say we have an issue here because we can round it off to 0.03. But you\u2019re 0.022.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>1. <em>Standard of review. </em>The interpretation of a regulation is a question of law which we review de nova. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>B &amp; M Fitzgerald Builders, Inc., </em>71 Mass. App. Ct. 486, 491 (2008), citing <em>GPT-Acton, LLC </em>v. <em>Department of Envtl. Protection, </em>64 Mass. App. Ct. 103, 106 (2005). See also <em>Corsetti </em>v. <em>Stone Co., </em>396 Mass. 1, 12 (1985). \u201cWe interpret a regulation in the same manner as a statute, and according to traditional rules of construction.\u201d <em>Warcewicz </em>v. <em>Department of Envtl. Protection, </em>410 Mass. 548, 550 (1991). \u201cWhen the language of a regulation is \u2018plain it must be given its ordinary meaning, and the language used constitutes the principal source of insight into regulatory purpose.\u2019 \u201d <em>Young </em>v. <em>Patukonis, </em>24 Mass. App. Ct. 907, 908 (1987), quoting from <em>Morin </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub. Welfare, </em>16 Mass. App. Ct. 20, 24 (1983). See <em>Mullally </em>v. <em>Waste Mgmt. of Mass., Inc., </em>452 Mass. 526, 535-536 (2008). \u201cWhere reasonably possible, no portion of the language of a regulation should be treated as surplusage.\u201d <em>Warcewicz </em>v. <em>Department of Envtl. Protection, </em>410 Mass, at 551, quoting from <em>Bottomley </em>v. <em>Division of Administrative Law Appeals, </em>22 Mass. App. Ct. 652, 657 (1986). \u201cLanguage in a regulation, like language in a statute, must be considered in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>light of the other words surrounding it, and its scope and meaning must be determined by reference to context.\u201d <em>Knapp Shoes, Inc. </em>v. <em>Sylvania Shoe Mfg. Corp., </em>418 Mass. 737, 744 (1994) (quotation, citations, and brackets omitted). These canons are advisory, not mandatory; we do not apply them mechanically or dogmatically; and we inspect the results of their application for rationality and practicality. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Buccella, </em>434 Mass. 473, 481 (2001) (refusing to interpret a regulation in a manner that \u201cwould be utterly absurd and . . . clearly not what the [authoring agency] intended\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">2. <em>Evolution of the regulations. </em>The Legislature has charged the Secretary of the Executive Office of Public Safety and Security (Secretary) \u201cwith promulgating rules and regulations \u2018regarding satisfactory methods, techniques and criteria for the conduct of breathalyzer tests.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Steele, </em>455 Mass. 209, 212 (2009) (brackets omitted), quoting from G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24K.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> For a breathalyzer test result to be valid and admissible in evidence, the Commonwealth must demonstrate compliance with those regulations that \u201cgo to the accuracy of the [breath testing] device or manner in which the [breathalyzer] test was performed.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kelley, </em>39 Mass. App. Ct. 448, 453 (1995). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barbeau, </em>411 Mass. 782, 786 (1992); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zeininger, </em>459 Mass. 775, 778-780 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">In 2006, the Secretary promulgated regulations requiring that \u201c[a]ll breath sample and calibration sample results shall be recorded in the two decimal mode. Any third or subsequent decimal place is to be truncated prior to the comparison of the results.\u201d 501 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 2.56(5) (2006). The regulations provided further that, \u201c[u]pan completion of a valid test, the test results shall be made available to the individual under arrest. If the two adequate breath samples, expressed in the two decimal mode, differ within +/- 0.02 blood alcohol content units, the lower of the two adequate breath samples shall be taken as the individual under arrest\u2019s blood alcohol level.\u201d 501 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 2.57 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>In 2010, the Secretary promulgated new regulations \u201cto accommodate advancements/improvements in applicable technology.\u201d See 1155 Mass. Reg. 78 (April 30, 2010); 501 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 2.00 et seq. (2010). Those regulations, which\u2019 govern here, no longer require the recording of all breath samples in the \u201ctwo decimal mode.\u201d Instead, \u201c[t]he results of the analysis of each breath sample and calibration standard shall be reported to at least two decimal places if the test was administered using a liquid calibration standard. The results of the analysis of each breath sample and calibration standard shall be reported <em>in three decimal places, </em>if the calibration standard is gas [as here]\u201d (emphasis supplied). 501 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 2.15(1) (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">Despite this change, the 2010 regulations still provide that, if administration of a prescribed breath test sequence \u201cdoes not result in breath samples that are within +/- 0.02% blood alcohol content units, a new breath test sequence shall begin.\u201d 501 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 2.14(4) (2010). The regulations also retain the requirement that \u201cthe lower of the two breath sample results shall be truncated to two decimal places and reported as the arrestee\u2019s [percentage of blood alcohol content by weight].\u201d 501 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 2.15(2)(b) (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">3. <em>Interpretation of 501 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 2.14(4) (2010). </em>The decisive issue on appeal is the correct interpretation of 501 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 2.14(4) (2010). The defendant argues that the regulation establishes that a breathalyzer test is invalid unless breath samples agree within <em>.020 </em>percent. See 501 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 2.13(4) (2010) (a \u201cbreath test shall be valid and the results admissible in a court of law if it complies with 501 [Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7] 2.14\u201d). The Commonwealth, by contrast, argues that the regulation requires truncation to two decimal places of any differential between breath samples. Truncation means a cutoff of the measurement at two decimal places without regard to the value of any number in the third decimal place. It differs from the colloquial meaning of \u201crounding off\u201d the second decimal place downward or upward by consideration of the third decimal place number.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thus, according to the Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>monwealth, the regulation would permit a differential of up to .029 percent to be truncated to .02 percent.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">Each rationale has some support. On the one hand, .02 percent and .020 percent are mathematically equivalent. Accordingly, the defendant\u2019s contention that any percentage above .020 is not \u201cwithin .02%\u201d has force. In addition, the theory of truncation advanced by the Commonwealth would appear to render meaningless the requirement that \u201cthe results of the analysis of each breath sample and calibration standard shall be reported in three decimal places, if the calibration standard is gas.\u201d 501 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 2.15(1) (2010). See <em>Bottomley </em>v. <em>Division of Administrative Law </em>Appeals, 22 Mass. App. Ct. at 657 (\u201cWhere reasonably possible, no portion of the language of a regulation should be treated as surplusage\u201d). Further, the Commonwealth\u2019s view fails to acknowledge that the 2010 promulgation omits any requirement of truncation to two decimal places for comparison of the two predicate readings. Finally, as noted by the defendant, the record contains the \u201cBreath Test Report Form\u201d reporting his test results. It reads, \u201cTest Results: Test Not Completed: TESTS OUTSIDE TOL[ERANCE].\u201d The training manual for the Alcotest 9510 provides: \u201cIf first two [breath] samples DO NOT agree within +/- 0.02% \u2018TEST OUTSIDE +/- TOE\u2019 will appear on display briefly.\u201d See Jones &amp; Geraghty, Drunk Driving Defense App. B-2, at 795 (2013-2014 ed.).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">On the other hand, the Commonwealth correctly observes, as did the motion judge, that the \u201cplain text\u201d of 501 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 2.14(4) (2010) \u201callows for only two decimal places.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>The Commonwealth points out that, if the Secretary had \u201cintended to [impose] the level of precision that the defendant claims is required under the regulation, [she] would have expanded the permissible range of disparity [between breath samples] to include three decimal places, that is, no greater disparity than .020%.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Also, the Secretary left in place the requirement that, for the purpose of determining an arrestee\u2019s percentage of blood alcohol content, \u201cthe lower of the two breath sample results shall be truncated to two decimal places.\u201d 501 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 2.15(2)(b) (2010). Retention of that two-digit standard suggests that the Secretary has determined that any differential between breath samples may be truncated to two decimal places as a tolerable approximation.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>On balance, we conclude that 501 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 2.14(4) (2010) is ambiguous and that we must reverse the denial of the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress. See <em>Falmouth </em>v. <em>Civil Serv. Commn., </em>447 Mass. 814, 818 (2006), quoting from <em>AT&amp;T </em>v. <em>Automatic Sprinkler Appeals Bd., </em>52 Mass. App. Ct. 11, 14 (2001) (language \u201ccapable of being understood by reasonably well-informed persons in two or more different senses\u201d is ambiguous). Our primary reasoning is literal. The differential in the defendant\u2019s test results, .022, is not \u201cwithin +/- 0.02% blood alcohol content units,\u201d as required by 501 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 2.14(4) (2010). Nothing in the regulations or record pertaining to testing procedures and comparison of results to determine their validity directly supports truncation of the third decimal place of a differential between breath samples obtained from a breath testing instrument employing a gas calibration standard. Standards which \u201ctouch upon criminal acts\u201d demand greater precision than those which \u201cdo not define or relate to criminal conduct.\u201d <em>Caswell </em>v. <em>Licensing Commn. for Brockton, </em>387 Mass. 864, 873 (1983). A regulation \u201cpenal in character\u201d should be unambiguous. See <em>Druzik </em>v. <em>Board of Health of Haverhill, </em>324 Mass. 129, 134 (1949) (regulation \u201cpenal in character . . . should be so clearly expressed that those who may be subject thereto should not have to guess at its meaning\u201d); <em>Aristocratic Restaurant of Mass., Inc. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Bevs. Control Commn. (No. 1), </em>374 Mass. 547, 552-553, appeal dismissed, 439 U.S. 803 (1978); <em>Grocery Mfrs. of Am., Inc. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Health, </em>379 Mass. 70, 83 (1979) (assuming, without deciding, \u201cthat a regulation whose violation is a criminal act is tested by a higher standard of definiteness than a noncriminal regulation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">Definiteness will assist not only the person subject to a regulation, but also the officials charged with its enforcement. Here, adherence to a plainly termed regulation and to the monitor warning against the validity of the first test sequence as beyond the permitted differential would have led the technician to conduct a second test sequence. In short, a duty of clarity rests upon an agency authoring a regulation defining criminal conduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>or defining a standard of proof of that conduct. The present regulations do not satisfy that duty.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">Beyond this literal ground, practical considerations of purpose and fairness support the same outcome. First, the .022 differential between the two measurements, each well above the .08 threshold, does not cause an illogical result, as suggested by the Commonwealth at oral argument: i.e., an election between two breathalyzer results substantially across the actionable .08 threshold. Rather, the differential determines the underlying reliability of the instrumentation and process creating all test results. An excessive differential casts doubt upon the reliability of all the readings. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Steele, </em>455 Mass, at 213 (\u201c[I]mposition of the applicable margin, within .02 percent, see 501 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 2.57 [2006], can be said to safeguard further the reliability of the process. If the results fall outside this margin, the test is altogether invalid\u201d) (interpreting former regulation).</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">Second, we must be concerned with the gravity of a measure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>that, if admitted in evidence, will be a powerful determinant of guilt or innocence. The law provides the prosecution with two modes of proof of the OUI offense. It may offer evidence of impaired operation by the testimony of percipient witnesses. Concomitantly or independently, it may offer into evidence a properly qualified breathalyzer reading of .08 or higher. If the factfinder accepts the reading, it establishes per se the crime. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Colturi, </em>448 Mass. 809, 815-818 (2007); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hubert, </em>71 Mass. App. Ct. 661, 662 n.2 (2008), <em>S.C., </em>453 Mass. 1009 (2009). The reading therefore requires the assurance of accuracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">Third, strict enforcement of the limited differential does not operate unfairly or impractically against the prosecution of OUI charges. Independently of the breathalyzer results, the Commonwealth here and in typical cases can pursue proof of impaired operation by police testimony about the accused\u2019s driving performance, appearance, demeanor, execution of field sobriety tests, and conduct at booking. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Colturi, supra </em>at 811, 817. The requirement of precise standards and reliable breathalyzer readings does not deprive the Commonwealth of a sole source of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">Finally, the Secretary has the ready ability to cure the present ambiguity by a remedial amendment of the regulation to define the permissible differential between two breathalyzer readings reported to the third decimal place. That improvement would demonstrate the competence of the government as the guardian of public safety and as the author of clear standards of criminal liability for violation of the public safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\"><em>Conclusion. </em>We therefore reverse the order denying the motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b441-7\">The judge denied the defendant\u2019s motion in a ruling from the bench.

As to that rule, see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Lanier, </em>520 U.S. 259, 266 (1997) (\u201cthe canon of strict construction of criminal statutes, or rule of lenity, ensures fair warning by so resolving ambiguity in a criminal statute as to apply it only to conduct clearly covered\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zubiel, </em>456 Mass. 27, 33 (2010) (same). Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Paccia, </em>338 Mass. 4, 6 (1958); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>George, </em>406 Mass. 635, 637-640 (1990) (both construing the statute punishing the operation of a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor strictly against the Commonwealth).</p>\n<p id=\"b448-8\">The regulation at issue here does not define criminal conduct, and the defendant does not argue that he lacked fair warning of the elements of operating while under the influence. See, e.g., <em>Matter of a Grand Jury Subpoena, </em>447 Mass. 88, 91 n.2 (2006) (\u201cThe statute before us confers a testimonial privilege; it does not define criminal conduct. The rule of lenity does not apply\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b448-9\">Nonetheless, the government retains the duty of clear definition of standards of criminal responsibility for separate important purposes. Enforcement officers require unambiguous guidance. The public at large should understand the criteria for criminal liability. And the government as creator of those standards should define them with trustworthy competence. \u201cAlthough it is not likely that a criminal will carefully consider the text of the law before he murders or steals, it is reasonable that a fair warning should be given to the world in language that the common world will understand, of what the law intends to do if a certain line is passed. To make the warning fair, so far as possible the line should be clear.\u201d <em>McBoyle </em>v. <em>United States, </em>283 U.S. 25, 27 (1931) (Holmes, J.).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
