See <em>Iannacchino </em>v. <em>Ford Motor Co., </em>451 Mass. 623, 635-636 (2008). In 2003 and 2004, Genovesi, who then was serving as board chair at Network Engines, Inc., realized a cash gain of approximately $3 million from his company\u2019s stock participation plan. At the time, his home was encumbered by a $1.5 million mortgage subject to a prepayment penalty. Accordingly, Genovesi sought a low-risk liquid investment to ensure he would have cash on hand to discharge the mortgage when the prepayment penalty period expired. Genovesi, an unsophisticated investor,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> consulted with his financial advisor, Andrew Nelson, at Lehman Brothers, Inc. (Lehman), to identify an appropriate investment vehicle for his cash holdings. Nelson recommended that Genovesi invest in a collateralized debt obligation known as \u201cParagon CDO.\u201d Nelson told Genovesi that the Paragon CDO investment presented low risk, similar to a United States Treasury or municipal bond. Nelson further represented that the Paragon CDO was comprised of AAA-rated debt and that Genovesi\u2019s risk was limited only to the yield. At Nelson\u2019s recommendation, Genovesi met with two additional Lehman sales agents, Steven Ricciardi and Gannon McCaffery. Ricciardi and McCaffery also advised Genovesi that the Paragon CDO was low risk and was comprised of AAA-rated debt, and that the risk profile was similar to that of a United States Treasury or municipal bond. In reliance on the representations made by Nelson, Ricciardi, and McCaffery, Genovesi invested $1 million in Paragon CDO.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">On November 24, 2004, Nelson provided Genovesi with the unattached signature pages to two documents; the pages were entitled \u201cParagon CDO, Limited, subscription agreement, preference shares\u201d (subscription agreement), and \u201cRisk Factors Acknowledgment\u201d (REA) (collectively, the account documents). Genovesi executed the signature pages \u201cin blank,\u201d and alleges that Nelson never provided him with copies of the account documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>Unbeknownst to Genovesi, he was not qualified to invest in the Paragon CDO under Lehman\u2019s guidelines for individual investors. Without Genovesi\u2019s involvement or knowledge, Nelson prepared an investor profile that contained multiple misrepresentations about Genovesi\u2019s assets, income, and investment experience that, if true, would have qualified him to invest in the CDO.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The defendants also failed to inform Genovesi that the Paragon CDO had two classes of shares: one consisting of AAA-rated debt and another consisting of Baa3rated debt labeled \u201cpreference shares.\u201d The preference shares were rated as a \u201cmoderate credit risk,\u201d possessing \u201cspeculative characteristics.\u201d Nelson invested Genovesi\u2019s entire $1 million in the preference shares.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">In February, 2009, the Paragon CDO announced that the preference shares no longer would pay any interest and would not return any principal. Genovesi lost his entire investment. In July, 2011, Genovesi filed a complaint in Superior Court alleging fraud, fraudulent inducement, negligent misrepresentation, breach of fiduciary duty, and violations of G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 9, and G. L. c. 110A, \u00a7 <em>410(a)-(b) </em>(the Massachusetts Uniform Securities Act, hereinafter MUSA). Shortly after filing his complaint, Genovesi filed an amended complaint and then a second amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">A Superior Court judge allowed the defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss the second amended complaint on the ground that almost seven years had elapsed between Genovesi\u2019s Paragon CDO purchase and the filing of his complaint, and that he had failed to plead any facts upon which to toll the statutes of limitations. The judge, however, provided Genovesi twenty days to cure the pleading defects, and Genovesi timely filed a third amended complaint. The defendants moved to dismiss the third amended complaint. A second Superior Court judge allowed their motions, this time with prejudice, finding as a matter of law that the account documents put Genovesi on notice of his claims in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>2004, and that he failed sufficiently to plead the existence of a fiduciary relationship. Genovesi filed this timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>\u201cWe review the allowance of a motion to dismiss de nova,\u201d <em>Curtis </em>v. <em>Herb Chambers I-95, Inc., </em>458 Mass. 674, 676 (2011), accepting as true \u201cthe factual allegations in the plaintiff[\u2019s] complaint, as well as any favorable inferences reasonably drawn from them,\u201d <em>Ginther </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>427 Mass. 319, 322 (1998). Although detailed factual allegations are not required, a complaint must set forth \u201cmore than labels and conclusions .... Factual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level.\u201d <em>Iannacchino, </em>451 Mass, at 636, quoting from <em>Bell Atl. Corp. </em>v. <em>Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">Genovesi\u2019s claims are subject to either three- or four-year limitations periods;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> assuming that he was injured when his funds first were invested in 2004, his claims expired in 2007 and 2008. Genovesi asserts that this action, commenced in July of 2011, was timely because he neither knew nor should have known that he had suffered an injury as a result of the defendants\u2019 conduct until he lost his investment in February 2009. In the alternative, Genovesi argues that Nelson assumed the role of a fiduciary, violated his duty to Genovesi by withholding \u201cinherently unknowable\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> material information, and so prevented discovery of the injury until 2009. Both arguments rely on the concept of tolling the statute of limitations under the discovery rule. In either case, we consider whether Genovesi\u2019s complaint adequately avers that he neither knew nor should have known that he was harmed by the defendants\u2019 conduct until a date that falls within the applicable three-or four-year period preceding his filing in 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">\u201cIn tort actions and actions for violation of G. L. c. 93A, the cause of action accrues at the time the plaintiff is injured.\u201d See <em>Stark </em>v. <em>Advanced Magnetics, Inc., </em>50 Mass. App. Ct. 226, 232 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>(2000) . A claim under MUSA accrues when a reasonable investor would have noticed that something was \u201camiss.\u201d <em>Marram </em>v. <em>Kobrick Offshore Fund, Ltd., </em>442 Mass. 43, 54 n.20 (2004). The defendants assert that Genovesi had actual notice of his claims in 2004 or, at the very least, had constructive notice when he signed the signature pages of the account documents. According to the defendants, the signature pages contained conspicuous disclosures that defeat any legally cognizable contention that the misrepresented facts were inherently unknowable. We disagree. There is no principle of law under which a lay investor such as Genovesi is deemed to understand the reference to \u201cpreference shares\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> at the top of the signature page of the subscription agreement as a warning that his investment was not as represented.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">The defendants also point to the reference to \u201crisk\u201d at the top of the signature page of the RFA. They argue, correctly, that the acknowledgment at the top of the RFA signature page should have given Genovesi caution in signing in blank without requesting to review the entire document. However, the reasonableness of his actions in the circumstances is a question of fact that is not appropriately resolved on a motion to dismiss. See <em>id. </em>at 59-60 (reasonableness of plaintiff\u2019s reliance may be considered question of law, \u201cbut generally only after some record has been established on a motion for summary judgment or after a trial\u201d). See also <em>Patsos </em>v. <em>First Albany Corp., </em>433 Mass. 323, 329 (2001) (\u201cfactual disputes concerning when a plaintiff knew or should have known of his cause[s] of action are to be resolved by the jury\u201d), quoting from <em>Riley </em>v. <em>Presnell, </em>409 Mass. 239, 247 (1991). Thus, we reject the defendants\u2019 argument that the signature pages provide a legal basis to dismiss Genovesi\u2019s complaint on the rationale that their wording requires a ruling that he had actual knowledge of his claims in 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">Alternatively, the defendants argue that Genovesi should be charged with knowledge of the full contents of the account documents as a matter of law, regardless of his averment that he never received copies, because one who signs his name to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>legal document is presumed to have knowledge of its contents. See, e.g., <em>Kuwaiti Danish Computer Co. </em>v. <em>Digital Equip. Corp., </em>438 Mass. 459, 465 (2003); <em>Mayflower Seafoods, Inc. </em>v. <em>Integrity Credit Corp., </em>25 Mass. App. Ct. 453, 459 (1988); <em>Hull </em>v. <em>Attleboro Sav. Bank, </em>33 Mass. App. Ct. 18, 24 (1992). We consider the presumption misapplied here. Genovesi has alleged that he never had the opportunity to review the account documents because Nelson withheld them from him. It was critical to the holdings of the above-cited cases that those plaintiffs had the opportunity to review the legal documents they signed, but chose not to do so. See <em>Kuwaiti Danish Computer Co., supra </em>(plaintiff \u201creviewed the quotation and had the opportunity to read the qualifying language, but instead ignored it\u201d); <em>Mayflower Seafoods, Inc., supra </em>at 458-459 (plaintiff\u2019s assertion that he did not understand terms of lease was unavailing where lease agreement was two-page document printed double-sided and he was given opportunity to review it); <em>Hull, supra </em>at 24 n.8 (plaintiff, a lawyer, claimed he did not remember preparing or signing letter in question, but raised \u201cno claim that his signature was procured by fraud or undue influence\u201d). Moreover, those cases involved legal documents that were negotiated by adverse parties at arm\u2019s length, did not involve allegations of a fiduciary relationship, and were not decided on a motion to dismiss. For all of these reasons, we conclude that the judge erred in finding as a matter of law that Genovesi had actual or constructive knowledge of his claims in 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">For his part, Genovesi asserts that he did not suffer any harm until the Paragon CDO collapsed in 2009, and that he could not have filed suit any earlier because his causes of action were not complete until he lost his investment. We evaluate this argument solely with respect to his claims alleging negligence and violation of c. 93A. The other causes of action accrued \u2014 regardless of the portfolio\u2019s performance \u2014 when Genovesi\u2019s funds were invested in the preference shares;<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> conversely, we acknowledge that causes of action based on negligence and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>c. 93A require a showing of financial detriment to satisfy the element of harm. See <em>Hershenow </em>v. <em>Enterprise Rent-A-Car Co. of Boston, </em>445 Mass. 790, 797 (2006) (c. 93A claim requires proof of causal loss); <em>Nota Constr. Corp. </em>v. <em>Keyes Assocs., Inc., </em>45 Mass. App. Ct. 15, 20 &amp; n.l (1998) (negligent misrepresentation claim requires proof of \u201cpecuniary loss\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">However, we agree with the defendants that the principle of ratification applies to prevent tolling of all of Genovesi\u2019s causes of action once he was, or should have been, aware of the alleged fraud or misrepresentations. <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> It long has been recognized that, once possessed of actual or constructive knowledge, a plaintiff in Genovesi\u2019s position cannot simply wait for an unfavorable return before asserting his rights. See <em>Krinsky </em>v. <em>Whitney, </em>315 Mass. 661, 667 (1944) (plaintiff who intends to rescind agreement on account of fraud \u201ccould not stand by. . . until it appeared whether the account would prove profitable or otherwise\u201d); <em>Mechanics Natl. Bank of Worcester </em>v. <em>Killeen, </em>377 Mass. 100, 114-115 (1979) (broker not liable for improper sale of stock beyond when customer could have rectified error). See also <em>Schofield </em>v. <em>First Commodity Corp. of Boston, </em>793 F.2d 28, 36 (1st Cir. 1986). Accepting his allegations as trac for purposes of the motion to dismiss, Genovesi first knew that he had been misled in 2009 when the Paragon CDO announced that it would not pay interest or return any principal for the preference shares. Whether Genovesi received periodic account statements or other materials that did, or should have, put him on notice earlier than 2009 is a matter that may be resolved through discovery or at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">Finally, we turn to Genovesi\u2019s assertion that the statute of limitations was tolled on the additional basis of Nelson\u2019s breach <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>of his fiduciary duty. Genovesi has alleged that he was an unsophisticated investor, that Nelson had specialized knowledge inherent in the exercise of his profession, that Nelson encouraged Genovesi to rely on his expertise, that Genovesi did so rely, and that it was Nelson\u2019s practice in managing Genovesi\u2019s investments to ask him to sign documents in blank. Genovesi has made a prima facie claim for breach of fiduciary duty. See <em>Patsos </em>v. <em>First Albany Corp., </em>433 Mass, at 336-337. He also adequately has alleged that Nelson\u2019s material omissions are \u201cequivalent to fraudulent concealment\u201d for purposes of G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 12. <em>Id. </em>at 329, citing <em>Demoulas </em>v. <em>Demoulas Super Mkts., Inc., </em>424 Mass. 501, 519 (1997). It was error to conclude as a matter of law that the third amended complaint failed to plead the breach of a fiduciary relationship by Nelson.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\"><em>Conclusion. </em>On this record the allowance of the motions to dismiss the third amended complaint was error. The pleadings allege with sufficient detail that Genovesi was misled by Nelson, assisted by Ricciardi and McCaffery, into believing he had placed his funds in a liquid low-risk investment, and that the truth was inherently unknowable, thus setting forth a legal basis to toll the statute of limitations. The extent to which Genovesi had access to contrary information, rendering his reliance and continued acquiescence unreasonable (thus causing the statutes of limitations to run their course), is neither evident factually nor compelled legally by his signature on the signature pages the defendants provided. With the exception of the breach of fiduciary duty claims against Ricciardi and McCaffery which properly were dismissed, we reverse the judgment allowing the motions to dismiss Genovesi\u2019s third amended complaint, and remand the matter to the Superior Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b76-6\">We find no support in the sparse record for the judge\u2019s finding to the-contrary. The record demonstrates only that Genovesi\u2019s financial wherewithal resulted from his ownership and participation in a successful technology-based company rather than from investment or financial dealings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b77-7\">In particular, the investor profile stated that Genovesi had an aggregate net worth of $15 million (approximately five times greater than his actual net worth), a liquid net worth of $10 million (Genovesi\u2019s actual liquid net worth was approximately $2 million), and an annual salary of $1 million (in 2004, his actual annual salary was $200,000). The profile also contained misrepresentations as to Genovesi\u2019s investment experience and sophistication.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b78-8\">Genovesi\u2019s statutory claims are subject to four-year limitations periods, see G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 5A, and G. L. c. 110A, \u00a7 410(e), while his common-law claims are subject to three-year limitations periods, see G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 2A.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b78-9\">We use the phrases \u201cshould not have known\u201d and \u201cinherently unknowable\u201d interchangeably in our consideration. See <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Ely, </em>423 Mass. 467, 473 n.7 (1996) (discovery rule\u2019s \u201cinherently unknowable\u201d standard is used interchangeably with \u201cknew or should have known\u201d standard).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b79-8\">To the extent that the signature pages themselves can be alleged to contain representations about the nature of the investment vehicles, the term \u201cpreference\u201d commonly connotes desirability and not a speculative level of risk.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b80-6\">We are unpersuaded by Genovesi\u2019s argument that he was precluded from asserting his rights before suffering actual financial loss because neither Lehman nor the defendants were the issuers of the securities and therefore could not be ordered to unwind the investment. Assuming that the defendants had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>been found liable, they could have been required to place Genovesi in the correct investment or in a financial position equivalent to that he would have occupied had their representations been truthful. See generally <em>Mechanics Natl. Bank of Worcester </em>v. <em>Killeen, </em>377 Mass. 100, 113 (1979) (damages for bank\u2019s unauthorized sale of stock measured by value at time of wrongful conduct). Cf. <em>Krinsky </em>v. <em>Whitney, </em>315 Mass. 661, 666 (1944).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b81-13\"> \u201cRatification is a doctrine of agency law in which a principal is deemed to adopt the previously unauthorized actions of his or her agent by failing to object after finding out about them.\u201d <em>Schofield </em>v. <em>First Commodity Corp. of Boston, </em>793 F.2d 28, 36 (1st Cir. 1986), citing <em>Jaksich </em>v. <em>Thomas McKinnon Sec., Inc., </em>582 F.

The first judge determined that Genovesi had failed to allege sufficient facts to support a fiduciary relationship only with respect to Ricciardi and McCaffery. Genovesi does not challenge the dismissal of his claims of breach of fiduciary duty as to those two defendants.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b82-8\">We deny the request for appellate fees by Ricciardi and McCaffery.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
