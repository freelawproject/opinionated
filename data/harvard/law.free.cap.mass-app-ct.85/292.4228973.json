L. c. 93A. We hold that, in the discretion of the trial judge, such fees may be awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">The plaintiffs (sometimes referred to collectively as Omniglow) brought the present action against Cyalume Technologies, Inc. (Cyalume), and Emil Jachmann, its chief executive officer (collectively, defendants), seeking to remedy the defendants\u2019 efforts to undermine the plaintiffs\u2019 business. After a seventeen-day, jury-waived trial, the judge found the defendants liable for numerous breaches of contract, conversion, and violations of G. L. c. 93A. Several posttrial proceedings ensued, concluding in a final judgment entered on August 1, 2011, largely in favor of the plaintiffs. Following the disposition of the postjudgment motions, an amended final judgment was entered on July 12, 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">On appeal, the defendants raise many issues. While involved and complicated, ultimately they are of a garden variety, albeit weed-infested, and best resolved via an unpublished memorandum and order pursuant to our rule 1:28 that is also being issued today. <em>Holland </em>v. <em>Jachmann (No. 2), post </em>1120 (2014). As such, we concern ourselves here only with the c. 93A issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-8\"><em>Background. </em>This business dispute arose out of a complicated transaction through which the Omniglow Corporation, a manufacturer of light sticks and other luminescent products, was effectively split into two companies.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-9\">In late 2005, the company now known as Cyalume purchased the profitable segments of the Omniglow Corporation consisting principally of sales in the government, military, and safety (GMS) markets. As a condition of the closing of the stock purchase agreement, Omniglow Corporation was required to divest itself of all the assets and liabilities related to the unprofitable \u201crest of glow\u201d (ROG) segments.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-10\">On January 23, 2006, the day the sale closed, the plaintiffs purchased, pursuant to the terms of the ROG purchase agreement, the ROG segments and the right to the Omniglow name. The plaintiffs, the judge found, planned to turn the ROG segments around by manufacturing all products at a lower cost at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>their facility in Mexico as soon as possible. On the same day, Omniglow and Cyalume also entered into a series of contracts defining their rights and obligations to each other going forward, including as herein relevant, a lease agreement, a manufacturing agreement, an information technology (IT) sharing agreement, and a noncompetition agreement prohibiting Cyalume from competing in the ROG business and from soliciting or taking away ROG customers and business.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">Although a mutually supportive working relationship was anticipated, the relationship between Omniglow and Cyalume quickly soured. Cyalume missed a deadline for submitting an audited income statement that was required for the distribution of escrow funds sorely needed by Omniglow. It also withheld two pieces of equipment \u2022\u2014 a six-inch mold and a \u201cmini-wrapper\u201d used to wrap Speculite and Vizilite light sticks in foil \u2014 essential for Omniglow\u2019s business. Cyalume was obligated to provide these pieces of equipment pursuant to the ROG purchase agreement, yet refused to do so. Without the mold and the mini-wrapper, Omniglow was compelled to purchase products from Cyalume that Omniglow could have otherwise manufactured itself for less money. Cyalume, the judge found, also blocked Omniglow from resolving title disputes through the special procedure called for in the ROG purchase agreement.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">This pattern continued with the extrusion system integral to the manufacture of necklaces, bracelets, and other smaller tubular devices, \u201cwhich are a major part of the Omniglow, LLC product line.\u201d In light of the unambiguous designations in the schedules to the ROG purchase agreement, the judge found that Cyalume\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>ownership claims to Omniglow\u2019s equipment were not made in good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">Cyalume also converted other assets dedicated for use in the ROG business that belonged to Omniglow. First, Cyalume withheld 1.63 million adhesive strips from Omniglow used exclusively by Omniglow to manufacture its Speculite product. Cyalume not only denied the request of Watson Pharmaceuticals (Watson), one of Omniglow\u2019s major customers, to replace 45,000 defective strips, but also required Watson to purchase more than five times the amount needed at three times the cost.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On two occasions, because Cyalume had not released the adhesive strips that rightfully belonged to Omniglow, Omniglow was forced to buy those strips back from Cyalume at an inflated price.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">The judge found other breaches by Cyalume. Based on credibility determinations, the judge found that Michael Bielonko, Cyalume\u2019s chief financial officer, instructed Michelle Ruby, Cyalume\u2019s IT chief, to prevent Omniglow employees from accessing important documents and information stored in the computer system. The judge also found that Bielonko and Jachmann personally instructed Ruby to delay resolution of Omniglow\u2019s computer glitches, needlessly prolonging the problems. The judge found that these wilful and intentional breaches of the IT sharing agreement disrupted and jeopardized the business of Omniglow and that this \u201cdisconcerting\u201d conduct of Cyalume\u2019s top executives was intended to further the scheme to debilitate Omniglow.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">Cyalume intercepted and filled a purchase order intended for Omniglow and sold novelty light sticks that it was forbidden to sell under the noncompetition agreement to two customers, Trevco and Coghlan\u2019s. As the judge found, the light sticks sold to Coghlan\u2019s \u201cwere unmistakably novelty items due to their packaging.\u201d While there may have been some confusion about Cyalume\u2019s right to sell to Trevco, the judge concluded that the sales to Coghlan\u2019s were, in contrast, wilful and knowing violations of c. 93A.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-8\">As time passed, Cyalume\u2019s conduct toward Omniglow became <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>even more threatening and damaging. After wrongfully evicting Omniglow from a shared West Springfield facility, Cyalume refused to turn over two telephone numbers dedicated for use by ROG customers that rightfully belonged to Omniglow. These telephone numbers were of significant financial value to Omniglow, as customers often used them to reorder products. Cyalume subsequently failed to refer some novelty customers to Omniglow.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Moreover, using one of Omniglow\u2019s telephone numbers, Cyalume advertised itself as a novelty manufacturer in the Yellow Pages telephone directory, actively soliciting ROG business in \u201cflagrant\u201d breach of both the ROG purchase and noncompetition agreements. Because there could not have been any confusion about Omniglow\u2019s right to these telephone numbers, the judge concluded that their withholding was done in bad faith and was intended to derail the business of Omniglow.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">Jachmann threatened one of the principals of ONTI, the only legitimate supplier of chemicals to Omniglow (other than Cyalume), with a baseless lawsuit unless he stopped selling to Omniglow. The intent of the threat, the judge found, was to coerce Omniglow into buying chemicals from Cyalume on terms that were not favorable to Omniglow.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">On the c. 93A count, the judge found that the actions undertaken by Cyalume and Jachmann were part of an effort to undermine Omniglow\u2019s business interests, and that this pattern of conduct rose to the level of a c. 93A violation. The defendants appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\"><em>G. L. c. 93A. </em>While the defendants contest c. 93A liability, we need not tarry long on the many reasons a finding of a c. 93A violation was appropriate. Much more sinister conduct than simple breaches of contract was proved here. Summing up the defendants\u2019 culpability, the judge found and ruled that \u201c[t]he evidence presented at trial in this case disclose[d] a disturbing pattern of egregious conduct by the defendants, not only in disregarding the contractual rights of Omniglow, LLC under the ROG Purchase Agreement and other contracts, but in engaging in conduct unmistakably aimed at undermining Omniglow, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>LLC.\u201d The objectionable conduct found unfair included \u201cflagrant\u201d contractual breaches where no confusion about rights and duties existed as well as bad faith breaches intended to secure advantages for Cyalume. See <em>Vita </em>v. <em>Berman, DeValerio &amp; Pease, LLP, </em>81 Mass. App. Ct. 748, 755-756 (2012). The judge\u2019s conclusion that eight separate acts rose to the level of violations of G. L. c. 93A was amply supported by the evidence. See <em>Casavant </em>v. <em>Norwegian Cruise Line Ltd., </em>460 Mass. 500, 503 (2011).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\"><em>Attorney\u2019s fees under c. 93A. </em>The defendants argue that the judge improperly awarded attorney\u2019s fees for legal work performed by George Stanbury, in-house counsel to Omniglow.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The question whether in-house counsel fees are \u201cincurred\u201d for the purposes of an award of attorney\u2019s fees under G. L. c. 93A is, surprisingly, a novel one.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">\u201cGeneral Laws c. 93A, \u00a7 11, sixth par., authorizes the award of attorney\u2019s fees \u2018incurred in connection with said action\u2019 (i.e., the G. L. c. 93A action), but not for other actions.\u201d <em>Drywall Sys., Inc. </em>v. <em>ZVI Constr. Co., </em>435 Mass. 664, 673 (2002). \u201cThe entire tenor of G. L. c. 93A is to award attorney\u2019s fees and costs to a party who succeeds in demonstrating that a defendant has violated G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 2(a).\u201d <em>Barron </em>v. <em>Fidelity Magellan Fund, </em>57 Mass. App. Ct. 507, 517 (2003), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fall River Motor Sales, Inc., </em>409 Mass. 302, 316 (1991). \u201cSuch a view is consistent with \u2018the scheme of the statute and the Legislature\u2019s manifest purpose of deterring misconduct.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">Here, the defendants urge that legal fees are not recoverable under c. 93A for in-house counsel\u2019s services. They argue that because Stanbury, a salaried employee, failed to bill Omniglow for his services, legal expenses were not \u201cincurred\u201d for the purposes of c. 93A and that, furthermore, the value of his work was purely speculative and undocumented.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>Conversely, the plaintiffs argue that \u201cthe purpose of awarding [attorney\u2019s] fees is essentially punitive and there is no reason to relieve defendants from the consequences of their wrongful acts merely because Stanbury was in-house counsel and not paid on an hourly basis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">The judge rejected the defendants\u2019 arguments, grounding his decision primarily on principles of fairness, the public policy served by fee awards, and case law upholding statutorily mandated fee awards even in the absence of billing. See <em>Lincoln St. Realty Co. </em>v. <em>Green, </em>374 Mass. 630, 632 (1978) (\u201cStatutory authorization to award attorney\u2019s fees to the prevailing party in certain types of actions primarily serves the interrelated purposes of encouraging private enforcement of particular laws chosen by the Legislature, deterring illegal conduct in connection with these laws, and punishing those who violate these laws\u201d); <em>Linthicum </em>v. <em>Archambault, </em>379 Mass. 381, 388 (1979) (\u201cAs to attorney\u2019s fees, the law is quite clear that when attorney\u2019s fees are statutorily authorized legal services organizations are entitled to receive such awards\u201d [quotation omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">We agree with the judge\u2019s reasoning. On a practical level, as the judge observed, every hour spent on the Cyalume litigation was an hour when Stanbury\u2019s efforts were directed away from other legal matters facing Omniglow. Therefore, having in-house counsel engaged in the present suit had a concrete financial impact on Omniglow, which we conclude \u201cincurred\u201d a cost. In addition, the judge\u2019s description of Stanbury as having \u201cactively participated at all stages of this matter as lead counsel\u201d further supports his award of fees. Compare <em>Arthur D. Little Intl., Inc. </em>v. <em>Dooyang Corp., </em>995 F. Supp. 217, 225 (D. Mass. 1998) (no award of attorney\u2019s fees for in-house counsel who \u201cwas merely the client,\u201d and who had little or no participation in the trial proceedings).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">We also consider the policy underlying c. 93A. To deny attorney\u2019s fees to Omniglow in this case simply because it chose to utilize its own in-house counsel would undercut the deterrent purposes of c. 93A and would implicitly reward the defendants for their questionable behavior. For these reasons, we conclude that an award of attorney\u2019s fees under c. 93A is permissible, in the discretion of the trial judge, for the services of in-house <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>counsel. This interpretation furthers the broad remedial purpose of c. 93A. See <em>Kraft Power Corp. </em>v. <em>Merrill, </em>464 Mass. 145, 164-165 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">Turning to the calculation of Stanbury\u2019s fees,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> we find no abuse of the judge\u2019s broad discretion in the amount of the award, in spite of our reservations with the documentation provided in support of the fee request. See <em>T. Butera Auburn, LLC </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>83 Mass. App. Ct. 496, 503-504 (2013). Trial judges are \u201cin the best position to determine how much time was reasonably spent on a case, and the fair value of the attorney\u2019s services.\u201d <em>Fontaine </em>v. <em>Ebtec Corp., </em>415 Mass. 309, 324 (1993).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">Here, the judge based the award on Stanbury\u2019s \u201cdemonstrated competence and experience, the length of the trial, the difficulty of the legal and factual issues, the enormous amount of time necessarily expended by Stanbury in trial preparation, and the plaintiffs\u2019 degree of success.\u201d As the judge noted, Stanbury and Aronson achieved great success in the case, obtaining substantial damage awards on most of the c. 93A claims. The judge\u2019s decision demonstrates that he applied the appropriate factors in arriving at what he considered a reasonable fee award.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> See <em>Linthicum, </em>379 Mass, at 388-389 (proper considerations include \u201cthe nature of the case and the issues presented, the time and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>labor required, the amount of damages involved, the result obtained, the experience, reputation, and ability of the attorney, the usual price charged for similar services by other attorneys in the same area, and the amount of awards in similar cases\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">Stanbury\u2019s failure to provide contemporaneous timesheets, while concerning, was not an insurmountable impediment to the fee award. See <em>Handy </em>v. <em>Penal Insts. Commr. of Boston, </em>412 Mass. 759, 767 (1992). In his certified fee application, Stanbury produced a month-by-month list of all time spent on the case with a brief but specific description of the services he provided each month. The judge found that more detailed records were unnecessary to show that the amount of time claimed was \u201ceminently reasonable.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Stanbury knew in advance of the case that if the plaintiffs prevailed, a statutory fee award would be sought. While better practice would have been to keep contemporaneous time records, we conclude that the documentation Stanbury provided, combined with the judge\u2019s firsthand knowledge of the case and Stanbury\u2019s services, provided a non-speculative basis for calculating fees.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> See <em>Heller </em>v. <em>Silver-branch Constr. Corp., 316 </em>Mass. 621, 631 (1978) (plaintiffs properly awarded attorney\u2019s fees under c. 93A \u201cnotwithstanding the absence of evidence concerning time spent and the attorney\u2019s usual charge\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">We conclude that, while the documentation provided to the judge was less than ideal, it was sufficient in this case to justify the award of fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">\n<em>Amended final judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b326-7\">On this matter, the judge found that \u201c[b]ecause separating the ROG and GMS segments was complex and it was understood that some inventory and equipment could not easily be classified exclusively as an asset of either set of segments, the ROG Purchase Agreement required the parties to negotiate in good faith any additions or corrections to the ROG equipment schedules to make them accurate and complete.\u201d In the event of an impasse, the parties were required to submit any disagreements about the schedules arising before August 31, 2006, to John Friedson, the Omniglow Corporation executive who made the original allocation decisions. Stanley Holland, an Omniglow principal, timely invoked the remedy provision of the ROG purchase agreement seeking a quick resolution to the equipment ownership disputes with Cyalume. Friedson, the judge found, was willing to serve as the arbiter until he received an electronic mail message from Cyalume\u2019s attorney threatening him with a lawsuit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b327-9\">Omniglow reimbursed Watson for the amount charged by Cyalume.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b328-8\">The judge found that although Omniglow lost customers and orders as a result of Cyalume\u2019s conduct, Omniglow was unable to quantify the value of this loss.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b329-8\">The judge did not rule against the defendants on all issues, e.g., a breach of the lease by denying access to the leased premises, and a related c. 93A claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b329-9\">Fees were also awarded for services rendered by Robert Aronson, a commercial litigator based in Springfield, who assisted Stanbury in the case. The defendants have not challenged the separate award of $71,596.84 for Aron-son\u2019s fees.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b331-7\">Stanbury was retained by Omniglow in and around October, 2006. At the time, he was in private practice in Santa Monica, California. In July, 2007, Stanbury became general counsel for Omniglow.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b331-8\">To calculate appropriate in-house counsel fees, other jurisdictions have adopted either the market rate approach (computing fees based on what would reasonably be charged by outside counsel), or the cost-plus analysis (proportionate share of the attorney\u2019s salary, including cost of overhead, allocable to the matter in question). See <em>Milgard Tempering, Inc. </em>v. <em>Selas Corp. of America, </em>761 F.2d 553, 558 (9th Cir. 1985) (adopting \u201cmodem trend\u201d of market rate calculation); <em>Softsolutions, Inc. </em>v. <em>Brigham Young Univ., 1 </em>P.3d 1095, 1107 (Utah 2000) (adopting cost-plus analysis). We hold that a judge may utilize either method in his or her discretion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b331-9\">As in-house counsel for Omniglow, Stanbury received an annual salary of $200,000. Prior to that position, Stanbury charged $350 per hour in private practice in the Santa Monica area. The judge found that $350 was a reasonable hourly rate for a highly experienced attorney working on similarly complex litigation in the Springfield area. That Aronson, another highly experienced attorney, charged a lower rate, $225 per hour, is of no consequence. To the extent the defendants challenge Stanbury\u2019s rate as incongruous, we see no abuse of discretion in light of the judge\u2019s description of Stanbury\u2019s role as lead counsel and the evidence concerning the range of rates in the Springfield area.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b332-8\">As the judge noted, the factually and legally complex case involved \u201cnumerous contracts, technology and sales, international production, voluminous business records, and a 17 day trial with 72 exhibits.\u201d Stanbury, moreover, took or defended eighteen depositions and did not charge for travel time.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b332-9\">Ultimately, the judge awarded $152,906.25 for legal work performed by Stanbury, which appears reasonable given the damages awarded of over $2 million. Compare <em>Arthur D. Little Intl., Inc. </em>v. <em>Dooyang Corp., </em>995 F. Supp. at 225 (awarding $915,707 in attorney\u2019s fees on damages of $920,000). In arriving at the figure, the judge credited Stanbury\u2019s documentation, yet reduced the amount of his fees by twenty-five percent to reflect (i) the approximate amount of time spent on non-c. 93A segments of the case, and (ii) the time spent defending the c. 93A counterclaim.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
