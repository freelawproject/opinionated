The Pattersons brought suit after Linda was injured as a result of her falling inside the church. On appeal, the Pattersons claim the Superior Court judge erred in determining that the recreational use statute, G. L. c. 21, \u00a7 17C, barred liability on Linda\u2019s negligence claims, and that Linda\u2019s claims under the consumer protection act, G. L. c. 93A, were not viable.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-10\"><em>Background. </em>1. <em>The accident. </em>The material facts are not in dispute. In October, 2006, the Pattersons visited Old North Church, a historic landmark located in Boston\u2019s North End. The Pattersons, who were in their sixties at the time, traveled to Boston as part of a sightseeing tour organized by a senior center near their home in Georgia. The couple paid the senior center $1,738 to participate in the trip, which also included stops at tourist destinations in Virginia, Connecticut, and New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-11\">Neither the Pattersons nor anyone in their sightseeing group were charged a fee to enter or tour the church. When the group was inside the sanctuary, a docent ushered the group to sit in the church\u2019s pew boxes. At the entryway to each raised pew box was a hinged door and a single-step riser painted a shade of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>red similar to the red carpet on the floor. The Pattersons were not warned to use caution or watch their step. As Linda attempted to enter a pew box, she tripped on the riser and fell on the pew bench. She sustained serious injuries that required surgery and rehabilitation, and incurred significant medical expenses that were not covered by her health insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">2. <em>The church. </em>The Old North Foundation of Boston, Inc. (foundation), is a nonprofit organization responsible for organizing tours and historical programs at the church. Over 500,000 tourists visit annually. Docents employed by the foundation answer questions and give free presentations to the public. The terms of the foundation\u2019s operations at the church are detailed in a memorandum of understanding (MOU) signed by the foundation, Christ Church in the City of Boston (Christ Church),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and the Episcopal Diocese of Massachusetts. In 2006, the MOU required the foundation, in addition to other responsibilities, to pay Christ Church $93,780 for the right to operate. The foundation raises revenue from its gift shop, from fees for specialized tours to exclusive areas of the church, and from other development efforts.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\"><em>Standard of review. </em>\u201cIn considering a motion for summary judgment, we view the evidence and draw all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.\u201d <em>Premier Capital, LLC </em>v. <em>KMZ, Inc., </em>464 Mass. 467, 474-475 (2013). Our review is de nova, and we \u201cmust determine whether all material facts and questions of law are resolved.\u201d <em>Suffolk Constr. Co. </em>v. <em>Illinois Union Ins. Co., </em>80 Mass. App. Ct. 90, 93 (2011). Negligence cases are not frequently resolved by summary judgment, but \u201ca judge may decide the issue as matter of law when no rational view of the evidence permits a finding of negligence,\u201d <em>Roderick </em>v. <em>Brandy Hill Co., </em>36 Mass. App. Ct. 948, 949 (1994); or as here, where the defendant offers a statutory exemption from liability as an affirmative defense. See <em>Seich </em>v. <em>Canton, </em>426 Mass. 84 (1997); <em>Ali </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>441 Mass. 233 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\"><em>Discussion. </em>1. <em>Negligence claims under the recreational use statute. </em>The Pattersons contend that Linda\u2019s accident occurred because, in the poorly lit church, she was unable to discern the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>red riser from the red carpet. They allege that by maintaining the property in this defective condition, the defendants breached a duty of reasonable care owed to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">The recreational use statute, G. L. c. 21, \u00a7 17C (the statute),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> grants an exemption from liability for ordinary negligence where a defendant has an interest in land, the plaintiff was injured when engaged in a recreational activity on that land, and the defendant did not \u201cimpos[e] a charge or fee\u201d for the injured plaintiff\u2019s use of the land. G. L. c. 21, \u00a7 17C. See <em>Marcus </em>v. Newton, 462 Mass. 148, 153-155 (2012). \u201c[F]or purposes of landowner liability, while recreational users fall into the category of \u2018lawful visitors\u2019 under the common law, by statute they comprise a discrete subgroup of lawful visitors owed only the standard of care applicable to trespassers: that is, landowners must refrain from wilful, wanton, or reckless conduct as to their safety.\u201d <em>Ali </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>441 Mass, at 237.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">The parameters of this appeal are as follows. The Pattersons do not dispute the judge\u2019s determination that the defendants have an interest in the church sufficient to warrant protection under the statute.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Also, the fact that the church anticipates and accommodates a high volume of tourism activity does not disqualify the Pattersons\u2019 visit from being considered a \u201crecre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>ational use.\u201d See <em>Ali </em>v. <em>Boston, supra </em>at 238. The act of visiting a tourist destination while on vacation passes the test of \u201cwhether the plaintiff is . . . engaged in an objectively recreational activity.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Finally, on appeal the Pattersons have abandoned their claim that the defendants\u2019 actions rose to the level of wilful, wanton, or reckless conduct for purposes of the statute. See <em>Dunn </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>75 Mass. App. Ct. 556, 562 (2009). As a result, we are tasked with determining whether the defendants are excluded from the protections of the statute based on whether they \u201cimpose[d] a charge or fee\u201d under the statute. See G. L. c. 21, \u00a7 17C.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">Despite the fact that the Pattersons entered and toured the church free of charge, they claim that the defendants imposed a \u201ccharge or fee\u201d because the foundation generates revenue and pays Christ Church an annual fee. In support of this assertion, the Pattersons rely on <em>Marcus </em>v. <em>Newton, </em>462 Mass, at 155-156, and argue that a defendant who reaps an economic benefit from property utilized by the public free of charge is barred from relief under the recreational use statute. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">In <em>Marcus, </em>the Supreme Judicial Court held that when determining a defendant\u2019s exemption from negligence liability under the recreational use statute, \u201cthe issue is whether the landowner charges a fee for the particular use to which the plaintiff puts the land.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 154-155. The injured plaintiff in <em>Marcus </em>paid eighty dollars to join a private softball league, and the league then paid the city of Newton $1,200 for a permit for use of a playing field. <em>Id. </em>at 149. The court concluded that the city was not, as a matter of law, shielded from liability because under these \u201ccircumstances, Marcus was not participating in a recreational use of the city\u2019s property free of charge.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 155. Moreover, the court distinguished <em>Seich </em>v. <em>Canton, </em>426 Mass. 84 (1997), and <em>Whooley </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>57 Mass. App. Ct. 909 (2003), by noting that the injured plaintiffs in those cases did not pay a fee for their recreational use of the defendants\u2019 property, i.e., watching a child participate in youth athletics. <em>Marcus </em>v. <em>Newton, supra </em>at 155. The fact that the children in <em>Seich </em>and <em>Whooley </em>had paid to participate in sports \u201chad no bearing on each injured plaintiff\u2019s own recreational use of the property in question, for which there was no charge.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">Unlike the injured plaintiff in <em>Marcus, </em>who paid an indirect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>fee for his use of the defendant\u2019s land, here, it is undisputed that the Pattersons paid neither a direct nor an indirect fee to enter or tour the church. There is no claim that any part of the $1,738 they paid the Georgia senior center facilitated their access to the church. The fact that the foundation operates a gift shop and charges for behind-the-scenes, specialized tours of the church does not equate to a \u201ccharge or fee\u201d imposed on the Pattersons. See <em>Marcus </em>v. <em>Newton, supra </em>at 154-155.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">In similar vein, the annual fee the foundation paid Christ Church is not akin to the softball league permitting fee in <em>Marcus </em>and does not constitute a \u201ccharge or fee\u201d under the statute. Unlike the plaintiff in <em>Marcus, </em>the Pattersons made no contribution, direct or indirect, to the $93,780 payment the foundation made to Christ Church in 2006. See <em>id. </em>at 155. Even if we were to accept the Pattersons\u2019 characterization that, absent the annual payment, the church doors would not have been open to the public free of charge, it would not change the fact that no charge or fee was imposed on them in this case. See <em>id. </em>at 154-155.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">Finally, the Pattersons claim that the defendants should be denied protection from liability because nothing in the recreational use statute or its legislative history indicates the Legislature\u2019s intent to immunize defendants who generate revenue on private property. We disagree. When interpreting a statute, we consider the text \u201cthe principal source of insight into Legislative purpose.\u201d <em>Providence &amp; Worcester R.R. </em>v. <em>Energy Facilities Siting Bd., </em>453 Mass. 135, 142 (2009) (citation omitted). Here, we must follow the statute\u2019s unambiguous language because doing so yields neither an absurd result nor one contrary to the manifest intention of the Legislature. See <em>ibid. </em>See also <em>Ali </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>441 Mass, at 238 (the statute\u2019s purpose is \u201cto encourage landowners to permit broad, public, free use of land for recreational purposes\u201d). The plain text of the statute does not require that the defendants be excluded from protection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>against liability because they generate revenue on the church property, and our judicial function does not permit us to read the Pattersons\u2019 proposed limiting language into the statute. See <em>King </em>v. <em>Viscoloid Co., </em>219 Mass. 420, 425 (1914) (we may not \u201cread into the statute a provision which the Legislature did not see fit to put there\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">Furthermore, we decline the invitation to interpret the statute based on case law from other jurisdictions. \u201cWhere, as here, the language of the statute is clear, it is the function of the judiciary to apply it, not amend it.\u201d <em>Commissioner of Rev. </em>v. <em>Cargill, Inc., </em>429 Mass. 79, 82 (1999). Had the Legislature intended to limit the recreational use statute in the manner advocated by the Pattersons, it could have done so. See <em>ibid. </em>Consequently, the defendants are entitled to immunity from the negligence claims as a matter of law under G. L. c. 21, \u00a7 17C.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">2. <em>Claims under the consumer protection act.</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark><em> </em>General Laws c. 93A, \u00a7 <em>2(a), </em>inserted by St. 1967, c. 813, \u00a7 1, declares unlawful: \u201cunfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce.\u201d The Pattersons allege that the church and the foundation are liable under G. L. c. 93A because when Linda was injured in the pew box, the church was not in compliance with certain Architectural Access Board (AAB) accessibility requirements. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">a. <em>General liability. </em>For the purposes of summary judgment, we accept the Pattersons\u2019 contention that the pew boxes did not conform to certain regulations promulgated by the AAB concerning floor surface accessibility.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> But, a \u201cnegligent act standing by itself does not give rise to a claim under c. 93A.\u201d <em>Squeri </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>v. <em>McCarrick, </em>32 Mass. App. Ct. 203, 207 (1992). \u201cThere must in addition be evidence that the negligence was or resulted in an unfair or deceptive act or practice.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>In the light most favorable to the Pattersons, no characterization of the evidence could give rise to a finding that the defendants\u2019 maintenance of the raised pew boxes was an \u201cunfair or deceptive\u201d act under c. 93A. See <em>PMP Assocs. </em>v. <em>Globe Newspaper Co., </em>366 Mass. 593, 596 (1975) (an act is unfair if it falls within established concepts of unfairness, or is \u201cimmoral, unethical, oppressive, or unscrupulous\u201d). The judge properly determined that \u201cthe defendants\u2019 actions at most could be construed as negligent supervision of a renovation project, which they contracted with an architectural firm to perform.\u201d There is no evidence that the defendants intentionally failed to comply with the AAB accessibility requirements or engaged in fraud or deceit while encouraging church visitors to sit in the pew boxes. See <em>Poly </em>v. <em>Moylan, </em>423 Mass. 141, 151 (1996), cert, denied, 519 U.S. 1114 (1997) (negligent conduct, without \u201cdishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation\u201d did not give rise to c. 93A violation). This case lacks the coercive and \u201c[ijntentionally gainful misconduct\u201d that is often central to c. 93A wrongdoing. See <em>McGonagle </em>v. <em>Home Depot U.S.A., Inc., </em>75 Mass. App. Ct. 593, 600 n.9 (2009). The judge properly determined that any failure by the defendants to maintain the pew boxes in compliance with AAB regulations did not rise to the level of unfair or deceptive conduct.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">Furthermore, the Pattersons failed to establish a connection between the alleged misconduct and the defendants\u2019 business activities. See <em>id. </em>at 599-600 (test is whether the misconduct serves the actor\u2019s financial benefit or gain). \u201cThe purpose of G. L. c. 93A is to improve the commercial relationship between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>consumers and business persons and to encourage more equitable behavior in the marketplace.\u201d <em>Poznik </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Med. Professional Ins. Assn., </em>417 Mass. 48, 53 (1994). Here, the Pattersons\u2019 claim that the defendants\u2019 renovations, which included the \u201cplacement of carpet that effectively hid the similarly-colored tripping hazard\u201d in the pew risers was \u201cpart of the Defendants\u2019 efforts to run the money-making tourist attraction,\u201d is not supported by the record. There is no evidence that the condition of the pew box risers or choice of red paint or red carpet provided a business incentive for the defendants. Linda fell in the church sanctuary while participating in a free tour. Nothing in the record suggests that any possible negligence by the defendants related to an entrepreneurial aspect of the church or foundation. See <em>Darviris </em>v. <em>Petros, </em>442 Mass. 274, 280 (2004). As the judge properly noted, although the defendants may be engaging in business activities through their fee-related behind-the-scenes tours and their gift shop operations, these operations had nothing whatsoever to do with Linda\u2019s fall.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">b. <em>Liability under the Attorney General\u2019s regulation. </em>Pursuant to 940 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 3.16(3) (1993) (the Attorney General\u2019s Regulation),<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> an act or practice violates G. L. c. 93A if: \u201cIt fails to comply with existing statutes, rules, regulations or laws, meant for the protection of the public\u2019s health, safety, or welfare promulgated by the Commonwealth or any political subdivision thereof intended to provide the consumers of this Commonwealth protection . . . .\u201d The Pattersons contend that under the AAB regulations, \u201clevel changes of 3 and V2 to 4 inches, such as that confronted by [Linda] at the pew entry, were not permissible.\u201d They claim that the absence of an \u201caccessible route\u201d required by 521 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 20.1, denied Linda an unobstructed path inside the church. The Pattersons then make a conclusory argument that the Attorney General\u2019s Regulation \u201csquarely places the involved statutory and regulatory violations within the scope of G. L. c. 93A.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">In <em>Klairmont </em>v. <em>Gainsboro Restaurant, Inc., </em>465 Mass. 165, 174 (2013), the Supreme Judicial Court noted that \u201ca violation of the building code[] will be a violation of c. 93A, \u00a7 <em>2(a), </em>only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>if the conduct leading to the violation is both unfair or deceptive and occurs in trade or commerce.\u201d As we have previously explained, the alleged violations here were not unfair or deceptive. See <em>Darviris </em>v. Petros, 442 Mass, at 281 (Attorney General\u2019s rule-making power under c. 93A, \u00a7 2[c], limited to \u201cconcepts of deception or unfairness\u201d). Here, unlike in <em>Klairmont, </em>there is no evidence, or even an assertion that the \u201cdefendants knowingly failed to acquire . . . required permits in order to avoid the expense of building code compliance.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>Klairmont </em>v. <em>Gainsboro Restaurant, Inc., supra </em>at 176. Moreover, despite its broad terms, the Attorney General\u2019s Regulation is bound by \u201cthe substantive limitation that the law or regulation at issue must be intended to protect consumers.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 174. The AAB regulations cited by the Pattersons are not directed at the protection of consumers in the marketplace, but instead regulate building accessibility. The purpose of the regulations is to ensure that public buildings are accessible to, functional, and safe for persons with disabilities. See 521 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 2.1 (1996). The fact that the AAB regulations may aim to protect \u201cthe public\u2019s health, safety or welfare,\u201d 940 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 3.16(3), does not mean that every instance of noncompliance constitutes a violation of c. 93A. See <em>Klairmont </em>v. <em>Gainsboro Restaurant, Inc., supra </em>at 173.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The final limiting phrase of the Attorney General\u2019s Regulation requires the violated legal provision to be one aimed at providing consumers protection. <em>McGonagle </em>v. <em>Home Depot U.S.A., Inc., </em>75 Mass. App. Ct. at 601. The failure to conform the church\u2019s pew boxes to the AAB regulations is an infraction too attenuated from the protection of <em>consumers </em>to constitute a violation of the Attorney General\u2019s Regulation. See <em>ibid. </em>Such an \u201coverbroad reading of 940 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 3.16(3) would \u2018siphon into the province of c. 93A a bottomless reservoir of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>ulterior public health, safety, and welfare infractions regulated by separate programs of the police power.\u2019 \u201d <em>Klairmont </em>v. <em>Gainsboro Restaurant, Inc., supra </em>at 177, quoting from <em>McGonagle </em>v. <em>Home Depot U.S.A., Inc., supra </em>at 601.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b190-12\">The judge also entered summary judgment for the defendants on Kenneth\u2019s claim for loss of consortium on the basis that his claim could not survive the judgment for the defendants on Linda\u2019s negligence claims. See <em>Sena </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>417 Mass. 250, 264 (1994). On appeal, the Pattersons have made no separate argument with respect to the loss of consortium claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b191-8\">Christ Church is a nonprofit corporation that manages the church and its use for worship by its Episcopal congregation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b192-7\">At the time of Linda\u2019s accident, G.

See G. L. c. 21, \u00a7 17C. Indeed, if this were true, any lessor who qualified for protection but earned an economic benefit from the lease would be barred from asserting the statute as a defense. Such a result would conflict with the clear language of the statute.
