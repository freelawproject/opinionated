The board had granted the Chandlers a special permit allowing them to reconstruct a pre-existing nonconforming structure on their nonconforming lot. In reversing the board\u2019s decision, the judge determined that because the proposed new structure\u2019s increased height created a new, additional nonconformity, distinct from the pre-existing dimensional and coverage nonconformities, a variance was required. We agree with the judge\u2019s decision that a variance would be required if the proposed increase in height constitutes an additional nonconformity not otherwise exempted by the town by-law. However, we also conclude that the judge erroneously concluded that the board had determined that the Chandlers\u2019 project is ineligible for the exemption from certain height limits created by \u00a7 IV.A.3 of the Chatham bylaw.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Consequently, we vacate the entry of summary judgment and remand the matter for further proceedings before the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">1. <em>Facts. </em>The following undisputed facts are taken from the summary judgment record. On July 1, 2005, the Chandlers purchased property, located at 24 Windmill Lane in Chatham, containing a single-family home (old structure). The old structure was built in approximately 1929 and is located within a residential R-40 district and in a coastal conservancy district.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The old structure is 19.2 feet high above grade, and contains 2,161 square feet of living space. The Chandlers\u2019 property is nonconforming as to lot size and building coverage, and contains <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>additional dimensional nonconformities with respect to its frontage, front yard setback, and side yard setback.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">In November, 2007, the Chandlers filed an application for a special permit seeking to raze the old structure and replace it with a new structure. The new structure, as proposed, will contain an additional 529 square feet of living space on substantially the same footprint as the old structure.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The new structure maintains the same nonconformities as the old structure with respect to frontage, setbacks, lot size, and building coverage. However, the height of the new structure is 27.2 feet above grade and, therefore, exceeds the maximum allowable height of twenty feet in the coastal conservancy district.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">Part of this height increase is due to the property\u2019s location in a \u201cvelocity zone\u201d as designated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), which mandates pilings instead of a foundation. Pursuant to FEMA regulations, any \u201csubstantial improvement\u201d to a structure located within a velocity zone must be built on pilings with an elevation above the 100-year flood elevation.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The proposed height of the new structure, not including the FEMA foundation, is 23.5 feet above flood elevation.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">2. <em>Procedural history. </em>On December 31, 2007, John V.C. Saylor, Georgia A. Saylor, Peter Hallock, Edwin J. Deadrick, and Mary Anne Hall Deadrick filed their complaint appealing from the board\u2019s decision to grant a special permit to the Chandlers, pursuant to G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 17.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The plaintiffs filed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>a second amended complaint<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> on March 5, 2008, which added a count under G. L. c. 240, \u00a7 14A, seeking an interpretation of \u00a7 V.B and \u00a7 IV.A.3 of the Chatham zoning bylaws.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">Thereafter, both parties filed cross motions for summary judgment. A judge of the Land Court allowed the Chandlers\u2019 motion, concluding that the plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge the special permit. However, in <em>Hallock </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Chatham, </em>80 Mass. App. Ct. 1104 (2011), an unpublished decision pursuant to rule 1:28 (2011 decision), a panel of this court determined that the Deadricks had standing, and remanded the case to the Land Court.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">On remand, both parties renewed their cross motions for summary judgment. In a decision dated February 21, 2013, the Land Court judge allowed the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment and reversed the board\u2019s decision granting the special permit. The judge reasoned that, since the new structure created an additional nonconformity as to its height, the project required a variance rather than a special permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">On March 6, 2013, the Chandlers filed a motion for reconsideration, or in the alternative, for a ruling on their pending motion for entry of final judgment, arguing that the 2011 decision of this court had determined the merits of the case favorably to them. On April 9, 2013, the Chandlers also filed a motion under Mass.R.Civ.P. 60(b), 365 Mass. 828 (1974), seeking relief from the judgment on the basis that the last surviving original plaintiff, Mary Anne Deadrick, had died in July, 2012, resulting in a \u201cgap in the title.\u201d Thus, the Chandlers claimed that the judgment should be vacated and the complaint dismissed for lack of an aggrieved party at the time the judgment entered. In response, Mary Anne Hall Deadrick\u2019s daughter, Sara Dead-rick Frye (Frye), acting in her capacity as executor of her mother\u2019s estate, filed a motion under Mass.R.Civ.P. 17(a), as amended, 454 Mass. 1401 (1982), to be substituted as plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>for her deceased mother. On the same day, Sara Deadrick Frye and Mary Anne Hall Deadrick\u2019s other children, Stuart Hall Deadrick and Spencer Hall Deadrick (collectively the Deadrick children), appearing in their individual capacities, filed a motion under Mass.R.Civ.P. 20(a), 365 Mass. 766 (1974), seeking to be joined as plaintiffs in this action.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The motions for substitution and joinder were allowed on April 30, 2013, but the Land Court judge took under advisement the Chandlers\u2019 rule 60(b) motion on the issue of the Deadrick children\u2019s standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">In an order dated June 4, 2013, the judge determined that, because the Deadrick children had some ownership interest in the property from the outset of the dispute, they shared the same harm as their parents. Therefore, the judge concluded the Deadrick children had standing because this court previously had determined that their parents\u2019 harm was a basis for standing. In the same order, the judge denied the Chandlers\u2019 motion for reconsideration, noting that the 2011 decision was limited to the issue of standing. The judge also rejected the Chandlers\u2019 additional argument that \u00a7 IV.A.3 of the Chatham bylaw, discussed <em>infra, </em>permitted the Chandlers to exceed the applicable maximum height restriction. The judge concluded that the board had determined that the new structure constituted an \u201cexpansion\u201d under \u00a7 IV.A.3 of the bylaw, and therefore was ineligible for its exemption from applicable height restrictions; he also expressed his view that if the board had determined that it was not an expansion, such a decision would be arbitrary and capricious. In any event, the judge ruled that the height exemption provided by \u00a7 IV.A.3 was inapplicable, so that the new structure\u2019s increased height created a new nonconformity requiring a variance.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">3. <em>Discussion. </em>\u201cWe review the Land Court judge\u2019s summary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>judgment decision de nova. Because the judge does not engage in fact finding in ruling on cross motions for summary judgment, we owe no deference to his assessment of the record.\u201d <em>Marhefka </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Sutton, </em>79 Mass. App. Ct. 515, 517 (2011) (footnote and citations omitted). Turning to the merits of the Chandlers\u2019 appeal,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> we first consider whether the judge correctly decided two issues: (1) whether the board considered the applicability of \u00a7 IV.A.3 of the bylaw to the new structure, while weighing the Chandler\u2019s application for a special permit, and (2) whether the addition of new nonconformities to a pre-existing nonconforming residential structure require a variance or special permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">On remand after the 2011 decision, the judge properly recognized that the decision was limited to the issue of standing. Specifically, the judge correctly understood that he needed to determine if the board had ruled on the applicability of \u00a7 IV.A.3 of Chatham\u2019s zoning bylaw to the new structure; as he stated: \u201cThe first issue is whether the ZBA made a finding as to whether or not the New structure was an expansion of the Old structure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">Section IV.A.3 of the bylaw exempts certain structures from otherwise applicable height restrictions if FEMA regulations require the additional height. See note 5, <em>supra. </em>Accordingly, if the new structure is not an \u201cexpansion\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 IV.A.3, then it qualifies for the exemption created by that section from the otherwise applicable twenty-foot height restriction. The increased height would not be a new nonconformity, and the Chandlers may proceed under their special permit. However, in denying the Chandlers\u2019 motion for reconsideration, the judge concluded that the zoning board had already found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>the new structure to be an \u201cexpansion,\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 IV.A.3 and, therefore, confirmed his conclusion that the Chandlers\u2019 project required a variance rather than a special permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">The question of the applicability of \u00a7 IV.A.3 to the new structure is significant. As discussed below, we conclude that the Land Court judge correctly ruled that the creation of a new nonconformity in a preexisting nonconforming structure requires a variance, and not just a special permit based on substantial detriment pursuant to the second sentence of G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 6. Accordingly, if the new structure is ineligible for the exemption created by \u00a7 IV.A.3, it requires a variance and the board\u2019s decision granting a special permit for the project would be invalid. Conversely, if the new structure is eligible for the exemption created by \u00a7 IV.A.3, it does not require a variance and the project may proceed by special permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">a. <em>Applicability of \u00a7 IV.A.3 to the new structure. </em>As we have observed, the Land Court judge correctly recognized that his first task following the remand ordered by the 2011 decision was to determine whether the board considered and determined the applicability of \u00a7 IV.A.3 to the new structure in its special permit decision. \u201c[Ajlthough interpretation of the by-law is in the last analysis a judicial function, deference is owed to a local zoning board\u2019s home grown knowledge about the history and purpose of its town\u2019s zoning by-law.\u201d <em>Duteau </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Webster, </em>47 Mass. App. Ct. 664,669 (1999). \u201cReviewing courts will interpret zoning by-laws \u2018in accordance with ordinary principles of statutory construction, with some measure of deference given to the board\u2019s interpretation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Eastern Point, LLC </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Gloucester, </em>74 Mass. App. Ct. 481, 486 (2009), quoting from <em>APT Asset Mgmt., Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Melrose, </em>50 Mass. App. Ct. 133, 138 (2000). Accordingly, the interpretation of the application of a provision of a local zoning by-law to a request for a special permit ordinarily should be undertaken in the first instance by the local board acting as the special permit granting authority, and only thereafter subject to judicial review within the context of an appeal pursuant to G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">We disagree, however, with the Land Court judge\u2019s conclu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>sion that the board considered and determined the applicability of \u00a7 IV.A.3 to the new structure in its special permit decision. The board\u2019s decision does not expressly refer to \u00a7 IV.A.3. Nor does it appear that the board\u2019s use of the term \u201cexpand\u201d within its decision was intended to express a conclusion that the new structure constitutes an \u201cexpansion\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 IV.A.3, making the new structure ineligible for the height exemption it provides.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Instead, when the board\u2019s decision is considered as a whole, we conclude that its use of the word \u201cexpand,\u201d in two places, was merely descriptive, in a general sense, of the new structure proposed by the Chandlers\u2019 application for a special permit. The board\u2019s only mention of height was in the board\u2019s finding that the height was \u201cnot out of scale for the neighborhood.\u201d Significantly, even this single finding was within the board\u2019s analysis of whether the new structure was substantially more detrimental to the neighborhood. In fact, the board\u2019s decision appears to focus principally, if not exclusively, on whether the new structure would be \u201csubstantially more detrimental to the neighborhood,\u201d under the rubric of G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 6. We conclude that the board did not consider or determine the applicability of \u00a7 IV.A.3 to the new structure in its special permit decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">As we have observed, zoning is a local matter, and questions of interpretation of the local zoning bylaw ordinarily are matters for the local board charged with administration of the bylaw, with some deference thereafter due to the board\u2019s resulting interpretation. Here, however, there was no initial determination by the board as to the applicability of \u00a7 IV.A.3 to the Chandlers\u2019 new structure.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">Moreover, whether the new structure is an expansion under \u00a7 IV.A.3 is at least a mixed question of law and fact. As such, the proper application of \u00a7 IV.A.3 to the particularities of the new structure depends to a great extent on what the municipality intended to achieve by enactment of that section. Since \u201c[t]he object of all statutory construction is to ascertain the true <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>intent of the Legislature from the words used. If a liberal, even if not literally exact, interpretation of certain words is necessary to accomplish the purpose indicated by the words as a whole, such interpretation is to be adopted rather than one which will defeat that purpose.\u201d <em>Dennis Hous. Corp. </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Dennis, </em>439 Mass. 71, 83 (2003), quoting from <em>Champigny </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>422 Mass. 249, 251 (1996). Given the board\u2019s local, particularized \u201chome grown\u201d knowledge, we conclude that the board is entitled here to interpret its own bylaw in the first instance.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> See <em>Duteau </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Webster, </em>47 Mass. App. Ct. at 669.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">b. <em>The addition of new nonconformities to a pre-existing nonconforming residential structure requires a variance. </em>Although we conclude that the matter should be remanded to the board, we nonetheless consider whether the Land Court judge correctly concluded that introduction of a new nonconformity to a pre-existing nonconforming residential structure requires a variance, because the question has been fully briefed and argued and because, as noted above, if the Land Court judge was incorrect in his conclusion there would be no need for a remand; the board\u2019s special permit decision alone would be sufficient to allow the Chandler\u2019s project to proceed, without regard to the applicability of \u00a7 IV.A.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">As stated above, the new structure will keep many of the preexisting nonconformities of the old structure but, if not exempt under \u00a7 IV.A.3 of the by-law, it will create an <em>additional </em>nonconformity with respect to height. Consequently, the judge determined that the addition of a new nonconformity required a variance rather than a special permit. The Chandlers challenge this interpretation, arguing that both new and existing nonconformities fall under the purview of a special permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">\u201cIn resolving this dispute, we are again called on to interpret the \u2018difficult and infelicitous\u2019 language of the first two sentences of G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 6, as they pertain to single or two-family <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>residential structures.\u201d <em>Gale </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Gloucester, </em>80 Mass. App. Ct. 331, 336-337 (2011) <em>(Gale), </em>quoting from <em>Fitzsimonds </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Chatham, </em>21 Mass. App. Ct. 53, 55 (1985). General Laws c. 40A, \u00a7 6, provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-5\">\u201cExcept as hereinafter provided, a zoning ordinance or by-law shall not apply to structures or uses lawfully in existence or lawfully begun, or to a building or special permit issued before the first publication of notice of the public hearing on such ordinance or by-law required by section five, but shall apply to any change or substantial extension of such use, to a building or special permit issued after the first notice of said public hearing, to any reconstruction, extension or structural change of such structure and to any alteration of a structure begun after the first notice of said public hearing to provide for its use for a substantially different purpose or for the same purpose in a substantially different manner or to a substantially greater extent <em>except where alteration, reconstruction, extension or structural change to a single or two-family residential structure does not increase the nonconforming nature of said structure. </em>Pre-existing nonconforming structures or uses may be extended or altered, provided, that no such extension or alteration shall be permitted unless there is a finding by the permit granting authority or by the special permit granting authority designated by ordinance or by-law that such change, extension or alteration shall not be substantially more detrimental than the existing nonconforming use to the neighborhood.\u201d (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">The highlighted portion above is often referred to as the second \u201cexcept\u201d clause. <em>Fitzsimonds </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Chatham, supra </em>at 56. To our knowledge, the issue whether existing nonconformities and the creation of new nonconformities should be treated differently under the second except clause of c. 40A, \u00a7 6, has not been directly addressed by any appellate court. However, in <em>Gale, supra </em>at 337, this court summarized the general standard for cases concerning the second except clause:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-7\">\u201c[U]nder the second \u2018except\u2019 clause of . . . the statute, as concerns single or two-family residential structures, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>permit granting authority must identify the particular respect or respects in which the existing structure does not conform to the present bylaw and then determine whether the proposed alteration or addition would <em>intensify the existing nonconformities or result in additional ones. </em>... If the answer to that question is in the affirmative, a finding of no substantial detriment under the second sentence is required.\u201d (Quotations and citations omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">Citing the above language, the Land Court judge noted that \u201c [a]t first blush, it appears this statement in <em>Gale </em>does not distinguish between reconstruction that results in increased existing nonconformities, versus creating new, additional nonconformities.\u201d However, after careful review of the relevant case law, the judge concluded that while intensifying existing nonconformities requires a special permit, the creation of new nonconformities requires a variance. A similar review of relevant cases also is helpful here.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">In <em>Gale, supra, </em>we determined that the reconstruction of a pre-existing nonconforming residential structure required a special permit to increase or intensify a pre-existing nonconformity. There, the plaintiffs appealed from the entry of summary judgment dismissing their challenge to the board\u2019s grant of a special permit to the defendant, their neighbor. <em>Id. </em>at 332. The defendant\u2019s proposed new structure had a larger footprint than the previous structure and increased the setback nonconformities. <em>Ibid. </em>This court upheld the entry of summary judgment, concluding that the board\u2019s grant of a special permit, based upon its finding of no substantial detriment to the neighborhood, was all that was required. <em>Id. </em>at 337.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">Prior to <em>Gale, </em>in <em>Bransford </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Edgartown, </em>444 Mass. 852, 853 (2005), Justice Greaney, in a concurring opinion of an equally divided Supreme Judicial Court, determined that only a special permit, with the requisite finding that the proposed structure was not substantially more detrimental to the neighborhood, was required to increase or exacerbate an existing nonconformity.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> There, the plaintiff wanted to build a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>new house which conformed to the zoning by-law\u2019s structural requirements, but nonetheless doubled the size of the old structure on a undersized nonconforming lot. <em>Id. </em>at 853-854. Because the expansion of the structure\u2019s footprint on an undersized lot exacerbated the nonconformity, the court found that a finding of no substantial detriment was required under the second sentence of \u00a7 6. <em>Id. </em>at 861-862. The court then upheld the board\u2019s denial of a special permit as it was within the board\u2019s discretion to find that the new structure was substantially more detrimental to the neighborhood. <em>Id. </em>at 862.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">Therefore, as the Land Court judge noted, \u201cin <em>Gale </em>and <em>Bransford, </em>the Appeals Court and the Supreme Judicial Court, respectively, were faced with the issue of an extension to a preexisting nonconformity and those courts properly limited their final holdings to such circumstances.\u201d See <em>Gale, supra </em>at 338 <em>(\u201cBransford </em>holds that exterior alterations or reconstructions of single or two-family residential structure that increase or intensify any pre-existing nonconformities may be authorized by means of a finding of no substantial detriment under the second sentence of the first paragraph of \u00a7 6\u201d). Nonetheless, some confusion arises from the seminal formulation of the operation of the second except clause articulated in <em>Willard </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Orleans, </em>25 Mass. App. Ct. 15, 21-22 (1987): \u201c[T]he [second \u2018except\u2019 clause] should be read as requiring a board of appeals[<footnotemark>17</footnotemark>] to identify the particular respect or respects in which the existing structure does not conform to the requirements of the present by-law and then determine whether the proposed alteration or addition would intensify the existing nonconformities or <em>result in additional ones.'\u2019\u2019\u2019</em></p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">It is important to observe at this juncture that the second \u201cexcept\u201d clause is directed to differentiating between those changes to nonconforming residential structures that may be made as of right, and those that require a finding of no substantial detriment under the second sentence of \u00a7 6. <em>Bransford, </em>for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>example, was concerned principally with determining whether a particular change \u201cincreased the nonconforming nature\u201d of the residential structure at issue. 444 Mass, at 857. In the present case, it is undisputed that the new structure will increase the nonconforming nature of the old structure. The question, then, is not whether the second \u201cexcept\u201d clause authorizes the Chandlers\u2019 project as a matter of right, without a finding of no substantial detriment, but whether a finding of no substantial detriment under the second sentence of \u00a7 6 may authorize the creation of new nonconformities in a pre-existing nonconforming structure. Although we are aware of no appellate case resolving that question in the context of a residential structure, the Supreme Judicial Court has twice concluded that the creation of a new nonconformity in a pre-existing commercial structure requires a variance.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">In <em>Rockwood </em>v. <em>Snow Inn Corp., </em>409 Mass. 361, 362, 370 (1991), the board of appeals granted the defendant a special permit to extend two prior nonconforming structures, which were nonconforming as to setback. <em>Id. </em>at 362. However, in addition to the setback violation, the proposed new structures also violated the by-law\u2019s lot coverage requirement. <em>Ibid. </em>Because the violation of the lot coverage requirement created a new, additional nonconformity, the court reversed the grant of the special permit. <em>Id. </em>at 370. In reaching its conclusion, the court observed that the first sentence of \u00a7 6 provides that the existing by-law \u201cshall apply\u201d to any extension, reconstruction, or alteration of a pre-existing nonconforming structure. Accordingly, the court concluded, the authority to alter an existing nonconforming structure upon a finding of no substantial detriment under the second sentence of \u00a7 6 can apply only to changes which themselves conform to the existing by-law, and then only if they are not substantially more detrimental to the neighborhood. In reaching its conclusion, the court observed that \u201ceven as to a single or two-family residence, structures to which the statute appears to give special protection, the zoning ordinance or by-law applies to a reconstruction, extension, or change that \u2018would intensify the existing nonconformities or result in additional ones.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 364, quoting from <em>Willard, </em>25 Mass. App. Ct. at 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>To similar effect is <em>Wrona </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Pittsfield, </em>338 Mass. 87, 89-90 (1958), a case decided under the prior version of c. 40A.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> In that case, the Supreme Judicial Court determined that a planned extension to a motor freight terminal that was both a pre-existing nonconforming use and structure required a variance. There, the defendant received a special permit to build an extension to his motor freight terminal located in a single residence district. <em>Id. </em>at 87-90. The Supreme Judicial Court, however, reversed because the defendant\u2019s proposed extension also violated the by-law\u2019s setback requirements. <em>Id. </em>at 89. Thus, the court concluded that \u201c[t]he board could properly have allowed an extension of the nonconforming use up to the setback lines . . . [hjowever when it permitted the extension beyond the very precise setback requirements contained the ordinance it exceeded its authority.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">Applied strictly to residential structures, the holding in <em>Rock-wood </em>would require a variance even for extensions of existing nonconformities; its holding is that \u201c[i]f the first and second sentences [of c. 40A, \u00a7 6,] are read together, the statute permits extensions and changes to nonconforming structures if (1) the extensions or changes themselves comply with the ordinance or by-law, and (2) the structures as extended or changed are found to be not substantially more detrimental to the neighborhood than the preexisting nonconforming structure or structures.\u201d <em>Rockwood </em>v. <em>Snow Inn Corp., </em>409 Mass, at 364. However, a long line of cases, notably including <em>Bransford </em>and <em>Bjorklund, </em>have held that an alteration which intensifies an existing nonconformity in a <em>residential </em>structure may be authorized under the second sentence of \u00a7 6 upon a finding of no substantial detriment. See <em>Gale </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Gloucester, </em>80 Mass. App. Ct. at 338, distinguishing <em>Rockwood </em>v. <em>Snow Inn Corp., </em>on the ground that it dealt with a commercial structure rather than a residential one.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">As the Supreme Judicial Court made clear in <em>Bransford, </em>444 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>Mass, at 859, \u201cthe ultimate objectives of zoning would be furthered by the eventual elimination of nonconformities in most cases.\u201d (Citation omitted.) See <em>Strazzula </em>v. <em>Building Inspector of Wellesley, </em>357 Mass. 694, 697 (1970), cert, denied, 400 U.S. 1004 (1971) (considering eventual elimination of nonconforming uses as an objective underlying zoning regulations). As the plaintiffs observe, the fallacy of the Chandlers\u2019 contention that an alteration creating a new nonconformity may be authorized upon a finding of no substantial detriment is illustrated by contrasting a landowner with a <em>conforming </em>structure who wishes to construct an addition that violates the applicable setback requirements (which would require a variance) with a neighboring landowner with a <em>nonconforming </em>structure as to height who also wishes to construct an identical addition, also encroaching to the same extent into the required setback (which, according to the Chandlers, would require only a finding of no substantial detriment). Such a result is illogical, given the significantly more stringent burden for a variance, which is granted \u201conly in rare instances and under exceptional circumstances,\u201d <em>Blackman </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Barnstable, </em>334 Mass. 446, 450 (1956), quoting from <em>Hammond </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Springfield, </em>257 Mass. 446, 448 (1926), compared to the lesser burden for a special permit. See <em>Kiss </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Longmeadow, </em>371 Mass. 147, 153-154 (1976), and cases cited therein. \u201cIf a sensible construction is available, [a court] shall not construe a statute to make a nullity of pertinent provisions or to produce absurd results.\u201d <em>Flemings </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>431 Mass. 374, 375-376 (2000). Like the Land Court judge, we construe the provisions of the first and second sentences of \u00a7 6 together to allow extension of existing nonconformities upon a showing of no substantial detriment, but to require a variance for the creation of any new nonconformity.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\"><em>Conclusion. </em>For the reasons expressed above, the judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>granting the plaintiffs\u2019 cross motion for summary judgment and the order denying the Chandlers\u2019 motion for reconsideration are vacated. The matter is remanded to the Chatham zoning board of appeals to determine whether the Chandlers\u2019 proposed new structure is eligible for the exemption provided under \u00a7 IV.A. 3 of the Chatham by-law from otherwise applicable height limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b572-6\">As we discuss below, if the project is eligible for the exemption created by \u00a7 IV.A.3 of the bylaw, it would not create a new nonconformity and, hence, would not require a variance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b572-8\">Section IV.A.3 of the bylaw defines the coastal conservancy district as all land delineated in a 100-year flood plain, in which the Chandler property is located. Pertinent to the present case, the section also provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-9\">\u201cStructures shall not exceed twenty feet (20 feet) in height. Provided there is no expansion, those dwellings which existed prior to January 16, 1992 and are required by the Building Inspector to be elevated in accordance with FEMA regulations, shall not be required to conform to the twenty (20 foot) height restriction.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b573-8\">The footprint of the new structure pushes outward from that of the old structure to a total of twenty-eight feet and would include a squaring off of a twenty-eight square foot notch between the old structure and attached garage, two small entrance porches in the front yard, and two small proposed patios in the rear.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b573-9\">The 100-year flood elevation, as it applies to the locus, is approximately twelve feet.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b573-10\">The Chandlers argue that FEMA regulations, as incorporated into the State building code, required them to raise the new structure\u2019s heating, air conditioning and hot water systems, and electrical and plumbing fixtures and equipment above the 100-year flood evaluation. The Chandlers claim that these mechanicals, located in the basement of the old structure, would have to be placed in the attic of the new structure thereby contributing to the new structure\u2019s increased height.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b573-11\">After the death of John Saylor, the Land Court judge allowed the plaintiffs\u2019 assented to motion to remove John V.C.

The 2011 decision also dismissed a second count of the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint, which sought a declaration under G. L. c. 240, \u00a7 14A, on procedural grounds. Accordingly, the only remaining issue before the judge on remand was the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal of the special permit pursuant to G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 17.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b575-7\">Accompanying the motions was the affidavit of Sara Deadrick Frye, in which she disclosed to the court that she and her siblings each held some ownership interest in the Deadrick property throughout the litigation, which they obtained from their parents in four separate conveyances between 1991 and 1995. Frye also indicated that, upon their mother\u2019s death, she and her siblings succeeded to the remaining interest in the property held by their mother at the time of her death. Lastly, Frye explained that she and her siblings were well aware of the litigation and shared the same concerns that their parents had regarding the much larger house proposed on the Chandler lot and the effect the proposed house would have on their ocean views.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b576-7\">On appeal, the Chandlers ask us to reconsider our previous 2011 decision, <em>Hallock </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Chatham, </em>80 Mass. App. Ct. 1104 (2011), where a panel of this court determined that the Deadricks had standing. We decline to revisit the issue. The Chandlers also challenge standing on the grounds that the original Deadrick plaintiffs are now deceased and the substituted plaintiffs, the Deadrick children, do not have standing because they do not live on the locus. Like the Land Court judge, we reject this argument. From the onset of this case the Deadrick children have had some ownership interest in house. As such, the Deadrick children have the same harm as their parents, which we already determined was an adequate basis for standing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b578-7\">Indeed, the plaintiffs do not contend otherwise. In their brief here, they stated: \u201cThe board considered the application solely under Section V.B. and did not address either Section IV.A.3.a or Section IV.A.b.d.l. The board did not address the height issue at all.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b579-8\">Our opinion is not intended to be read as an expression of any conclusion regarding the question whether the new structure is eligible for the exemption provided by \u00a7 IV.A.3 of the bylaw. We disagree, however, with the conclusion by the Land Court judge that an interpretation by the board that the new structure qualifies for the exemption furnished by \u00a7 IV.A.3 would be unreasonable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b581-8\">In <em>Bjorklund </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Norwell, </em>450 Mass. 357, 357-358 (2008), the court adopted the reasoning of the concurring opinion in <em>Bransford.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b582-7\">Justice Greaney\u2019s concurrence in <em>Bransford </em>(which as we have observed was subsequently adopted by a majority of the court in <em>Bjorklund </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Norwell, </em>see note 16, supra) expressed the view that the initial determination should be made by the building inspector rather than the board of appeals.

Section V.B. does not have such a broad scope. Instead, it merely indicates that a vertical addition that is confined to the structure\u2019s existing footprint may still call for a special <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>permit.
