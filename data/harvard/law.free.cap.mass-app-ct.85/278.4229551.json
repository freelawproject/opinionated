The complainant is the defendant\u2019s stepdaughter. The convictions were upheld on direct appeal. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Aspen, </em>53 Mass. App. Ct. 259 (2001).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendant moved for a new trial, asserting various claims, including ineffective assistance of trial counsel and ineffective assistance of appellate counsel. The motion was denied. The defendant appeals.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We now reverse the order denying the motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>1. <em>Ineffective assistance of trial counsel. </em>The defendant contends that trial counsel was ineffective in (1) failing to call an expert witness to rebut the Commonwealth\u2019s expert, (2) failing to call available character witnesses, (3) advising the defendant not to testify,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and (4) failing to do more to impeach both the complainant and her mother.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">We apply the familiar test of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saferian, </em>366 Mass. 89, 96 (1974). \u201cWe also consider whether there is \u2018some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>showing that better work might have accomplished something material for the defense.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Baran, </em>74 Mass. App. Ct. 256, 272 (2009), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Satterfield, </em>373 Mass. 109, 115 (1977). \u201cA strategic or tactical decision by counsel will not be considered ineffective assistance unless that decision was \u2018manifestly unreasonable\u2019 when made.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Acevedo, </em>446 Mass. 435, 442 (2006), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>374 Mass. 722, 728 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">a. <em>Failure to call an expert witness. </em>First, the defendant asserts that trial counsel provided ineffective assistance in failing to call his expert witness, Dr. Reneau Kennedy, to rebut the testimony of the Commonwealth\u2019s expert, Dr. Renee Brant. At trial, Dr. Brant testified as to general characteristics common to children who have been victims of sexual abuse. Those characteristics matched those collectively known as \u201cChild Sexual Abuse Accommodation Syndrome\u201d (CSAAS). Trial counsel, instead of calling a competing expert to rebut Dr. Brant\u2019s testimony, attempted to discredit Dr. Brant through cross-examination. This strategy was not manifestly unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">In her affidavit, Dr. Kennedy asserted that had she been allowed to testify, she would have explained that CSAAS was developed as a clinical observation tool rather than as a diagnostic tool and that it was \u201cnot intended to be used as proof that a child has been abused\u201d but that it rather \u201cexplains . . . reactions to the assumed abuse.\u201d She would have testified also that it was not developed through any accepted scientific methodology and not peer reviewed. The defendant contends that without his expert, trial counsel was \u201cunable to counterbalance the critically important and powerful opinions given by the Commonwealth\u2019s expert[] \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u25a0\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Baran, 74 </em>Mass. App. Ct. at 276.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">Through thorough cross-examination, however, defense counsel brought out the facts that CSAAS is not a diagnostic device, and that it assumes the abuse has occurred and explains a child\u2019s reaction to the assumed abuse. Essentially, defense counsel was able to elicit on cross-examination most of the same facts to which Dr. Kennedy would have testified.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-8\">It has not been shown that Dr. Kennedy\u2019s testimony would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>have added materially to the defendant\u2019s case, see Acevedo, 446 Mass, at 442, quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Satterfield, </em>373 Mass, at 115 (defendant must show that \u201cbetter work might have accomplished something material for the defense\u201d), or that the tactical decision not to call her was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">b. <em>Failure to call available witnesses. </em>The decision not to call either the complainant\u2019s ex-boyfriend<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> or any of the defendant\u2019s twenty-two character witnesses was also not manifestly unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">While \u201cevidence of a defendant\u2019s general reputation is admissible, evidence in the form of private opinions is not.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Belton, </em>352 Mass. 263, 269 (1967). Moreover, once a defendant calls a witness to testify to the defendant\u2019s good reputation for a particular character trait, Massachusetts law allows the prosecutor to cross-examine that witness as to his or her awareness of any \u201crumors or reports of prior acts of misconduct by the defendant. . . that are inconsistent or conflict with the character trait to which the witness has testified.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Montanino, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. 130, 136 (1989). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>White, </em>409 Mass. 266, 276-277 (1991) (\u201cany benefits that the defendant would have realized from this testimony could not have risen to the level of a \u2018substantial ground of defence\u2019 because they would have been largely offset by the harm that other aspects of the testimony would have done to his case\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">2. <em>Ineffective assistance of appellate counsel. </em>The defendant also alleges that appellate counsel provided ineffective assistance in failing to raise on appeal a violation of the <em>Federico </em>standard. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Federico, </em>425 Mass. 844, 847 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">The standard for determining ineffective assistance of appellate counsel is the same standard set forth in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saferian, </em>366 Mass, at 96: \u201cwhether there has been serious incompetency, inefficiency, or inattention of counsel \u2014 behavior of counsel falling measurably below that which might be expected from an ordinary fallible lawyer \u2014 and, if that is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>found, then, typically, whether it has likely deprived the defendant of an otherwise available, substantial ground of defence.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cardenuto, </em>406 Mass. 450, 453-454 (1990). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Phinney, </em>446 Mass. 155, 162-163, 167-168 (2006). When assessing whether appellate counsel\u2019s behavior fell below the standard of an ordinary, fallible lawyer, we focus on whether appellate counsel \u201cfailed to raise a significant and obvious issue . . . which . . . may have resulted in a reversal of the conviction, or an order for a new trial.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sowell, </em>34 Mass. App. Ct. 229, 232 (1993), quoting from <em>Gray </em>v. <em>Greer, </em>800 F.2d 644, 646 (7th Cir. 1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">Here, defense counsel at trial had objected to testimony of the Commonwealth\u2019s expert as being in violation of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Federico, supra. </em>Expert testimony \u201cis admissible whenever it will aid the jury in reaching a decision, even if the expert\u2019s opinion touches on the ultimate issues that the jury must decide.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Federico, </em>425 Mass, at 847, quoting from <em>Simon </em>v. <em>Solomon, </em>385 Mass. 91, 105 (1982). \u201c[Testimony on the general behavioral characteristics of sexually abused children may properly be the subject of expert testimony because behavioral and emotional characteristics common to these victims are \u2018beyond the jury\u2019s common knowledge and may aid them in reaching a decision.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Federico, supra </em>at 847-848, quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Colin C., </em>419 Mass. 54, 60 (1994). \u201cSuch evidence must, however, be confined to a description of the general or typical characteristics shared by child victims of sexual abuse,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Federico, supra </em>at 848, and \u201c[djeference must be preserved for the role of the jury as the final judge of credibility . . . .\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>\u201cEvaluations of credibility are . . . within the exclusive province of the trier of fact,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Montanino, </em>409 Mass. 500, 504 (1991); \u201cwitnesses may not offer their opinions regarding the credibility of another witness.\u201d <em>Ibid., </em>quoted in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Federico, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">The Supreme Judicial Court in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Federico, </em>425 Mass, at 849, \u201cidentified several broad areas of expert testimony that are most likely to run afoul of\u201d the prohibition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>against witnesses offering their \u201copinions regarding the credibility of another witness\u201d: First, an expert may not directly refer to or compare \u201cthe behavior of the specific child complainant to general characteristics of sexual abuse victims because \u2018[s]uch testimony impermissibly intrudes on the jury\u2019s province to assess the credibility of the witness.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 848-849, quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Trowbridge, </em>419 Mass. 750, 759 (1995) . Second, the expert may not give an opinion as to whether the alleged victim was in fact subject to sexual abuse. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Federico, supra. </em>\u201cThird, with respect to the accused, the expert may not provide profiles or testimony as to the typical attributes or characteristics of the perpetrators of sexual abuse.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 850, citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Day, </em>409 Mass. 719, 724 (1991) (testimony concerning \u201cbattered child syndrome\u201d admissible, but testimony concerning \u201cprofile\u201d of child batterers inadmissible).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">Thus, testimony that \u201cexplicitly links [the expert witness\u2019s] opinion to the experience of the witness child\u201d is inadmissible. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LaCaprucia, </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. 496, 498 (1996) , quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>423 Mass. 180, 186 (1996). Further, \u201c[i]n some cases opinion testimony that does not explicitly link the opinion to the child witness nevertheless constitutes impermissible vouching.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Richardson, supra. Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LaCaprucia, supra. </em>See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Perkins, </em>39 Mass. App. Ct. 577, 582-584 (1995) (experts\u2019 testimony, in response to hypothetical questions \u201cwhose components mirrored the underlying facts of the case, would inescapably have the same impact on the jury as a direct reference to and comparison with the child witnesses in the case\u201d; such testimony was \u201ctantamount to an endorsement of the credibility of the complaining child witness\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-8\">In this case, the defendant does not allege that Dr. Brant did not testify to child victims\u2019 general characteristics.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Instead the defendant asserts that the Commonwealth and Dr. Brant \u201ccherry-pick[ed]\u201d characteristics that were similar to those that the complainant experienced, leaving out other characteristics: that is, that they \u201ctailored] \u201d the characteristics mentioned to fit the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>evidence in this case. This type of testimony can be problematic, because \u201copinion testimony that does not explicitly link the opinion to the child witness [may] nevertheless constitute[] impermissible vouching.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>423 Mass, at 186, and cases cited. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LaCaprucia, </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. at 498.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">Dr. Brant\u2019s testimony also went beyond the description of general characteristics of child abuse victims and expanded into profile testimony relating to \u201cintrafamily sexual abuse\u201d that mirrored the complainant\u2019s family makeup and dynamic.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Poitras, </em>55 Mass. App. Ct. 691, 693-694 (2002) (expert\u2019s testimony virtually mirrored evidence proffered by prosecution; \u201c[t]he admission of such testimony that effectively provides a profile of typical abusers or abuse situations has been condemned by the appellate courts of this Commonwealth as error, especially where the particular characteristics the expert testified to could be taken by the jury to identify the defendant as fitting the profile and therefore more likely than not to have committed the crime\u201d). Dr. Brant\u2019s testimony then moved to the general characteristics of disclosure, using factors that resembled the complainant\u2019s testimony.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> This testimony essentially signaled to the jury that the complainant\u2019s testimony was credible. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LaCaprucia, </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. at 499 (expert essentially gave profile testimony that presented defendant\u2019s family situation as prone to abuse, suggesting to jury that this profile evidence was reliable factor in determining whether abuse had occurred). We have previously held that testimony such as this, \u201cwhile not directly vouching <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>for the complainant[\u2019s] credibility nor expressly connecting the childfs] claim of sexual abuse to the defendant, served as the functional equivalent.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LaCaprucia, supra </em>at 501, citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Trowbridge, </em>419 Mass, at 759-760.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">Trial counsel, who appropriately objected to Dr. Brant\u2019s testimony, suggested to appellate counsel that he raise a violation of the <em>Federico </em>standard on appeal. Appellate counsel, in his affidavit, averred that he did not pursue this issue because he \u201cdid not believe it would be successful.\u201d This decision by appellate counsel was manifestly unreasonable. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LaCaprucia, </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. at 497-502; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Poitras, </em>55 Mass. App. Ct. at 694-695. See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Day, </em>409 Mass, at 723 (such testimony \u201cinherently prejudicial to the defendant\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">Appellate counsel\u2019s behavior deprived the defendant of an available, substantial ground of defense by \u201cfail[ing] to raise a significant and obvious issue . . . which . . . may have resulted in a reversal of the conviction, or an order for a new trial.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sowell, </em>34 Mass. App. Ct. at 232, quoting from <em>Gray </em>v. <em>Greer, </em>800 F.2d at 646. If the issue had been argued on appeal and Dr. Brant\u2019s testimony had been held inadmissible, the question would then have been whether there was reversible error.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Given the lack of physical evidence, the issue of guilt here ultimately turned on credibility.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> See and compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Poitras, </em>55 Mass. App. Ct. at 694-695 (\u201cThe harm is particularly pronounced when ... the issue of guilt ultimately turn[s] on . . . credibility . . . and the prosecutor, in closing argument, remindfs] the jury of the very testimony by the expert that provided profile characteristics matching those of the defendant\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>Also, \u201c[p]art of th[e] determination turns on what the prosecutor argued to the jury.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LaCaprucia, </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. at 501. Here, during closing argument, the prosecutor suggested the complainant\u2019s family dynamic fit a characteristic that Dr. Brant had opined was indicative of child sex abuse. In addition, the prosecutor specifically referenced Dr. Brant\u2019s testimony when she urged the jury to consider the relationship between the defendant and the complainant.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Furthermore, the judge merely gave the standard instructions regarding expert testimony and credibility. Without specific instructions, it is more likely than not that the jury considered Dr. Brant\u2019s testimony \u201cas supportive of the accuracy, reliability, and truthfulness\u201d of the complainant\u2019s testimony. <em>Id. </em>at 502. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rather, </em>37 Mass. App. Ct. 140, 150-151 (1994). As a sufficient basis appears on this record to constitute reversible error, we conclude that appellate counsel\u2019s failure to argue this issue satisfies both prongs of the <em>Saferian </em>test, and that \u201cbetter work might have accomplished something material for the defense.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Satterfield, </em>373 Mass, at 115.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">We acknowledge that the strategy of \u201c \u2018[wjinnowing out weaker arguments on appeal and focusing on\u2019 those more likely to prevail ... is the hallmark of effective appellate advocacy.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sowell, </em>34 Mass. App. Ct. at 233, quoting from <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Murray, 477 </em>U.S. 527, 536 (1986). Here, however, appellate counsel, instead of arguing that it was error to admit Dr. Brant\u2019s testimony, chose to challenge the jury selection process and the admission of fresh complaint evidence.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Aspen, </em>53 Mass. App. Ct. at 261-270. In short, appellate counsel did not raise the most winnable argument on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>3. <em>Other issues. </em>We do not reach the remaining arguments raised by the defendant, as they are either without merit or unlikely to result in the granting of a new trial. Deciding as we do, we do not need to discuss the defendant\u2019s right to a public trial.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\"><em>Conclusion. </em>The order denying the motion for a new trial is reversed, and a new order shall enter allowing the motion for a new trial.

However, as we have often stated, \u201cthe preferred method for raising a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is through a motion for a new trial.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zinser, </em>446 Mass. 807, 810 (2006).
