The bulk of the complaint alleged charges of inadequate record keeping and improper wage payments to employees. Most importantly, on this appeal, the complaint alleged defendant had credited or deducted tips of their employees from their minimum wage, thereby engaging in an act of unfair competition. Plaintiff and defendant filed declarations in the trial court. After a hearing, the court enjoined defendant from crediting tips against wages owed. From that order, defendant filed this appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b45-9\">Appellant contends: (1) respondent seized evidence without a warrant in violation of the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and article I, section 13, of the California Constitution; (2) the Labor Code precludes filing a complaint alleging unfair competition; (3) the Labor Code authorizes an employer to deduct tips against the minimum wage.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-10\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b45-11\">On August 7, 1978, Investigator Galindo from the State Department of Industrial Relations, Division of Labor Standards Enforcement (hereafter Division), entered the restaurant premises owned by respondent to determine compliance with Labor Code laws and to inspect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>business records.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Galindo encountered the manager, one Neal Meyers.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After Galindo identified himself, a colloquy ensued between them regarding the purpose of the visit. The parties dispute the legal effect of the conversation, to be discussed <em>infra, </em>but in any event the manager directed Galindo to contact the bookkeeper for further information in the records. The bookkeeper cooperated with Galindo and furnished him evidence of employee records. Thereafter, Galindo made a second and third trip to the restaurant and obtained additional evidence without objection. From these records information was used in support of the complaint and offered in evidence at the hearing. At no time did Galindo act pursuant to a search warrant, an inspection warrant nor judicial order.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">Appellant contends the search of the records conducted without prior judicial authority violates the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution and its state counterpart, article I, section 13, of the California Constitution. Because the search is essentially administrative in nature, a warrant is arguably required under the doctrines announced by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Camara </em>v. <em>Municipal Court </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>(1967) 387 U.S. 523 [18 L.Ed.2d 930, 87 S.Ct. 1727], and <em>See </em>v. <em>Seattle </em>(1967) 387 U.S. 541 [18 L.Ed.2d 943, 87 S.Ct. 1737, 1741]. In each of these cases, the Supreme Court held that governmental agencies must obtain a warrant to search private residences for building code violations or private portions of premises not open to the public to determine fire code violations unless such business is closely regulated. <em>(Marshall </em>v. <em>Barlow\u2019s, Inc. </em>(1978) 436 U.S. 307 [56 L.Ed.2d 305, 98 S.Ct. 1816].) While a sanitation or health inspection of a restaurant facility might dispose of the need for a warrant on an emergency theory,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> entry and search for business records would ordinarily not invoke the emergency exception. Under normal circumstances, therefore, the office of a restaurant does not differ significantly from any other privately owned business open to the public.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b47-4\">'  An exception to the warrant requirement exists if an authorized party voluntarily consents to a search without a warrant. <em>(People </em>v. <em>James </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 99 [137 Cal.Rptr. 447, 561 P.2d 1135].) Under settled constitutional principles, a party may waive the warrant requirement and consent to a search if the waiver is voluntary, authorized properly and solicited without threat, coercion or fraud. <em>(Bumper </em>v. <em>North Carolina </em>(1968) 391 U.S. 543 [20 L.Ed.2d 797, 88 S.Ct. 1788].) No question exists that the manager of the respondent lacked authority to consent. The central issues are: voluntariness of the consent and absence of threats. The burden is on the prosecution to establish each of these prerequisites. <em>(People </em>v. <em>James, supra, </em>19 Cal. 3d 99.)</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">Galindo testified he arrived at the location and identified himself. What occurred thereafter is set forth in the margin.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b48-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>While the record is not altogether clear, the tenor of the testimony supports the voluntariness of the consent. Apparently the manager <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>was extremely busy with restaurant affairs and disinclined to discuss mundane record keeping matters. This interpretation is corroborated by his direction to Galindo to contact the most obvious person to answer his questions\u2014the bookkeeper. After this directive, Galindo obtained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>the necessary information without any objection. Witnesses for appellant testified, denying they consented to the search. Moreover, testimony was offered that Galindo threatened them with criminal penalties if they refused. Galindo denied any threats in a counterdeclaration. The trial court concluded that \u201cin the matter of the search, there is, I believe, credible evidence which persuades me, at least for the purposes of this hearing, that it was a legal search.\u201d While this conclusion is not specifically a finding of fact, the court obviously elected to accept the testimony of Galindo.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\">This court is bound by the implied factual finding of consent and the evidence supports that conclusion. Although the trial court did not actually observe the witnesses in court because all testimony was offered by deposition and declaration, the factual dispute demanded resolution of the conflict. \u201c\u2018On appeal, all presumptions favor the exercise of that power, and the trial court\u2019s findings on such matters, whether express or implied, must be upheld if they are supported by substantial evidence.\u2019\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Rios </em>(1976) 16 Cal.3d 351, 357 [128 Cal.Rptr. 5, 546 P.2d 293].)</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">Appellant contends that Business and Professions Code section 17200* *****<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> 8cannot support the alleged unfair business practices recited in the complaint and that Labor Code sections 1171 through 1179<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> provide the exclusive remedy to recover unpaid minimum wages. In <em>People </em>v. <em>McKale </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 626 [159 Cal.Rptr. 811, 602 P.2d 731], the district attorney filed complaints alleging unlawful competition against the defendant for claimed violations of the Mobile Home Parks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>Act.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In reversing a judgment entered upon a demurrer sustained against the People, the court held: \u201cUnfair competition is defined to include \u2018unlawful, unfair or fraudulent business practice and unfair, deceptive, untrue or misleading advertising.\u2019 (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 17200.) California courts have consistently interpreted such language broadly. An \u2018unlawful business activity\u2019 includes \u2018\u201canything that can properly be called a business practice and that at the same time is forbidden by law.\u201d\u2019 <em>(Barquis </em>v. <em>Merchants Collection Assn. </em>(1972) 7 Cal.3d 94, 113 [101 Cal.Rptr. 745, 496 P.2d 817].) The Legislature \u2018intended ... to permit tribunals to enjoin on-going wrongful business conduct in whatever context such activity might occur.\u2019 <em>(Id. </em>at p. 111.)\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>McKale, </em>supra, 25 Cal.3d 626, 631-632.)</p>\n<p id=\"b51-4\">In responding to a similar contention asserted by appellant here, the court said: \u201cThe district attorney is expressly authorized to maintain a civil action for either injunctive relief or civil penalties for acts of unfair competition (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 17204, 17206). Business and Professions Code section 17205 also provides that remedies and penalties available in an unfair competition action are cumulative to remedies and penalties available under other state laws, unless otherwise expressly provided.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 633.)</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">The clear language of the Business and Professions Code prohibiting unfair competition authorizes filing of a complaint for unfair competition supplementary to any other provision of the law. That the Labor Code provides similar relief against unlawful labor practices cannot foreclose cumulative remedies under the Business and Professions Code if the alleged misconduct does indeed constitute an unfair business practice. (See III.)</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">Appellant contends that crediting tips against minimum wages does not violate the provision of Labor Code section 351: \u201cNo employer or agent shall [1] collect, take, or receive any gratuity or a part thereof, paid, given to or left for an employee by a patron, or [2] deduct any amount from wages due an employee on account of such gratuity, or [3] require an employee to credit the amount, or any part thereof, of such gratuity against and as a part of the wages due the employee from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>the employer. Every such gratuity is hereby declared to be the sole property of the employee or employees to whom it was paid, given, or left for\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">The identical argument was rejected by the California Supreme Court in <em>Industrial Welfare Com. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1980) 27 Cal.3d 690, 729-730 [166 Cal.Rptr. 331, 613 P.2d 579]: \u201cThe employers contend that the IWC has misinterpreted the effect of the 1975 amendment to section 351, asserting that while the Legislature intended by such amendment to prohibit the IWC from allowing employers directly to deduct from an employee\u2019s wages tips that an employee actually receives, the Legislature did not intend to prohibit the commission itself from indirectly achieving a somewhat comparable result by establishing a lower minimum wage for tipped employees. Although the tip credit practice sanctioned by the IWC in the past may have engendered particular abuse because individual employers exacted credit from their employees on an individual basis, we think that the legislative history of the 1975 bill supports the IWC\u2019s conclusion that the Legislature contemplated that the enactment would insure that tips received by an employee would not reduce an employer\u2019s minimum wage obligation, either directly or indirectly. [1f] For example, an analysis of the 1975 bill by the Senate Industrial Relations Committee specifically states: \u2018The effect of this bill would be to require employers to pay employees at least the minimum wage regardless of the amount of tips the employees receive.\u2019 Similarly, a memorandum on the legislation drafted by the Assembly Labor Relations Committee states in part: \u2018The basis for this legislation would appear to be that tips or gratuities are given for individual excellence of service above and beyond the basic duties of employment, and as such, the employer has no vested right to consider tips a part of wages.\u2019 In light of the legislative history, the. IWC could reasonably interpret the amendment of section 351 as a legislative determination that all employees should be guaranteed a minimum wage that is not reduced by virtue of any tips an employee may possibly receive. As already noted, the commission\u2019s interpretation of the statutes which it administers is entitled to great weight, and, in our view, the employers have not demonstrated a sufficient basis for rejecting the commission\u2019s interpretation of this provision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">Appellant here has cited <em>Cal. Drive-In Restaurant Assn. </em>v. <em>Clark </em>(1943) 22 Cal.2d 287 [140 P.2d 657, 147 A.L.R. 1028]. <em>McKale </em>not only cites the <em>California Drive-In </em>decision as supportive of its decision but adopts its rationale.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>Improperly crediting tips against a minimum wage skews employee benefits such as vacation or sick time; inaccurately reflects income for federal and state income tax purposes; avoids payment of additional wages for overtime and split shifts. That the employees of appellant received better than average tips, according to appellant, which are partially reported, does not alter the above factors. Such a practice clearly violates California law and constitutes an unfair business practice within the meaning of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-4\">Order affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">Lillie, Acting P. J., and Hanson (Thaxton), J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">Appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied September 10, 1981.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b45-12\"> Assigned by the Chairperson of the Judicial Council.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"APX\">Although the court issued other orders, none is relevant here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b46-6\">Pursuant to the authority of Labor Code sections 1174 and 1175: \u201cEvery person employing labor in this state shall: [H] (a) Furnish to the commission, at its request, reports or information which the commission requires to carry out this chapter.

And he could not answer any questions. He said he was very busy and that he would let me talk to the bookkeeper and she would answer any questions I had. \u201cQ What questions did you ask of him? <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>\u201cA I asked them if they had an IWC order posted, if they had a work schedule posted, if they had a pay day notice posted, if they had a workmen\u2019s compensation certificate posted naming the company and the policy number. And I think that was ail. \u201cQ When you went to the Palm that day, did you take any subpoenas with you? \u201cA No. \u201cQ Did you serve any subpoenas upon the Palm that day? \u201cA No, I did not. \u201cQ Did you ask Mr. Delmaestro or any other person in management to see any documents at the Palm that day? \u201cA Yes. \u201cQ Who did you ask? \u201cA The person that I met there that was said was the manager, the person that was in charge at the time. \u201cQ What documents did you ask to see? \u201cA I just mentioned them to you. I wanted to see if he had an IWC order posted, if he had workmen\u2019s compensation and pay day notice, payroll records. \u201cQ What was his response when you asked him for these documents? \u201cA He said he was too busy and he couldn\u2019t talk to me, that he would let me talk to the bookkeeper, or something to that effect. \u201cQ But he told you that the bookkeeper would help you? \u201cA Yes, that she would answer my questions, yes. \u201cQ And thereupon did you meet with [the bookkeeper] ? \u201cA Yes. \u201cQ Do you recall where in the restaurant you met with her? \u201cA In her office\u2014or, in the little office. I don\u2019t know if it was hers. \u201cQ But that was an office in the back of the restaurant? \u201cA Yes. \u201cQ What questions did you ask of the bookkeeper, Miss Gregory? \u201cA I\u2014as I recall, I asked to see payroll records, evidence of workmen\u2019s compensation insurance coverage, pay day notice, IWC order. And that\u2019s all I can remember at this time. \u201cQ Did you explain to her or to anybody in management any right you had to see those documents at the time of your visit? \u201cA Any right I had to see them? \u201cQ Yes. \u201cA No, I don\u2019t recall. \u201cQ Did you explain or describe how you felt you were entitled to see those documents at the time of that visit? \u201cA I think\u2014I\u2019m not positive, but it seems like I\u2014I remember this man that was the manager there didn\u2019t want to even talk to me and he said that he didn\u2019t have time and\u2014I\u2014I just don\u2019t recall, really. I don\u2019t know. \u201cQ But what you are saying, you don\u2019t have any specific recollection of explaining or identifying how you felt you were entitled to see any documents at the time of that visit, do you? \u201cA No specific recollection, no. \u201cQ To your knowledge did anyone else in the Division other than you give any advance warning to the Palm Restaurant that you would be making that investigation and that visit? \u201cA No. \u201cQ What documents did you see that day at the Palm? <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>\u201cA I remember seeing some payroll records. And 1 think that\u2019s the only ones I saw. \u201cQ Did you ask [the bookkeeper] any questions? \u201cA Yes. \u201cQ Do you recall what you asked her? \u201cA No, not specifically. \u201cQ In general. \u201cA I asked about the payroll records; how\u2014how they were figured out, what hours were being paid to certain individuals for the amount of money being shown, what company they had coverage with on workmen\u2019s compensation. Questions like that in general. \u201cQ When you first met [the manager] there he was perfectly cooperative with you, wasn\u2019t he? \u201cA Well, if we are talking about the first individual that I saw\u2014 \u201cQ Yes\u2014 \u201cA \u2014that was the manager\u2014 \u201cQ The one you identified as being an Italian? \u201cA Well, I said I believed that this person was [the manager] but apparently he isn\u2019t. Now, you know, I know that he wasn\u2019t. \u201cQ Well, whoever you met that day, you understood him to be part of management? \u201cA Yes. \u201cQ He was perfectly cooperative with you, wasn\u2019t he? \u201cA No. \u201cQ In what ways wasn\u2019t he? \u201cA Well, he didn\u2019t want to talk to me. He said that he didn\u2019t have the time, that we are\u2014had no business being there or something to that effect, and that he would let me speak with the bookkeeper and she would answer whatever questions I had, or something to that effect. \u201cQ Did he want to know who you represented? \u201cA Yes. \u201cQ Did he want to know why you were there? \u201cA I don\u2019t recall that he asked. \u201cQ Did he want to know if anything was wrong? \u201cA No, he didn\u2019t ask me if anything was wrong, as I remember, no. \u201cQ Did he ask if there was some investigation going on? \u201cA I don\u2019t recall. \u201cQ What you recall is that he was generally objecting to your being there and asking to see documents and so forth? \u201cA Yes. \u201cQ Do you recall what [the bookkeeper] told you in substance? As best you recall. \u201cA As best l recall, she just basically answered the questions that I had, gave the information that I requested. But I don\u2019t recall anything specific, no. \u201cQ When this management person you were speaking to objected to your being there and looking at the documents, did you tell him that you felt that you were entitled to get the information that you were looking for? \u201cA Yes. \u201cQ Did you give any reason for your opinion that you were entitled? \u201cA Well, I don\u2019t remember any reason- in particular, but I must have, because normally that would have been the procedure. If they would have asked me why, I would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>have told them. \u201cQ What was your normal procedure? What would you have told them? \u201cA Well, that 1 was from the Department of Labor Standards Enforcement, 1 was there to conduct a routine investigation and\u20141 don\u2019t remember exactly how the whole thing went, but something to that effect. \u201cQ That is what you recall in general? \u201cA Yes.\u201d Later on he testified: \u201cAgain, if that conversation\u2014I remember that conversation, but 1 don\u2019t know if it was the second time or the first time. But it was one of those times that the conversation took place. But he did not want to give me anything, he was busy, he didn\u2019t want me around, he wanted me to get the hell out.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b50-13\">Business and Professions Code section 17200 provides: \u201c[U]nfair competition shall mean and include unlawful, unfair or fraudulent business practice .... \u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b50-14\">Pertaining to wages, hours and working conditions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b51-8\">Under Code of Civil Procedure section 3369, now Business and Professions Code section 17200.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
