Code, \u00a7 211) and to have used a firearm in the commission thereof (Pen. Code, \u00a7 12022.5). Defendant\u2019s sole contention on appeal is that the trial court erred prejudicially in refusing to give the jury an instruction (CALJIC No. 2.91) relating the reliability of eyewitness testimony to the requirement of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. We agree that the refusal was error, but find it harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">On September 12, 1979, at about 11:30 p.m., an individual identified as defendant entered Allen\u2019s Donut Shop in Rancho Cordova, California. He wore a dark sport jacket, white or light pants, a shoulder holster, and carried a handgun. As he entered he was attempting to pull a paper bag (in which eye holes had been cut) down over his face. As he approached the counter, however, he pushed the bag back onto the top of his head after he tripped over a chair, apparently as a result of restricted vision. He ordered the two employees present, Muriel. Alex and Betty Larson, to the counter. There Alex had an opportunity to observe his face closely as she stood three feet in front of him for \u201c[h]alf a minute, a minute\u201d before he ordered her to lie on the floor. He directed Larson to give him the money from the cash register, which she did without looking at his face. She gave him between $50 and $100. Defendant then told Alex to open the safe, which she attempted to do while he held a gun at the back of Larson\u2019s head. Moments later, the ringing of the bell at the shop\u2019s entrance alerted Larson to the fact that defendant had fled.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">David Hamilton and Patricia Anderson were passing by the donut shop in a car as defendant ran out. He was wearing white pants and a brown jacket and carrying a bag, which he dropped at some point. They followed him in the car, keeping sight of him as he ran across a field and around a pizza parlor and emerged a moment later with a companion. Hamilton and Anderson generally followed the two at a discreet distance, but had occasion to drive past them several times and were able to observe defendant\u2019s face. After defendant and his companion entered a nearby apartment, they contacted the sheriffs office.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">Immediately after the robbery, just as Hamilton and Anderson began to follow defendant, two deputies arrived at the donut shop for a coffee break. One of them, Deputy Gary Lewis, saw defendant, dressed in white pants and a brownish sport coat, running across the street near the stop. When the other deputy entered the shop, Alex told him of the robbery and pointed out the paper bag which defendant had discarded in the parking lot. The deputies began to search the vicinity. A short time later they were directed to join other deputies at the apartment identified by Hamilton and Anderson.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-8\">Deputies surrounded the apartment and ordered its occupants out; 11 or 12 people emerged. Defendant and six other black males were de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>tained and placed in a lineup. Deputy Lewis recognized defendant as the person he saw running from the shop. One by one, Alex, Larson, Hamilton, and Anderson were brought to view the lineup and all but Larson positively and unequivocably identified defendant as the robber, though he had evidently changed his clothing. Larson did not positively identify anyone as she had not really seen the robber\u2019s face, but she said that the build of one of the other individuals in the lineup was like that of the robber.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">A pair of white pants belonging to defendant and a \u201cwad\u201d of currency were found on the floor in one of the bedrooms of the apartment when officers entered to make certain no one remained inside. In a subsequent seach, two handguns, two shoulder holsters and a brown sport jacket were discovered, and the two wads of money found in the apartment were discovered to consist of thirty-one $1 bills and eight $5 bills.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Defendant\u2019s thumb prints were subsequently found on the paper bag left at the scene of the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">The defense was alibi. Defendant and a friend, Joseph Sisco, testified that they spent the evening at the Mather Field Non-Commissioned Officers Club. They testified that defendant had indeed been wearing his white pants earlier in the day, but he had borrowed some \u201cmore dressy\u201d gray pants to go to the club before 8 p.m. that evening. Linda Sisco, defendant\u2019s \u201cvery close lady friend,\u201d also recalled that he had changed his clothes before leaving the apartment early in the evening. Larry Wright, a neighborhood acquaintance, testified that defendant was wearing the same clothes at the lineup as when he arrived at the apartment shortly before, but on cross-examination Wright stated that defendant was wearing white pants. Joseph Sisco said the revolver and holsters found in the apartment belonged to him; the other gun, a .25 caliber automatic, belonged to a guest. Defendant explained the presence of his fingerprints on the shopping bag mask found at the scene of the robbery by noting that he sometimes bought groceries for the Sisco family.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">Defendant contends that it was error to refuse his request that CALJIC No. 2.91<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> be given to the jury.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The People implicitly concede this.  A criminal defendant is entitled upon request to an instruction that directs the jury\u2019s attention to consideration of whether reasonable doubt is engendered by specific evidence, including identification testimony. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hall </em>(1980) 28 Cal. 3d 143, 159 [167 Cal.Rptr. 844, 616 P.2d 826]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Pierce </em>(1979) 24 Cal.3d 199, 211 [155 Cal.Rptr. 657, 595 P.2d 91]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Granados </em>(1957) 49 Cal.2d 490, 496 [319 P.2d 346]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Roberts </em>(1967) 256 Cal. App.2d 488, 492-493 [64 Cal.Rptr. 70]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Guzman </em>(1975) 47 Cal.App.3d 380, 387 [121 Cal.Rptr. 69].)  The People admit that \u201c[t]he requirement is most obviously met by giving CALJIC 2.91....\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n                   They insist, however, that the error was harmless. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">The trial court gave several instructions which we think sufficiently alerted the jury to consider the relationship between the identification testimony and reasonable doubt. These were CALJIC Nos. 2.20<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (relat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>ing to the general credibility of witnesses), 2.90* *****<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (the presumption of innocence and reasonable doubt) and 4.50<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> (alibi), as well as a specific instruction on evaluating eyewitness testimony taken from <em>People </em>v. <em>Guzman, supra, </em>47 Cal.App.3d 380.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\">The giving of CALJIC No. 4.50 based on defendant\u2019s reliance upon an alibi defense is especially significant, since that instruction in essence puts to the jury the issue of identity stated in terms of the defendant\u2019s <em>presence. </em>Thus, in <em>People </em>v. <em>Gomez </em>(1972) 24 Cal.App.3d 486, 490 [100 Cal.Rptr. 896], a case the court described as \u201cclose\u201d in light of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>fact that the identification testimony was \u201cwithout any substantial corroboration,\u201d the failure to give CALJIC No. 2.91 was held to be harmless because the defense was alibi and the jury was instructed in accordance with CALJIC No. 4.50. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 490; accord <em>People </em>v. <em>Guzman, supra, </em>47 Cal.App.3d at p. 388 [error would have been harmless except for occurrence of other errors]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Ware </em>(1978) 78 Cal.App.3d 822, 842-843 [144 Cal.Rptr. 354]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Guillebeau </em>(1980) 107 Cal.App.3d 531, 545 [166 Cal.Rptr. 45].) We find this unquestioned line of cases persuasive and precisely apposite. We note, moreover, that the <em>Guzman </em>instruction on the reliability of eyewitness testimony immediately preceded the giving of CALJIC No. 2.90, the instruction on reasonable doubt. We cannot say in this case that the giving of CALJIC No. 2.91 \u201cwould have added anything material to the jury\u2019s understanding of its duty.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Gomez, supra, </em>24 Cal. App.3d at p. 490.)</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">Even apart from the foregoing, it is difficult for us to imagine how the instructional error could have prejudiced him. Despite his attempt to so characterize it, this was not at all a \u201cclose case.\u201d In <em>People </em>v. <em>Roberts, supra, </em>256 Cal.App.2d 488, cited by defendant, the reliability of the eyewitness identifications was questionable (defendant was seen through a peephole in a public restroom under \u201cfair\u201d lighting conditions) and entirely uncorroborated. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 491.) Here, in contrast, four witnesses unqualifiedly identified defendant from a lineup within about a half-hour after the robbery. One of them, Muriel Alex, had been able to observe his face from three feet away for up to a minute inside the donut shop. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Guillebeau, supra, </em>107 Cal.App. 3d at pp. 545-546.) There was also abundant corroborative evidence presented. The presence of the handguns and holsters, the \u201cwads\u201d of small bills and the brown jacket (which defendant demonstrated did not fit him well) and white pants (which defendant admitted were his) in the apartment, combined with the discovery of defendant\u2019s fingerprints on the paper bag left at the scene of the robbery, all point accusingly at defendant. <em>At the very least </em>they indicate that <em>someone </em>in the lineup observed by all the witnesses was the robber. Four of the five had no difficulty at all pointing out who it was and the fifth simply could not identify anyone.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">Carr, J., concurred.</p>\n<author id=\"b586-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>PARAS, Acting P. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AMN\">In the result and in the majority\u2019s reasoning which reaches that result, I concur. I write separately only to criticize the unnecessary and in my view mischievous rule of law which generated<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> this appeal in the first place. The Supreme Court decrees and we dutifully obey. <em>(Auto Equity Sales, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1962) 57 Cal.2d 450, 455 [20 Cal.Rptr. 321, 369 P.2d 937].) But as stated by our finest and most quotable authority, we are \u201cbound but not gagged.\u201d (6 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (2d ed. 1971) Appeal, \u00a7 665, p. 4579.)</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">My quarrel is with the now well established rule which requires a judge in a criminal trial to give \u201can instruction that directs the jury\u2019s attention to consideration of whether reasonable doubt is engendered by specific evidence, including identification testimony.\u201d (Majority opn., p. 835.)</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">What is it about our criminals and their crimes that so enchants and preoccupies the members of this state\u2019s highest tribunal that they feel compelled to formulate and propound procedural rules making it ever more difficult either to convict at all or to convict of the crimes actually committed rather than of lesser crimes? How did we go from a clear and unambiguous 1927 statement of the Legislature that after defining presumption of innocence and reasonable doubt nothing more need be told a jury on the subject, to a rule <em>mandating </em>the trial judge to comment favorably (in effect) on each item of evidence the defendant selects?</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">Penal Code section 1096a provides and has provided since 1927 that: \u201cIn charging a jury, the court may read to the jury section 1096 [presumption of innocence and definition of reasonable doubt] of this Code, <em>and no further instruction on the subject of the presumption of innocence or defining reasonable doubt need be given.\u201d </em>(Italics added.) There is nothing unclear about this direction. It unequivocally enunciates the total entitlement of a defendant on the point, without however negating the trial court\u2019s power in a proper case to amplify as needed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>This is consistent with the civil law which insists upon an absence of repetition (4 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (2d ed. 1971) Trial, \u00a7 209, p. 3027), argumentation <em>(id., </em>\u00a7 211, p. 3028), or formulization <em>(id., </em>\u00a7 212, p. 3029). The object of course is judicial neutrality, leaving the jury both uninfluenced by the court and unconfused by needless verbiage.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">The first word from our Supreme Court regarding section 1096a after 1927 came in <em>People </em>v. <em>Kane </em>(1946) 27 Cal.2d 693 [166 P.2d 285], a four-to-three decision in which the majority ignored the section and reversed a robbery conviction for failure to instruct on the relationship of specific evidence to reasonable doubt. To the claim that the issue was fully covered by the section 1096 instruction, the majority resurrected <em>People </em>v. <em>Cook </em>(1905) 148 Cal. 334 [83 P. 43], an ancient and wholly inappropriate authority both as pointed out by the <em>Kane </em>dissent (27 Cal.2d at pp. 703-704) and as revealed by a careful reading and study of its (Cook\u2019s) facts and procedural setting. Our Supreme Court next spoke on the matter in <em>People </em>v. <em>Granados </em>(1957) 49 Cal.2d 490 [319 P.2d 346], again by four to three. This time, in a complete non sequitur (although the proposed instruction there as an abstract proposition was in my opinion a proper one and not of the type I here condemn) the majority said: \u201cSection 1096a of the Penal Code declares that when the statutory definition of reasonable doubt is given (see Pen. Code, \u00a7 1096), no other instruction need be given defining reasonable doubt. <em>Despite this section, </em>a defendant, upon proper request therefor, has a right to an instruction that directs attention to evidence from a consideration of which a reasonable doubt of his guilt could be engendered. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Kane, </em>27 Cal.2d 693, 699 [3] et seq. [166 P.2d 285]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>100 Cal.App. 428, 431 [2] [280 P. 137]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Plywood Mfrs. of Calif, </em>137 Cal.App.2d Supp. 859, 872 [291 P.2d 587].)\u201d (Fns. omitted. Italics added.) (49 Cal.2d at p. 496.) Why \u201cdespite this section?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">Since <em>People </em>v. Granados, <em>supra, </em>the rule has not been questioned (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Hall </em>(1980) 28 Cal.3d 143, 159 [167 Cal.Rptr. 844, 616 P.2d 826]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Pierce </em>(1979) 24 Cal.3d 199, 211 [155 Cal.Rptr. 657, 595 P.2d 91]), section 1096a has been forgotten, and a trial judge now sits as a tool of the defendant and importunes the jury with directions to acquit if reasonable doubt is engendered by evidence A, evidence B, C, D, etc. But where is the corollary, something like a direction that if evidence X or Y or Z convinces beyond a reasonable doubt and nothing else engenders such a doubt there should be a con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>viction? There is no corollary. There is no emphasis for the prosecution.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> While aggressive defense counsel presents every conceivable \u201cformula instruction,\u201d the People\u2019s counsel in this regard is relegated to the role of a prosecutorial eunuch. If fairness is what we want, if truth is what we seek, either both sides should receive desirable judicial emphasis or neither.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">I certainly do not disagree with proper amplification to avoid confusion in specific situations. For example I heartily endorse an absolute requirement (subject to the harmless error rule) that in every case in which self defense is plausibly raised the <em>Sanchez </em>instruction <em>(People </em>v. <em>Sanchez </em>(1947) 30 Cal.2d 560, 571-572 [184 Cal.Rptr. 673]) should be given, for it eliminates the potential confusion occasioned by burden of proof considerations. I simply cannot abide an inflexible requirement for instructions which amount to judicial polemics for one side of a case.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It is my hope that the Supreme Court will soon reconsider and reject its existing pronouncements on this subject.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b582-6\"> Larson testified that she also indicated that defendant had the proper build, but the deputy who showed her the lineup recalled only her reference to the other individual.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b582-7\">Defendant suggests that his trial counsel may have been inadequate in failing to make a motion to suppress evidence so discovered, but he concedes that in the state of the present record the proper avenue for presenting the issue is by petition for a writ of habeas corpus. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Pope </em>(1979) 23 Cal.3d 412, 416 [152 Cal.Rptr. 732, 590 P.2d 859].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b583-7\">CALJIC No. 2.91 (4th ed. 1979) states: \u201cThe burden is on the State to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is the person who committed the offense with which he is charged; You must be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt of the accuracy of the identification of defendant as the person who committed the offense before you may convict him.

Thus, while the \u201cUse Note\u201d accompanying the 1976 version recommended giving the instruction \u201cwhere the <em>only </em>evidence of identification is the testimony of eye witnesses,\u201d the current \u201cUse Note\u201d recommends its use \u201cwhere the evidence of identification <em>includes </em>the testimony of eye witnesses.\u201d Certainly the evidence adduced in the instant case <em>included </em>eyewitness identifications of defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b583-10\">As modified by the trial court, CALJIC No. 2.20 (4th ed. 1979) read: \u201cEvery person who testifies under oath is a witness.

They all do (as defense counsel idly sits by, unable because of these rules ever to perform his traditional ethical duty of counseling against meritless litigation, including criminal appeals), and always with assertedly sound reasons for reversal.
