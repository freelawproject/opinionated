However, the same is true as between the offenses described in section 2113(a) and those described in section 2113(b) relating to theft.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">The history of the act is set forth generally in <em>Jerome </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1943) 318 U.S. 101, 102-104 [87 L.Ed. 640, 642, 63 S.Ct. 483]. The 1934 enactment made unlawful only offenses described as unlawful takings by force, fear and violence (essentially the offense now described in the first paragraph of \u00a7 2113(a)). In 1937 the statute was amended to include larcenous conduct and burglary, all within paragraph (a). When the Bank Robbery Act (12 U.S.C. \u00a7 588b) was reenacted as section 2113 in 1948, larcenous conduct was segregated into section 2113(b), but the violent takings and unlawful entries remained joined in section 2113(a), in essentially the present form. This apparently was to distinguish between the penalties assigned to the different acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">The United States Supreme Court interpreted section 2113 as describing a single crime, bank robbery, which may be committed in various ways. It held the second paragraph of section 2113(a), is merely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>a lesser felony offense to cover situations where persons enter a bank for criminal purposes but are frustrated before commission. <em>(Prince </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1957) 352 U.S. 322 [1 L.Ed.2d 370, 77 S.Ct. 403, 59 A.L.R.2d 940].)</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">A review of the federal cases reveals that there is a decided lack of uniformity in the charging nomenclature of offenses involving larcenous takings under section 2113(b) and unlawful entries as described in section 2113(a) paragraph two. For instance, the larceny described in section 2113(b) has been charged as bank robbery <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Golay </em>(8th Cir. 1977) 560 F.2d 866), and the burglary type offenses in paragraph two section 2113(a), referred to as attempted bank robbery <em>(Rumfelt </em>v. <em>United States </em>(7th Cir. 1971) 445 F.2d 134), entering with intent to commit a felony <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Harrison </em>(D.C. Cir. 1975) 522 F.2d 693), and entry with intent to commit larceny <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Phillips </em>(8th Cir. 1979) 609 F.2d 1271). Therefore, it is obvious a mere reference to the fact a person stands convicted of a federal offense of \u201cbank robbery\u201d under section 2113(a) does not sufficiently identify whether the act committed was one which would be a felony under the laws of California as required by Penal Code section 667.5, subdivision (f), for enhancement purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">We note also the cases clearly go in different directions as to whether the felonious forceable taking described in the first paragraph of section 2113(a) requires a specific intent to permanently deprive the victim, which would make it equivalent to the felony described in California\u2019s robbery statute, Penal Code section 211. In our view, the weight and most cogent authority is that no such specific intent is required. <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Klare </em>(9th Cir. 1976) 545 F.2d 93, 94, cert, den., 431 U.S. 905 [52 L.Ed.2d 390, 97 S.Ct. 1699].)</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">It is apparent from the above discussion the mere recitation in the charging information, and at the time of taking Plies\u2019 admission, does not enlighten us on the issue of whether the act underlying Plies\u2019 federal bank robbery conviction was, in fact, a felony equivalent to one punishable as such by the laws of California. This issue could have been raised in the trial court by Plies merely requiring the prosecution to proceed with its proof. In an obvious effort to avoid the prosecution being allowed to do this during its case in chief on the new charges, he opted to admit his priors outside the presence of the jury. By so doing, he obtained the benefit he desired, the jury was not apprised of his previous life of crime. In the same manner he prevented the prosecution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>from filling this legal gap and avoiding the expense and time consumption entailed in this single issue appeal. Plies again stood silently by at sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">Although at trial Plies obviously believed his federal bank robbery conviction fell within the enhancing provisions of Penal Code section 667.5, he was not in any manner forced to make this admission in order to avoid having the matter prejudicially brought to the attention of the jury. He could have appropriately asked to have the validity of priors bifurcated and determined either by the court, a different jury in a separate proceeding, or presented to the same jury following their returning a guilty verdict on the current charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">On this record the prosecution claims Plies waived his right to raise this matter on appeal by his conduct. This contention fails because even a counseled plea of guilty does not waive a claim the charge (allegation) is not one which the state may constitutionally prosecute <em>(Menna </em>v. <em>New York </em>(1975) 423 U.S. 61, 62-63 [46 L.Ed.2d 195, 197-198, 96 S.Ct. 241]), although in most cases factual guilt is a sufficient basis for the state\u2019s imposition of punishment. Therefore, if the information fails to charge an offense, a guilty plea does not serve to waive this defect, which could have been raised by demurrer, or otherwise, and a defendant may raise this issue for the first time on appeal. <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Meacham </em>(5th Cir. 1980) 626 F.2d 503, 510.)</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">The record is ambiguous as to whether the charging information here, and admission taken, is of a previous conviction over which the court has jurisdiction to enhance, or is not. The fact the charging document and admission state that said conviction was within the meaning of Penal Code section 667.5, subdivision (b), is of little assistance. Since it is clear the offense described in section 2113(a), most nearly related to the term \u201cbank robbery,\u201d does not fall therein, and the majority of the cases we have found referring to pleadings describing the offense in the second paragraph charge under a label other than robbery, the fact the crime is charged as \u201cbank robbery\u201d strongly suggests the federal conviction falls within the first paragraph of section 2113(a), for which the court lacks jurisdiction to enhance.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">Rather than striking the enhancement, we follow the procedure suggested in <em>People </em>v. <em>Roberson </em>(1978) 81 Cal.App.3d 890 [146 Cal.Rptr. 777], and remand for resentencing. Unless the People can show at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>resentencing hearing there was a prior felony as defined in Penal Code section 667.5, subdivision (f), the prior must be stricken.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">Cologne, Acting P.
