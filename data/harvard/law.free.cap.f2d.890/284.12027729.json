Upon his reentry, Customs agents discovered three pounds of marijuana concealed in his belongings. The state of Florida prosecuted Chong in its courts. Pursuant to Florida Statute 948.01(3), the state court withheld adjudication of guilt and imposition of sentence, but placed Chong on probation for six months.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-26\">The issue is: whether the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) correctly held that Chong had been \u201cconvicted\u201d within the meaning of the immigration laws of the United States. Conviction of a felony is a ground for deportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-27\">The BIA properly held that the petitioner was \u201cconvicted\u201d within the meaning of section 241(a)(ll) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251(a)(ll), although the state court or<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>dered that the adjudication of the petitioner\u2019s guilt be withheld. The petitioner clearly meets the standards set forth by the BIA in <em>Matter of Ozkok, </em>Interim Decision 3044 (BIA 1988), and thus has been \u201cconvicted\u201d for immigration purposes. The BIA was also correct in not considering the Florida expungement statute because this court, other courts of appeals, and the BIA have expressly held that the term \u201cconvicted\u201d in the Act must be interpreted in accordance with federal standards. <em>Gonzalez de Lara v.
