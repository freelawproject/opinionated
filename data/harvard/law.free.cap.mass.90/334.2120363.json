At the trial in the superior court, before <em>Allen, </em>C. J., the plaintiff relied solely upon misrepresentations by the defendant as to the price paid by her for the land which she conveyed by way of exchange to the plaintiff; and the chief justice ruled that, upon this state of facts, the action could not be maintained, and directed a verdict for the defendant, which was accordingly rendered. The plaintiff alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b344-7\"><em>E. M.

A purchaser ought not to rely upon them ; for it is settled that, even when they are false and uttered with a view to deceive, they furnish no ground of action. <em>Medbury </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>6 Met. 246, and cases there cited. <em>Exceptions overruled.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
