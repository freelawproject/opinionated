Wright. And the said Samuel Pinch on his part agrees, in consideration of the foregoing agreements, to remain and continue in the employ of the parties of the first part so long as they shall require his services, but not exceeding one year from the date hereof, for the same salary and compensation that has been heretofore paid to him, to wit, $100 per month, and the house and lands now occupied by him rent free; and if his services shall not be required for the full term of. one year, he hereby agrees to leave the employ of the parties of the first part, and surrender the possession of the house and lands to them at any time, after receiving one month\u2019s notice from them.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b547-5\">The bill further alleged that the plaintiff entered the service <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>of said Anthony and those for whom he acted, and continued therein so long as his services were required, and until the filing of this bill, although since 1854 the defendants have abandoned mining operations in said lands; and that he is entitled to maintain'a charge and lien upon said lands for the sum of \u00a1$6500, and interest from the date of the agreement, and to have the lands sold, and the proceeds applied in payment of his claim.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b548-5\">The plaintiff afterwards filed a supplemental bill, alleging that on the 26th of February 1863 the said Anthony, with a view to the formation of a joint stock company, conveyed the premises to Stephen Hill, Jr., who shortly thereafter conveyed the same to the \u201c Manhan Silver Lead Mining Company,\u201d which the plaintiff believes to be a joint stock company; that since the conveyance to Hill, the plaintiff, at Hill\u2019s request, has devoted his attention to the development of said mines, and Hill has frequently assured the plaintiff that there should be a speedy and satisfactory settlement of his claim, but that such settlement has never been made. The plaintiff therefore prayed that said Hill and Manhan Silver Lead Mining Company might be made defendants, and that he might have such relief as he might be entitled to in equity.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b548-6\">The defendants filed a general demurrer, and the case was thereupon reserved for the determination of the whole court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b548-7\"><em>G.

The language of the agreement does not import the giving of a lien upon the real estate, or its proceeds. No interest in the premises was conveyed. It was merely an executory agreement, designating the fund out of which the plaintiff should be paid. <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>Hosack, </em>18 Wend. 119. <em>Brainard </em>v. <em>Burton, </em>5 Verm. 97. <em>Bonsey </em>v. <em>Amee, </em>8 Pick. 236. <em>Webb </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>7 Cush. 50. <em>Clarke </em>v. <em>Sibley, </em>13 Met. 211. <em>Hunt </em>v. <em>Rousmanier, </em>8 Wheat 174.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"ATx\">The bill sets out a case which clearly entitles the plaintiff to equitable relief. The rule is perfectly well settled, that a party may by express agreement create a charge or claim in the nature of a lien on real as well as personal estate of which he is the owner or possessor, and that equity will establish and enforce such charge or claim, not only against the party who stipulated to give it, but also against third persons, who are either volunteers or who take the estate on which the lien is agreed to be given, with notice of the stipulation. Such an agreement raises a trust which binds the estate to which il relates ; and all who take title thereto, with notice of such trust can be compelled in equity to fulfil it. <em>Legard </em>v. <em>Hodges, </em>1 Ves. Jr. 477. <em>Roundell </em>v. <em>Breary, 2 </em>Vern. 482. <em>Power </em>v <em>Bailey, </em>1 Ball &amp; Beat. 49. <em>Gardner </em>v. <em>Townsend, </em>Coop. Eq Cas. 303. <em>Wellesley </em>v. <em>Wellesley, </em>4 Myl. &amp; Cr. 561. It is ob. vious that the law gives no remedy by which such a lien can bo established, and the trust thereby created be declared and enforced. Equity furnishes the only means by which the property-on which the charge is fastened can be reached and applied ti the stipulated purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">On looking at the agreement set out in the bill, there is no room for doubt as to the intent of the parties to give to the plaintiff a claim on the lands therein described, as security for the money which they stipulated to pay to him. The agreement is not only that he shall have an interest in the proceeds of the sale of said lands, if the same should be sold, of a certain amount of stock in a joint stock company, if one should be formed, for the amount which they agreed to pay, but it is expressly stipulated that the amount due to him, \u201c whether of cash or stock, is to be a charge on the joint estate of the parties, in proportion to their respective interests,\u201d to the extent of five thousand dollars, and the residue of the sum, being fifteen hundred dollars, \u201c is to be a charge on the separate estate \u201d of one of the parties. It is difficult to see bow an intent to create a lien on the lands named could be more clearly expressed. The precise form in which the plaintiff may be entitled to relief cannot be determined, until the case is heard on its merits. The only order which we can now properly make is. <em>Demurrer overruled.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
