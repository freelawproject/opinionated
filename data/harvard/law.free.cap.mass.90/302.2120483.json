He made sales of the coal, wood and bark; and rendered to them monthly accounts of these sales, including sales made on credit as well as sales made for cash.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b315-7\">\u201c Hammond, in books kept in his own name, entered all sales of coal, wood and bark, and charged to the purchasers those which were made on credit. He accepted the drafts of the plaintiffs, or gave them his notes, amounting in the aggregate to the cost of the coal at wholesale prices ; taking their receipt for each draft or note, in which they promised to account for the same at maturity. Whenever he paid a note or draft, the amount thereof was put to his credit in the monthly account which he rendered. The notes and drafts which he did not pay, amounting in all to $15,982.54, the plaintiffs produced and offered to surrender. At their request, they are filed with this report.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b315-8\">\u201c When Hammond applied for the benefit of the insolvent act, there was due from him to the plaintiffs, for sales of coal, wood and bark under the contract, the sum of $6732.90. The coal which remained on hand was appraised at $9052, and was taken from the assignees on a writ of replevin.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b315-9\"><em>\u201c </em>Betteley and Sawyer, at the time of their appointment as assignees, were aware that the plaintiffs claimed the book debts and coal as their property. On the 26th day of July 1861, the plaintiffs demanded of the assignees the books aforesaid, or an opportunity to examine and take copies of them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b315-10\">\u201c The assignees have collected of these debts $4606.03. And <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>they now have gas stock to the amount of $100.51, and two due-bills, amounting together to $90.99, taken in settlement, of some of the debts. Many of the debts are not yet collected. Of the money collected, a part, viz., $547.03, was received by the assignees before the 26th day of July aforesaid. The assignees placed some of the demands in the hands of an attorney for collection. He made collections to the amount of $696.28, and charged for his services $350. These charges the assignees, in good faith, allowed and paid. The assignees claim to have allowed to them the money so expended, and compensation for their trouble in making other collections. I find that a commission of eight per cent, on the entire amount collected would be a reasonable compensation for making the collections, if the court should be of opinion that, upon the facts, they are entitled to any. There was no evidence offered of any subsequent paroi agreement.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b316-5\">The parties also agreed that monthly accounts were rendered by Hammond to the plaintiffs, on one side of which was placed in one sum the net amount of the sales of the preceding month, and on the other the payments made by him during that month, for freight, insurance, purchase of wood and bark, and of such kinds of coal as were not furnished by the plaintiffs, including such notes or drafts as had been paid by him. The balance of each account thus made up was carried forward into the next account. No interest account was ever made up or stated upon the items in these accounts, and no settlement was ever made or attempted to be made upon them. Copies of these accounts were annexed, by which it appeared that, by the account for December 1860, the balance against Hammond, as there stated, was $83.71.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b316-6\">The case was reserved by the chief justice for the determination of the whole court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b316-7\"><em>S.

The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>defendants are not liable at all for moneys collected by them. Taking the whole contract together, it was the intention to permit Hammond to sell coal, &amp;c., and account for it at a certain price fixed by the plaintiffs, for which price he would be responsible as cash. It was not a sale upon commission, as ordinarily understood and practised. The whole business was done in the name of Hammond; he could sell in his own name, on credit or for cash, and was to give notes or acceptances for the amount agreed upon, which operated as a settlement. 2. In any event, the assignees should be allowed their commissions and expenses in making the collections.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b317-5\">Hoar, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AXk\">When this cause was before us at an earlier stage, we supposed the legal effect of the contract between the plaintiffs and Hammond not to be in dispute. 5 Allen, 382. But, if it were open for discussion, it is very plain that under it the whole of the coal, wood and bark on the wharves and yards of Hammond was the property of the plaintiffs, and that Hammond was to carry on the business as their agent or factor. Such is the whole scope of the contract, and there are several specific provisions which it is impossible to reconcile with any other construction. Thus the plaintiffs agree to stock the wharves and yards with a full supply of coal, wood and bark, and to pay Hammond a fixed sum per ton \u201c for doing the business.\u201d Hammond agrees not to sell or deal in any other coal, wood or bark than that furnished by the plaintiffs, \u201c or purchased on their account, with their consent in writing; \u201d and to <em>\u201c </em>guarantee the payment of all coal sold by them [Hammond &amp; Co.] at retail for ninety cents per ton, which shall cover all expenses and charges.\u201d All the coal, wood, &amp;c., on hand at the time the contract took effect was to be estimated and appraised, and \u201c taken \u201d by the plaintiffs \u201c at the market price.\u201d But most decisive of all is the agreement that the plaintiffs \u201c reserve the right to fix the price of coal from time to time, both at retail and wholesale, provided the pnce so fixed shall not be above the lowest market price selling at the time.\u201d They may require it to be sold at as low a rate as they choose, which would be a strange stipulation in respect to the property of another.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>The agency of Hammond was terminated by his insolvency, and the property remaining, and the proceeds of such parts of it as had been sold, were the property of the plaintiffs, and subject to their disposal, unless their agent had some lien upon it which would pass to the assignees. <em>Scott </em>v. Surman, Willes, 400. The defendants, as assignees in insolvency, assumed no personal obligation in respect to the execution of the contract ; and its provisions had been violated by Hammond, so that the plaintiffs were entitled to reclaim the property itself for their security. The fact that by the contract Hammond was to guarantee the sales gave the defendants no title to the proceeds of the property sold, unless where the amount due upon any specific sale had been accounted for to the plaintiffs, and the amount due upon it paid over to them. It appears that a great many sales have been entered upon the accounts rendered from month to month before the insolvency. But no interest account has been computed or adjusted; the balance appearing due has been regularly carried forward in account from one month to another; and we can see no evidence of any intent of the parties to treat the debts as transferred to the agent. There was, in fact, only a statement, and not a settlement of accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">The <em>only </em>other point requiring notice is the payment by the defendants, of the expenses of collecting some of the debts. These payments having been made, and the collections having been made, after full notice that the plaintiffs claimed the books and accounts as their property, although made in good faith, were made in violation of the plaintiffs\u2019 rights. The defendants have therefore no claim for compensation or commissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">\n<em>Decree for the plaintiffs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
