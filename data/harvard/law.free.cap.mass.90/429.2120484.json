Among this property was a cow, which was sold for \u00a721.50. The plaintiffs were allowed to prove, against the defendant\u2019s objection, that the defendant had brought a suit and recovered judgment against the officer for the taking of the cow; and the judge ruled that the plaintiff was entitled to recover the sum of \u00a7159.68, with interest, and a verdict was returned accordingly. The defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b439-8\"><em>I. </em>Sumner, for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AtqP\">cited <em>Wyer </em>v.

It appears from the case of <em>Langdon </em>v. <em>Langdon, </em>1 Root, 453, that by the law of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>Connecticut, where the judgment in suit was rendered, the plaintiffs might have a writ of <em>scire facias </em>thereon, and a new execution for said sum. See also <em>Stoyel </em>v. <em>Cady, </em>4 Day, 222, and <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Cable, </em>7 Conn. 119. So by our Gen. Sts. <em>c. </em>133, \u00a7 18, \u201c if an execution is returned satisfied in whole or in part by the sale of property not liable to such execution, and if damages are recovered against the judgment creditor, or the officer who served the execution, on account of the seizure and sale of the property, the creditor may have a writ of <em>scire facias </em>on his judgment, and shall thereupon be entitled to a new execution for the sum then remaining justly and equitably due to him.\u201d As the creditor, in such case, had no remedy at common law, <em>scire facias </em>is his only remedy. <em>Perry </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>2 Gray, 326. <em>Andover &amp; Medford Turnpike </em>v. <em>Gould, </em>6 Mass. 44. But it is manifest that this remedy must be confined to our domestic judgments, and cannot be applied to the present case; for we cannot issue an execution on a judgment of a court of another state or country.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">For these reasons, and because legal remedies must be conformed to the law of the forum where they are sought, and, when that law affords no remedy, that forum is powerless, the plaintiffs cannot have judgment for the full amount of their verdict, and these exceptions must be sustained, unless the plaintiffs shall remit $21.50 and the interest thereon, which are included in the verdict. On remitting that amount, they may take judgment for $138.18, and interest on that \u2018 sum to the time when the verdict was returned. If the plaintiffs so elect, they may discontinue this suit, or become nonsuit, and resort to a court in Connecticut for the recovery of both tl e aforesaid sums.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
