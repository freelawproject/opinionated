CARRICO.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Adam Afzall, an infant then nine years of age, was severely injured by the negligence of a third party. The Department of Medical Assistance Services (DMAS), the Commonwealth's provider of benefits under the national Medicaid program, paid $419,809.56 for a portion of the costs of Adam's treatment related to those injuries. Adam, by his parents and next friends, Sophia and Stephen Afzall, brought an action against the third\n   party alleging the third party's negligence caused Adam's injuries. The parties settled the case, which was approved by the trial court on September 3, 2004.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   By letter dated December 3, 2004, the Commonwealth claimed a lien for the amount DMAS paid for Adam's care. Adam's counsel computed the \"Commonwealth's share\" of Adam's expenses for legal fees and costs at $142,017.62 in obtaining the settlement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Counsel submitted a check to the Office of the Attorney General for $277,791.94, representing the amount DMAS paid less the proportionate amount of Adam's legal fees and costs, \"in full satisfaction of [the] lien.\" The Office of the Attorney General returned the check with a demand for payment of the full lien in the amount of $419,809.56.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Adam, by his parents and next friends, then filed a motion for declaratory judgment against the Commonwealth, seeking a declaration that the \"Commonwealth's share\" of his expenses for legal fees and costs in obtaining settlement of his negligence case should be deducted from the amount of the lien.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In support of his position, Adam cited a provision in the second paragraph of Code \u00a7 8.01-66.9, which, after establishing liens for payments made by DMAS and other institutions for persons who sustain personal injuries, provides as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Commonwealth's or such Department's or institution's lien shall be inferior to any lien for payment of reasonable attorney's fees and costs, but shall be superior to all other liens created by the provisions of this chapter and otherwise. Expenses for reasonable legal fees and costs shall be deducted from the total amount recovered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Adam argued in the trial court that a plain reading of Code \u00a7 8.01-66.9 dictates that a plaintiff's legal fees and costs must be deducted from DMAS's share of any recovery. The Commonwealth argued that the statute did not require any deduction. The trial court rejected Adam's argument and dismissed his motion for declaratory judgment. We awarded Adam this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Adam makes the same argument on appeal as he made in the trial court. However, for the first time, the Commonwealth interposes an argument that \"[s]overeign immunity bars a declaratory judgment against the Commonwealth or its agencies.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Commonwealth concedes that it did not raise the doctrine of sovereign immunity in the trial court or in its brief in opposition to Adam's petition for appeal, but it asserts that the failure to raise the issue at an earlier time does not constitute the Commonwealth's waiver of its sovereign immunity, citing\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth v.

He contends the only similarity between the two cases is that the plaintiffs in both filed for declaratory judgments and the Commonwealth was a party to both. Unlike the plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    VBM I,\n   </em>\n   Adam says, he does not \"attempt to challenge the rules of a governmental agency or otherwise to interfere with governmental functions.\" Nor, Adam continues, does he \"attempt to improperly influence the conduct of governmental affairs through the threat or use of vexatious litigation or for damages against the government or to restrain or compel it to act.\" What he has sought, Adam concludes, is \"a judicial interpretation not of the government's right to recover its statutory lien, but to determine what the Legislature meant when it drafted the very statute that created the lien.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   We agree with the Commonwealth that\n   <em>\n    VBM I\n   </em>\n   governs the outcome of this case and is not distinguishable. The close similarity between this case and\n   <em>\n    VBM I\n   </em>\n   is that in each case the plaintiff seeks to compel the Commonwealth to take certain actions: in\n   <em>\n    VBM I\n   </em>\n   to refrain from enforcing a rule against the use of electromyographic examinations by physical therapists and in this case to require a reduction in the amount of the Commonwealth's lien for payments made for Adam's treatment. Both would have the effect of interfering with governmental functions and, in Adam's case, the adverse effect upon \"protecting the public purse.\"\n   <em>\n    Messina,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2072510\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/228/301/#p308\">\n    228 Va. at 308\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=321%20S.E.2d%20657\">\n    321 S.E.2d at 660\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In any event, the ultimate question in this case is whether Code \u00a7 8.01-66.9, upon which Adam relies, evinces an intention on the part of the General Assembly to waive sovereign immunity so as to permit a party to seek judicial review by way of a motion for declaratory judgment of action taken pursuant to that Code section. The second paragraph of Code \u00a7 8.01-66.9 makes the Commonwealth's lien \"inferior to any lien for payment of reasonable attorney's fees and costs\" but \"superior to all other liens created by the provisions of this chapter,\" with \"[e]xpenses for reasonable legal fees and costs [deductible] from the total amount recovered.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   We find nothing in the language of this paragraph of Code \u00a7 8.01-66.9 that evinces such an intention. But, as the Commonwealth points out, another paragraph of Code \u00a7 8.01-66.9 makes it clear that when the General Assembly intends to waive sovereign immunity and provide a particular procedure for an injured person to follow in seeking judicial review, it knows how to demonstrate that intention. The final paragraph of the statute provides that \"[t]he court in which a suit by an injured person . . . has been filed against the person . . . alleged to have caused such injuries or in which such suit may properly be filed, may, upon motion or petition by the injured person, . . . after written notice is given to those holding liens\n   attaching to the recovery, reduce the amount of the liens and apportion the recovery . . . between the plaintiff, the plaintiff's attorney, and the Commonwealth or such Department or institution as the equities of the case may appear.\" Consequently, we conclude the bar of sovereign immunity applies in this case because the Commonwealth has not waived that defense in the context of a declaratory judgment action within the purview of Code \u00a7 8.01-66.9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Since sovereign immunity applies in this case, the trial court was without jurisdiction to adjudicate Adam's claim. Therefore, we will dismiss the appeal and enter final judgment in favor of the Commonwealth.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <em>\n    Dismissed and final judgment.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1.\">\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    The record shows that Adam's legal fees were based upon \"one-third of the gross recovery, the amount of which is confidential.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2.\">\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    Code \u00a7 9-6.14:16(A), part of the former Virginia Administrative Process Act, was repealed by Acts 2001 ch. 844 and is now Code \u00a7 2.2-4026, part of the present Administrative Process Act.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
