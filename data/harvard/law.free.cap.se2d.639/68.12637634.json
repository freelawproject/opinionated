Burgess (Defendant) was convicted of six counts of first-degree sexual offense of a child under the age of thirteen years and sentenced to three consecutive sentences of a minimum of 288 months and a maximum of 355 months in prison. Defendant appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Prior to trial, Defendant moved to suppress certain videotaped interviews between pediatric nurses and the victims as inadmissible hearsay. The trial court denied Defendant's motion, and found the videotaped interviews admissible as statements made to obtain medical diagnosis or treatment pursuant to N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 8C-1, Rule 803(4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   At trial, the State's evidence tended to show the following. S.V. and V.V., both minors, lived with their parents, A.V. and F.V., in Cabarrus County. In June 2002, A.V.'s sister, S.P., S.P.'s two minor children, Y.V. and A.P., and Defendant relocated to North Carolina from Tennessee. They moved in with A.V. and her family. Defendant is not the father of Y.V. and A.P., and the children referred to Defendant as \"Bird\" or \"Uncle Bird.\" For a time while the two families were living together, Defendant was the only adult not employed outside the home. In mid-September 2002, Defendant, S.P., Y.V., and A.P. rented a nearby mobile home. S.P. continued to work outside the home and Defendant remained unemployed. Defendant watched Y.V. and A.P., and during September and October 2002, A.V. and F.V. paid Defendant to babysit V.V.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   S.P. observed Y.V. placing her dolls in a suggestive position in April 2003 and made an appointment for Y.V. and A.P. at the Children's Advocacy Center at NorthEast Medical Center (the Children's Center). Defendant was later arrested and charged with eight counts of first-degree sexual offense. S.V. and V.V. were also seen at the Children's Center shortly thereafter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   At trial, the State offered the testimony of S.P. to explain the incident which led her to take Y.V. and A.P. to the Children's Center. Defendant objected to this testimony as inadmissible hearsay. After a\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   hearing outside the presence of the jury, the trial court concluded the testimony was admissible as an excited utterance under N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 8C-1, Rule 803(2). S.P. testified before the jury that while she was in the car with Y.V. one evening in late April 2003, S.P. saw Y.V. position the head of one of her dolls near the genitalia of another doll. S.P. told Y.V. not to do that because it was \"nasty[.]\" The following morning, S.P. asked Y.V. if \"anybody was touching her privates[.]\" Y.V. replied that \"Bird\" was in Y.V.'s room the night before and that he \"had touched her private and rubbed it\" and that \"he scared her.\" When questioned by A.V. later in the\n   day, Y.V. said \"Bird\" had \"rubbed her privates\" the night before while her mother was sleeping.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The State proffered the testimony of Y.V. After\n   <em>\n    voir dire,\n   </em>\n   the trial judge found Y.V., who was five years old at the time of trial, competent to testify. However, the trial court stated that it did not believe that Y.V. would be able to assist the jury with any substantive issues. The State called Y.V. to the stand in the presence of the jury to demonstrate her competency. While on the stand, Y.V. stated her age, counted to eleven, recited the alphabet, and demonstrated an ability to determine whether certain statements were the truth or lies. Defendant did not ask any questions of Y.V.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Cindy Fink (Nurse Fink), a nurse with the Children's Center, testified that she interviewed Y.V. before Y.V. was examined by the pediatrician. Nurse Fink testified that during this interview, Y.V. was informed that she was at the Children's Center for a check up with the doctor. Nurse Fink further testified that when she showed Y.V. a picture of a little girl, Y.V. indicated genitalia on the picture as her \"privates\" and told Nurse Fink that \"Bird\" had \"rubbed it.\" Y.V. also said that \"someone\" had touched her on her \"hiney.\" A videotape of Nurse Fink's interview with Y.V. was shown to the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The State also proffered the testimony of S.V., who was eight years old at the time of trial. The trial court found S.V. to be a competent witness. S.V. identified Defendant as \"Bird\" while on the witness stand, and testified that \"Bird\" touched her on her \"private ... [i]n the bathroom\" of her house. S.V. testified she did not remember seeing Defendant touch her brother, V.V., or her cousins, Y.V. and A.P. Defendant asked no questions of S.V.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Sheri Cook (Nurse Cook), a nurse with the Children's Center, testified that she interviewed S.V. before S.V. was examined by the pediatrician. In the interview, S.V. stated that she \"wanted Uncle Bird to stop bad stuff like touching privates.\" A videotape of the interview was shown to the jury. During the recorded interview with Nurse Cook, S.V. said no one ever touched her \"private parts,\" but then also said Defendant only touched Y.V.'s \"privates.\" When asked how she knew that, S.V. replied that \"[her] mind just told [her].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The State attempted to admit into evidence a second videotaped interview, recorded six days after S.V.'s initial visit to the Children's Center, as a recorded recollection, or alternatively, pursuant to the residual hearsay exception. At this second interview, a police detective was present and spoke with S.V. The trial court denied the State's request to admit the second videotape.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Detective Carlos Roger Landers (Detective Landers), an investigator with the Concord Police Department, testified that he interviewed S.V. When Detective Landers asked S.V. if Defendant had touched her, S.V. nodded her head affirmatively, and pointed to her vaginal area.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   V.V., four years old at the time of trial, was also found to be a competent witness by the trial court. V.V. testified that \"Bird\" touched him on his \"private\" in the bathroom of V.V.'s house, and V.V. identified \"Bird\" as Defendant in the courtroom. T.275-76. Defendant asked no questions of V.V.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Julie Brafford (Nurse Brafford), a nurse with the Children's Center, interviewed V.V. before V.V. was examined by the pediatrician. During the interview, V.V. told Nurse Brafford that \"Uncle Bird peed on [V.V.'s] back and butt and [that it] tickled.\" V.V. also said that \"Uncle Bird\" touched him on his \"winkie\" and his \"butt\" in the bathroom of their house. While demonstrating his knowledge of body parts, V.V. named his genitalia \"winkie\" and his buttocks \"hiney or butt.\" A videotape of the interview was played for the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Patricia Mahaney (Mahaney), a licensed clinical social worker with NorthEast Psychiatric and Psychological Institute, testified for the State as an expert in the counseling and behavior of sexually abused children. Mahaney observed S.V. at a number of counseling sessions from June 2003 through August 2003, and testified that in her opinion S.V. exhibited some characteristics of post-traumatic stress, \"the technical name for trauma related to abuse\" and S.V.'s behavior was consistent with a child who had been sexually\n   abused. Mahaney testified that she also saw V.V. during this time and that he told her that \"Uncle Bird\" had touched his \"privates, [his] winkie and [his] butt[,]\" at more than one of their sessions. Mahaney also offered her opinion that V.V.'s behavior was consistent with a child who had been sexually abused.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Dr. Carol Soucie (Dr. Soucie), a pediatrician with Piedmont Pediatric Clinic, testified for the State as an expert in general pediatrics. Dr. Soucie examined Y.V., S.V., and V.V. after each child was interviewed by a nurse. Dr. Soucie also examined A.P. who was not interviewed by a nurse because he was not yet verbal. Dr. Soucie testified that her examination of Y.V. revealed no abnormal findings, except during Y.V.'s genital exam. Dr. Soucie found bruising around Y.V.'s vaginal opening, thickened areas of Y.V.'s hymen, and small scars at two different positions on Y.V.'s anus. Dr. Soucie testified that these physical findings were consistent with sexual abuse and that in her opinion there \"was definite abuse.\" Dr. Soucie's examination of S.V. revealed that S.V.'s vaginal area had \"an area that was very thinned out and irregular as well as areas that were thickened from which we see oftentimes with repeated penetration.\" Dr. Soucie also observed scars on S.V.'s perianal area that Dr. Soucie estimated were approximately three to four months old. Dr. Soucie testified that the physical findings from her examination of S.V. were consistent with sexual abuse. As to V.V., Dr. Soucie observed a scar in V.V.'s anus and a \"persistent kind of like a divot in the perianal area\" which she attributed to repeated penetration. Dr. Soucie testified that these physical findings were \"definitely\" consistent with anal penetration and repeated sexual abuse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Defendant testified that he moved with S.P. to the home of A.V. and F.V., and that he helped to take care of the children. He denied ever being alone with S.V. and V.V. After Defendant and S.P. moved to their own home, Defendant watched Y.V. and A.P. for a short period of time before he began working with a roofing company from 5:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. In January 2003, Defendant began a new position with hours from 8:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m., which he held until he was arrested. Defendant denied ever being alone with S.V. and V.V. during the time he lived in their home. Defendant denied doing anything of an improper or sexual nature to any of the children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   At the close of all the evidence, Defendant moved to dismiss each of the charges for insufficient evidence. The trial court denied the motion as to the charges pertaining to Y.V., S.V., and V.V., but granted the motion as to the charges pertaining to A.P. At the charge conference, Defendant requested an instruction on the lesser included offense of attempted sexual offense against a child. The trial court concluded that there was no substantial evidence, either direct or circumstantial, from which a jury could infer attempted sexual offense and therefore refused to give the instruction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Defendant first argues that his Sixth Amendment confrontation rights were violated when the trial court denied his motion to suppress the videotaped interviews between the nurses at the Children's Center and Y.V., S.V., and V.V. Defendant argues the statements of the children are testimonial in nature and barred by\n   <em>\n    Crawford v. Washington,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5873383\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/36/\">\n    541 U.S. 36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5873383\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/36/\">\n    124 S.Ct. 1354\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5873383\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/36/\">\n    158 L.Ed.2d 177\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2004). Further, Defendant urges that the videotaped statements are inadmissible hearsay not properly admitted as statements made for the purpose of medical diagnosis or treatment pursuant to N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 8C-1, Rule 803(4). We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Crawford,\n   </em>\n   the United States Supreme Court held that \"[w]here testimonial evidence is at issue ... the Sixth Amendment demands what the common law required: unavailability and a prior opportunity for cross-examination.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5873383\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/36/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5873383\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/36/\">\n    at 68\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5873383\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/36/\">\n    124 S.Ct. at 1374\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5873383\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/36/\">\n    158 L.Ed.2d at 203\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Supreme Court also noted, however, that \"when the declarant appears for cross-examination at trial, the Confrontation Clause places no constraints at all on the use of his prior testimonial statements.... The Clause does not bar admission of a statement so long as the declarant is present at trial to defend or explain it.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5873383\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/36/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 59-60 n. 9,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5873383\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/36/\">\n    124 S.Ct. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1369 n. 9,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5873383\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/36/\">\n    158 L.Ed.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   197-98 n. 9. Thus, to be barred by\n   <em>\n    Crawford,\n   </em>\n   the evidence offered\n   must be testimonial, the declarant must be unavailable, and the defendant must have had no prior opportunity for cross-examination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The State first argues that Defendant failed to properly preserve this issue for our review because Defendant failed to object when the videotapes were offered into evidence. We disagree. At the time of Defendant's pre-trial motion, the General Assembly had passed N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 8C-1, Rule 103(a)(2) (2005), which states in part \"[o]nce the court makes a definitive ruling on the record admitting or excluding evidence, either at or before trial, a party need not renew an objection or offer of proof to preserve a claim of error for appeal.\" In\n   <em>\n    State v. Tutt,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8438167\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/171/518/#p524\">\n    171 N.C.App. 518\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 524,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12633348\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/615/688/#p692\">\n    615 S.E.2d 688\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 692-93 (2005), this Court held that the statute failed because \"N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 8C-1, Rule 103(a)(2) is inconsistent with N.C.R.App. P. 10(b)(1)[.]\" However, at the time Defendant moved to suppress the videotapes, Rule 103 was presumed constitutional, and in our discretion we elect to review Defendant's assignment of error.\n   <em>\n    See State v. Baublitz,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8321543\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/172/801/#p806\">\n    172 N.C.App. 801\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 806,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12633599\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/616/615/#p619\">\n    616 S.E.2d 615\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 619 (2005) (reaching the defendant's assignment of error where Rule 103 was presumed to be constitutional at the time of trial);\n   <em>\n    Tutt,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8438167\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/171/518/#p524\">\n    171 N.C.App. at 524\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12633348\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/615/688/#p692\">\n    615 S.E.2d at 693\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Nonetheless, we find Defendant's\n   <em>\n    Crawford\n   </em>\n   argument unpersuasive. In the present case, S.V., V.V., and Y.V. each took the stand at trial and were therefore available for cross-examination. Defendant did not argue before the trial court, and does not argue before this Court, that the witnesses were \"unavailable\" for cross-examination. Accordingly, there was no violation of Defendant's right to confrontation under\n   <em>\n    Crawford.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Defendant also argues that the interviews were improperly admitted pursuant to N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 8C-1, Rule 803(4). We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 8C-1, Rule 803 (2005) states\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The following are not excluded by the hearsay rule, even though the declarant is available as a witness:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   ...\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   (4) Statements for Purposes of Medical Diagnosis or Treatment.

Gen.Stat. \u00a7 8C-1, Rule 803(2), the testimony of Y.V.'s mother that Defendant was in Y.V.'s room the previous night and had touched and scared Y.V. The trial\n   court admitted the testimony as an excited utterance, finding Y.V.'s statements were made after a \"sufficiently startling experience suspending reflective thought and were a spontaneous reaction to questions asked by [S.P.] at a time temporally related to her having yelled at [Y.V.] for having positioned the dolls as she had.\" T.48.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   N.C.

N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 14-27.4(a)(1) (2005). \"`Sexual act' means cunnilingus, fellatio, analingus, or anal intercourse, but does not include vaginal intercourse.

Further, S.P. testified that Y.V. told her that Defendant had touched her \"private[,]\" rubbed it, and scared her. Dr. Soucie's examination revealed vaginal bruising and anal scars. Likewise, the charges of first-degree sexual offense of V.V. were supported by V.V.'s videotaped interview with Nurse Brafford, and his in-court testimony. V.V. told Nurse Brafford that \"Uncle Bird\" touched his \"winkie\" and his \"butt.\" V.V. also told her that \"Bird\" \"peed on his butt.\" Dr. Soucie observed that V.V. had a persistent anal scar which could have resulted from repeated penetration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The State supported its allegations of sexual offense of S.V. with her videotaped interview with Nurse Cook, and S.V.'s in-court testimony. S.V. testified that \"Bird\" touched her \"privates\" in the bathroom of her house. Further, Dr. Soucie's medical examination revealed that S.V. had scars on her perianal area. We find the statements of Y.V., S.V., and V.V., and the State's medical testimony sufficient to withstand Defendant's motion to dismiss as to each of the charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Finally, Defendant argues that the trial court erred by failing to instruct the jury on attempted sexual offense because the evidence supported such an instruction.
