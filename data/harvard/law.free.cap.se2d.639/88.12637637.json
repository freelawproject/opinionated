Hollin (\"plaintiff\") appeals from an opinion and award of the North Carolina Industrial Commission (\"the Commission\") denying her claim for benefits pursuant to the Workers' Compensation Act. Plaintiff argues that, as she was required to provide her own vehicle for transportation as part of her employment as a health care aide with the Johnston County Council on Aging (\"defendant\"), the injuries she sustained while traveling to her worksite arose out of and in the course of employment. We agree and therefore reverse the opinion and award of the Commission.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff's case came before the Commission on 27 June 2005. The evidence tended to show that plaintiff was employed by defendant as a health care aide providing assistance to patients in their homes. Plaintiff saw the same patients each week and worked regular hours from 8:00 a.m. in the morning until 4:00 p.m. in the afternoon, Monday through Friday. Plaintiff was required to use her own personal vehicle for transportation to her patients' homes, and received reimbursement for travel between patients' homes. However, as part of defendant's company policy, plaintiff was not considered to be working or \"on the clock\" while traveling from her residence to her first patient's home in the morning and from her last patient's home in the afternoon back to her residence, and she did not receive reimbursement for such travel. Plaintiff earned $6.72 per hour in addition to 31\u00a2 for each mile she traveled between job sites.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On 20 May 2003, plaintiff was traveling to the home of her first patient for the day when she was involved in a head-on collision with another vehicle. As a result of the accident, plaintiff sustained severe injuries to both legs and underwent several surgeries. Plaintiff resigned from her employment with defendant on 16 June 2003 due to the severity of her injuries and the extended period of time she would require to recover.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After considering the evidence, the Commission concluded that plaintiff's injury did not arise \"in the course of\" her employment and entered an opinion and award denying her claim to benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \"This Court's review of a decision of the Full Commission is limited to determining whether competent evidence supports the Full Commission's findings of fact, and whether the Full Commission's findings of fact support its conclusions of law.\"\n   <em>\n    Munoz v.

The Commission also found that \"[p]laintiff would see these same patients until the patient died, got sick, or no longer needed her services.\" Based on these findings, the Commission concluded that:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Because plaintiff had fixed work hours and saw the same patients each week, her situation is different from a true traveling salesman who might visit a different customer each day. Plaintiff saw the same patients week after week, traveled to the same homes week after week, and therefore she had fixed work locations.

Plaintiff understood and agreed to this policy at the time she was hired by defendant. Plaintiff was injured as she was traveling to her first patient's home. The Commission concluded that \"[p]laintiff was only paid travel reimbursement for travel between patients' homes and defendant-employer did not transport any employees to and from work. Therefore, the contractual duty exception does not apply in this case.\" The Commission's conclusions are supported by its findings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   We nevertheless agree with plaintiff that her claim was compensable. Plaintiff was required as a condition of employment to use her personal vehicle while at work. \"If the employee as part of his or her job is required to bring along his or her own car, truck or motorcycle for use during the working day, the trip to and from work is by that fact alone embraced within the course of employment.\" 1 Arthur Larson,\n   <em>\n    Larson's Worker's Compensation Law\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 15.05(1) (2006). Professor Larson notes that the reasoning behind the rule\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   is in part related to that of the employer-conveyance cases: the obligations of the job reach out beyond the premises, make the vehicle a mandatory part of the employment environment, and compel the employee to submit to the hazards associated with private motor travel, which otherwise he or she would have the option of avoiding. But in addition there is at work the factor of making the journey part of the job, since it is a service to the employer to convey to the premises a major piece of equipment devoted to the employer's purposes. . . .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"50383\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ark/328/381/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 15.05(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   This rule is followed in a great number of jurisdictions.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g., Olsten Kimberly Quality Care v.

The Court never addressed the issue, however, of whether the claimant should be entitled to compensation because she was required to furnish her own vehicle, and it is unclear whether such a claim was ever raised before the Court. As such, we do not agree that\n   <em>\n    Franklin\n   </em>\n   operates to bar plaintiff's claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Defendant further argues that adoption of the rule would eliminate the contractual duty exception. We do not agree. This rule will expand, not eliminate the contractual duty exception. As Professor Larson cautions,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   care must be exercised not to confuse these cases with the more common cases [involving contractual duty exceptions] in which attention is focused exclusively on the journey itself-in particular, on the question: was the employee paid for the time or expenses of the journey itself - In the present category, it is immaterial whether the employee is compensated for the time or expenses of the journey, since work-connection is independently established by the fact of conveying the vehicle to the operating premises. Indeed, it is quite common in these cases to find that the employee is reimbursed for his or her mileage after he or she reaches the premises and until he or she leaves for home, but specifically not for the going and coming trip. Yet the going and coming trip has repeatedly been held covered in these circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Larson at \u00a7 15.05(2) (footnote omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   It is well established in North Carolina that the Workers' Compensation Act should be liberally construed and that \"`[w]here any reasonable relationship to employment exists, or employment is a contributory cause, the court is justified in upholding the award as \"arising out of employment.\"'\"\n   <em>\n    Kiger v.
