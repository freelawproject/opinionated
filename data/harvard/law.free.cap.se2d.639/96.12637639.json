The law firm of Vandeventer Black LLP was duly appointed and served as the Town Attorney, pursuant to an agreement entered into between defendant Town and the firm on 19 April 2002 and section 160A-173. Womack Newspapers, Inc. (\"plaintiff\"), publishes and does business as\n   <em>\n    The Outer Banks Sentinel\n   </em>\n   (\"\n   <em>\n    The Sentinel\n   </em>\n   \"), a bi-weekly newspaper published in Dare County, North Carolina.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On 13 May 2004, Angela Perez, a reporter for\n   <em>\n    The Sentinel,\n   </em>\n   made a request to the Town pursuant to the Public Records Act, seeking to inspect and copy all of the detailed billing statements from the Town Attorney for legal fees incurred during fiscal years 2003-2004. The Town denied the request on the grounds that the documents were not \"public records\" as that term is defined by our state's Public Records Act, found in North Carolina General Statutes, section 132-1\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   The Town contended the documents contained privileged communications between the Town and its attorney, and therefore were exempt from the Public Records Act pursuant to section 132-1.1. The Town provided summaries of the detailed billing statements which included the general nature of each matter handled by the Town Attorney along with the amount of fees paid by the Town on each matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Following meetings with various Town officials, on 8 June 2004, the editor of\n   <em>\n    The Sentinel\n   </em>\n   wrote a letter to the Kitty Hawk Town Council (\"Council\") requesting that the Council authorize the release of redacted copies of the billing statements. The editor noted in her letter that only the Council could waive the Town's attorney-client privilege, which would be necessary before even redacted copies of the billing statements could be released.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   A special meeting of the Council was called on 17 June 2004, to consider\n   <em>\n    The Sentinel\n   </em>\n   's request to obtain redacted copies of the billing statements sent to the Town by the Town Attorney. The Town Attorney recommended the Council waive the attorney-client privilege in all respects with the exception of billing statements for ongoing litigation and billing statements related to claims which were unresolved and might result in future litigation for the Town. During closed session, the Council voted to waive the Town's attorney-client privilege as to written communications from the Town Attorney regarding the requested billing statements, except for billing statements related to litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Redacted copies of the detailed billing statements from the Town Attorney for fiscal year 2003-2004 subsequently were made available to the public.\n   <em>\n    The Sentinel\n   </em>\n   obtained\n   copies of the redacted billing statements, and then contended that the copies contained far more redaction and obliteration than the Council's vote directed. On 13 July 2004,\n   <em>\n    The Sentinel\n   </em>\n   's editor wrote to members of the Council, notifying them that the billing statements had been redacted to a far greater extent than was directed, and requesting that the Council instruct the Town Manager to release the records in a manner consistent with the Council's 17 June 2004 vote. The Town's Mayor denied\n   <em>\n    The Sentinel\n   </em>\n   's request stating that the Council's vote did not authorize the release of privileged communications between the Town and Town Attorney, and that releasing the documents as requested by\n   <em>\n    The Sentinel\n   </em>\n   would compromise the Town's ability to prosecute and defend present and future claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On 11 August 2004, plaintiff filed a complaint and petition for writ of mandamus, seeking that the trial court order the Town to provide access to, and copies of, the detailed billing records of the Town Attorney for fiscal year 2003-2004, except for those portions as to which the Town asserts its attorney-client privilege in connection with two specific ongoing cases.\n   <em>\n    The Sentinel\n   </em>\n   also sought an order declaring that the requested records were in fact public records as a matter of law. In the alternative,\n   <em>\n    The Sentinel\n   </em>\n   asked the trial court to order the Town to submit complete and unredacted copies of all detailed billing statements from the Town Attorney for fiscal year 2003-2004 for an\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review for a determination as to whether the attorney-client privilege asserted by the Town was well founded. Plaintiff filed an amended complaint on 10 November 2004, adding a request that the trial court also order the Town to \"provide access to and copies of all checks, contracts and/or supporting invoices for land purchases, appraisal, demolition, engineering, surveying and other `Technical Assistance' performed for the Town or on the Town's behalf in conjunction with the Town's oceanfront condemnations.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Defendants filed motions seeking to transfer the action to the superior court division and to dismiss the action based upon a lack of subject matter and personal jurisdiction over defendants. Defendants alleged that the confidential information sought by plaintiff constituted written communications to the Town from its attorney regarding claims, and as such, the information was not a public record as defined by North Carolina General Statutes, section 132-1. Defendants argued that sovereign immunity barred plaintiff's claims. Defendants also filed motions seeking to strike portions of plaintiff's complaint, dismiss the petition for a writ of mandamus based upon Rule 12(b)(6) of our Rules of Civil Procedure, and dismiss the action for failure to join necessary parties and a lack of standing. Plaintiff's action was transferred to Dare County Superior Court on 21 December 2004. Defendants also filed several motions seeking to quash subpoenas which were served upon various Town officials.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In an order entered 7 April 2005, defendants' various motions were denied and defendants were ordered to present the following records for\n   <em>\n    in camera review\n   </em>\n   and inspection:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   a. Complete and unredacted detailed billing records provided to the Town of Kitty Hawk by [the Town Attorney] for Fiscal Year 2003-2004.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   b. Complete and unredacted copies of all checks and supporting invoices for land purchases, engineering and surveying related to the oceanfront and other land condemnations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   c. Complete and unredacted copies of any checks written to Town Attorneys for items and expenses which are not included on their legal billings during the fiscal years indicated above.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   d. Complete and unredacted copies of all contracts and other arrangements by the Town of Kitty Hawk or on its behalf with:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   1. Quible &amp; Associates, P.C.;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   2. Bourne Appraisal Service;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   3. Bamette Integrated Land Services d/b/a/ BILD;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   4. Green Acres Land Development; and/or\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   5. Any other firms or individuals who have rendered services connected with the Town of Kitty Hawk's oceanfront\n   and land condemnations since June 1, 2003.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Defendants gave notice of their appeal from the trial court's 7 April 2005 order and filed a motion seeking to stay the submission of the documents for\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review pending the appeal. However, defendants' notice of appeal was dismissed in an order filed 2 May 2005, on the basis that the order denying defendants' motions was not appealable, and that an attempt to appeal from a nonappealable order was a nullity. Defendants then filed their answer on 25 April 2005, and asserted various counterclaims including a declaration from the trial court as to the rights and obligations of the parties, along with an order enjoining plaintiff from continuing its attempts to obtain and misuse confidential information of defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   After reviewing the disputed documents\n   <em>\n    in camera,\n   </em>\n   the trial court entered its order on 2 June 2005. The trial court held that the records made or received by the Town Attorney, including but not limited to invoices and bills presented to the Town, were presumptively public records as defined by our state's Public Records Act, found in section 132-1\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   The trial court held that \"[s]ubstantive communications from the Town Attorneys to the Town concerning a claim against or on behalf of the Town, or concerning the prosecution, defense, possible settlement or litigation of a judicial action are not public records if they are within the scope of the attorney-client privilege.\" Defendants were ordered to produce, without redaction, all billing records from the Town Attorney to the Town for fiscal year 2003-2004, with the exception of specific entries which the trial court found were subject to the attorney-client privilege. The trial court also ordered that all contracts made on behalf of the Town related to the oceanfront condemnation cases are public records, and that copies of the contracts must be produced in their entirety, with the exception of one specific document. Defendants were ordered to provide immediate public access to the public records described in the order, with the exception of those documents specifically identified as confidential.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Plaintiff filed a motion seeking to dismiss several of defendants' counterclaims, strike portions of defendants' answer and counterclaims, and order sanctions imposed against defendants. Defendants filed their Notice of Appeal on 7 June 2005, appealing from the trial court's orders entered 7 April 2005, 2 May 2005, and 2 June 2005. Plaintiff subsequently filed a motion to dismiss defendants' 7 June 2005 Notice of Appeal and sought enforcement of the trial court's 2 June 2005 order. Defendants voluntarily dismissed without prejudice all of their counterclaims on 27 June 2005. On 7 July 2005, the trial court entered an order granting defendants' motion to stay the 2 June 2005 order and other pre-trial proceedings in the case pending defendants' appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On appeal, defendants present four arguments: (1) the trial court erred in finding the detailed billing statements were \"presumptively\" public records as defined by the Public Records Act; (2) the trial court erred in finding that the contracts were public records as defined by the Public Records Act; (3) the trial court erred in finding that it had subject matter and personal jurisdiction pursuant to the Public Records Act when it ordered defendants to disclose the documents; and (4) the trial court erred in denying defendants' motions to dismiss and strike plaintiff's complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Before addressing the substance of defendants' appeal, we must first address plaintiff's motions to partially dismiss defendants' appeal and plaintiff's motion to dismiss several of defendants' assignments of error for failure to state a legal basis, pursuant to Rule 10(c)(1) of our appellate rules.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   On 13 February 2006, plaintiff filed a motion with this Court seeking to partially dismiss defendants' appeal as moot. The basis for plaintiff's motion stems from events occurring after the entry of the 2 June 2005 order and defendants' giving notice of their appeal. On 9 January 2006, the Kitty Hawk Town Council unanimously passed a resolution approving the release of \"[u]nredacted copies of all statements for services rendered by the Town Attorney to the Town\" for fiscal years 2003-2004 and 2004-2005. Plaintiffs contend that by releasing the disputed documents,\n   unredacted, that defendants have caused their appeal to become moot. On appeal, the primary issue of defendants' argument is that the attorney billing records, in their unredacted state, are not public records subject to disclosure through the Public Records Act. Plaintiff therefore contends that defendants' assignments of error which relate to the trial court's order that defendants release the unredacted billing records should be dismissed as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Defendants counter plaintiff's motion by arguing that while the detailed billing statements were released, they were not released as public records, and thus the issues raised by their appeal are not moot. Defendants argue that they have never treated the billing statements as public records which are subject to the Public Records Act. Defendants also contend this appeal falls within several of the exceptions to mootness, including the exception that the issues presented are \"capable of repetition, yet evading review.\" We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Our courts long have held that\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \"Whenever, during the course of litigation it develops that the relief sought has been granted or that the questions originally in controversy between the parties are no longer at issue, the case should be dismissed, for courts will not entertain or proceed with a cause merely to determine abstract propositions of law. . . .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Unlike the question of jurisdiction, the issue of mootness is not determined solely by examining facts in existence at the commencement of the action. If the issues before a court or administrative body become moot at any time during the course of the proceedings, the usual response should be to dismiss the action.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <em>\n    Pearson v.

In the instant case, plaintiff sought the release of copies of the unredacted billing statements provided to the Town by the Town Attorney for fiscal year 2003-2004. These documents presented are precisely what the Council released pursuant to the resolution it passed 9 January 2006. Although the resolution specifically stated that the subject communications were \"not public records under the Public Records Act,\" the relief sought by plaintiff nonetheless was granted. The fact that defendants did not release the unredacted billing statements as \"public records\" is simply a matter of form over substance, and this does not change the fact that plaintiff has been granted the precise relief sought in its complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Defendants contend that several of the exceptions to the doctrine of mootness apply in the instant case, and therefore we should address the merits of their appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendants' arguments regarding the applicability of the exceptions to mootness are not persuasive. Further, we are bound by this Court's prior holding in\n   <em>\n    N.C. Press Assoc., Inc. v. Spangler,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8358052\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/87/169/\">\n    87 N.C.App. 169\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=360%20S.E.2d%20138\">\n    360 S.E.2d 138\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1987). In\n   <em>\n    Press Association,\n   </em>\n   the primary issue was whether reports submitted by chancellors of several of our state's public universities were public records and therefore subject to disclosure pursuant to our Public Records Act. During the pendency of the appeal with this Court, the defendant in\n   <em>\n    Press Association\n   </em>\n   publically disclosed the reports which were the subject of the appeal. This Court held that the appeal therefore was moot because the question which originally was in controversy was no longer at issue.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=360%20S.E.2d%20138\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=360%20S.E.2d%20138\">\n    at 171\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=360%20S.E.2d%20138\">\n    360 S.E.2d at 139\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"Where a panel of the Court of Appeals has decided the same issue, albeit in a different case, a subsequent panel of the same court is bound by that precedent, unless it has been overturned\n   by a higher court.\"\n   <em>\n    In the Matter of Appeal from Civil Penalty,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2483734\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/324/373/#p384\">\n    324 N.C. 373\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 384,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=379%20S.E.2d%2030\">\n    379 S.E.2d 30\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 37 (1989).

Both\n   <em>\n    City of Burlington\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    McCormick\n   </em>\n   dealt with the issue of whether a governmental entity could file a declaratory action. Both cases held that our Public Records Act does not permit governmental entities to use a declaratory judgment action to determine the entities' rights under the Public Records Act. We held that only the party making the public records request may bring an action to enforce the Public Records Act and determine the rights of all parties under the Act.\n   <em>\n    See City of Burlington,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8410975\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/166/186/#p192\">\n    166 N.C.App. at 192\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=600%20S.E.2d%20872\">\n    600 S.E.2d at 876\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    McCormick,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8898259\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/164/459/#p473\">\n    164 N.C.App. at 464\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=596%20S.E.2d%20431\">\n    596 S.E.2d at 434\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In the instant case, the reporter made the initial public records request in her capacity as a reporter for\n   <em>\n    The Sentinel\n   </em>\n   and on behalf of plaintiff. Thereafter plaintiff's editor made the official written requests to the Town's Council and other Town officers, all of which were done in her capacity as editor of\n   <em>\n    The Sentinel\n   </em>\n   and on behalf of plaintiff. Thus, the party on behalf of which the request was made was a party to the action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   North Carolina General Statutes, section 132-6 provides that \"[e]very custodian of public records shall permit any record in the custodian's custody to be inspected and examined at reasonable times and under reasonable supervision by any person, and shall, as promptly as possible, furnish copies thereof upon payment of any fees as may be prescribed by law.\" N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 132-6(a) (2005). Pursuant to section 160A-171, the office of the town clerk \"shall ... be the custodian of all [town] records.\" N.C. Gen.

Stat. \u00a7 132-2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2005) (\"The public official in charge of an office having public records shall be the custodian thereof.\"). As custodian of the Town's records, the town clerk does not have discretion to prevent inspection and copying of materials which constitute public records under our Public Records Act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 132-6(a) (2005);\n   <em>\n    Virmani v.

However, the town clerk does not have the authority to declare certain documents to be public records without the Council's waiver of privilege and authorization to release the documents. Plaintiff included as parties to the action all town officials involved in the matter who had the authority over, and responsibility for determining whether the requested records constituted public records, and who ultimately were responsible for the Town's compliance with the Public Records Act. The\n   Town Council was the governing body that had the authority to waive the Town's attorney-client privilege and instruct the town clerk as to whether or not the requested records could be disclosed. Based upon the Town's argument that the withheld documents fell within an exception to the Public Records Act, the town clerk lacked the authority to release the requested documents without the approval of the Council.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   In addition, the policy underlying our Public Records Act is designed to give liberal access to public records,\n   <em>\n    see News and Observer Publishing Co. v.

Having named the Town through the Town Council, the Mayor, the individual Town Council members, the Town Manager, and the Town Attorneys as parties to this suit, and given the nature of the documents involved, we cannot hold the town clerk constitutes a necessary party without whom a valid judgment cannot be rendered in this action completely and finally determining the controversy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   As plaintiff has complied with the requirements of our Rules of Civil Procedure, and has included all necessary parties in the action, we hold the trial court acted properly in denying defendants' motion to dismiss plaintiff's complaint for a lack of standing and for failure to join necessary parties pursuant to Rule 12(b)(7) of our Rules of Civil Procedure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Dismissed in part; affirmed in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Judges CALABRIA and GEER concur.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1.\">\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    Defendants contend the instant case involves an issue which is \"capable of repetition, yet evading review.\"\n    <em>\n     See Boney Publishers, Inc. v.
