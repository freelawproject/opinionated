We consider whether the petitioner, James Darrell West, is entitled to relief for his claim that he was denied his Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel. West bases his claim on counsel's failure to raise at trial a double jeopardy challenge to West's convictions of both aggravated involuntary manslaughter and involuntary manslaughter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I. Proceedings\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   West was indicted for aggravated involuntary manslaughter of Burlia Gene Jenkins, Jr., in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-36.1, common law involuntary manslaughter of Jenkins, punishable under Code \u00a7 18.2-36, and operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol (DUI), in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-266. West was convicted of these offenses after a bench trial in the Circuit Court of Henrico County.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The circuit court sentenced West to ten years' imprisonment with five years suspended for the aggravated involuntary manslaughter conviction, five years' imprisonment for the common law involuntary manslaughter conviction, and a suspended jail sentence of 30 days for the DUI conviction. The circuit court ordered that the sentences for aggravated involuntary manslaughter and common law involuntary manslaughter be served concurrently.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Court of Appeals affirmed West's convictions.\n   <em>\n    West v.

We placed this proceeding on our privileged docket, limited to the following question:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Was counsel's failure to object to petitioner's convictions for both involuntary manslaughter and aggravated involuntary manslaughter as violating double jeopardy prejudicial within the meaning of\n   <em>\n    Strickland v. Washington,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/\">\n    466 U.S. 668\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/\">\n    80 L.Ed.2d 674\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1984), and, if so, can this Court grant relief where the remedy will not result in petitioner's release from prison as his sentences are being served concurrently?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   II. Facts\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On April 17, 2002, Burlia Gene Jenkins, Jr. died from injuries sustained in a car accident. The accident occurred when the vehicle West was driving struck the rear of Jenkins' truck, causing the truck to veer from the road and overturn. Two hours after the accident, West was given a test to determine his blood alcohol content. The test showed that West's blood alcohol content was .10 by weight by volume.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   At trial, the Commonwealth asserted that the Fifth Amendment Double Jeopardy Clause would not bar a conviction for both involuntary manslaughter and aggravated involuntary manslaughter. The Commonwealth contended that the common law offense of involuntary manslaughter was not a lesser-included offense of the statutory crime of aggravated involuntary manslaughter. At the sentencing hearing, however, the Commonwealth asked that the circuit court \"let the Court of Appeals determine which conviction lies.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In response, West moved to strike the aggravated involuntary manslaughter conviction, arguing that the Commonwealth was required to \"make an election\" between that offense and the involuntary manslaughter conviction. West did not state, however, that his argument rested on constitutional or double jeopardy grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   III. Discussion\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   West argues that based on his counsel's failure to raise a double jeopardy objection to\n   his convictions for both aggravated involuntary manslaughter and common law involuntary manslaughter, he was prejudiced within the meaning of\n   <em>\n    Strickland.\n   </em>\n   West contends that absent counsel's ineffective assistance, West would not have been convicted of common law involuntary manslaughter. He further asserts that if he had not been convicted of that offense, he would have qualified under the sentencing guidelines provided pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-298.01 for a lower recommended sentence on the aggravated involuntary manslaughter conviction. Thus, West maintains, the circuit court would have imposed a shorter penitentiary sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In response, the Commonwealth argues that West was not prejudiced within the meaning of\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   because he has failed to establish that the circuit court would have imposed a lesser punishment had the common law involuntary manslaughter charge been dismissed. According to the Commonwealth, because the sentencing guidelines are not mandatory, any increase in the guideline range of punishment resulting from West's conviction on both manslaughter charges would not support a conclusion of prejudice. Alternatively, the Commonwealth argues that even if West was prejudiced by counsel's error, this Court lacks jurisdiction to vacate West's common law involuntary manslaughter conviction because such relief would not result in his immediate release.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In deciding these issues, we first consider whether West was denied his Sixth Amendment right to counsel based on counsel's failure to argue at trial that the Fifth Amendment Double Jeopardy Clause barred West from being convicted of both the aggravated involuntary manslaughter and the common law involuntary manslaughter charges. The Sixth Amendment right to counsel includes the right to the effective assistance of counsel.\n   <em>\n    Yarborough v.

The fact that the circuit court imposed the sentences concurrently, rather than consecutively, does not alter our conclusion that West was prejudiced. The sentences were separately imposed and, but for counsel's failure, West would have received only one felony conviction with one accompanying punishment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In reaching this conclusion, we reject West's argument that he also suffered prejudice because his conviction of the two felony offenses made him subject to an increased range of punishment under the sentencing guidelines. West's argument is without merit because the guidelines provided by Code \u00a7 19.2-298.01 are discretionary, rather than mandatory. Under that statute, the circuit court was required only to consider the sentencing guidelines before sentencing West and to file with the record of the case a written explanation of any departure from the indicated range of punishment. Code \u00a7 19.2-298.01(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Moreover, the statute further provides that the \"failure to follow any or all of the provisions in this section or the failure to follow any or all of the provisions of this section in the prescribed manner shall not be reviewable on appeal or the basis of other post-conviction relief.\" Code \u00a7 19.2-298.01(F). Thus, the fact that the sentencing guidelines in West's case may have been different had he been convicted only of one, instead of two felonies, does not provide him any basis for post-conviction relief on the aggravated involuntary manslaughter conviction in this habeas corpus petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Because West suffered prejudice as defined by\n   <em>\n    Strickland,\n   </em>\n   we must consider the appropriate relief that he should be afforded. The Commonwealth requests that this Court, in the exercise of its discretion, decline to grant West relief from his common law involuntary manslaughter conviction by applying the \"concurrent sentencing doctrine.\" The question whether we should apply this \"doctrine\" presents an issue of first impression in this Commonwealth.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Other jurisdictions, through application of the \"concurrent sentencing doctrine,\" have selectively exercised their discretion to decline review of the validity of a defendant's criminal conviction when 1) a defendant has received two or more concurrent sentences on multiple counts of an indictment; 2) one or more of those convictions is not challenged or is upheld as valid; and 3) a ruling in the defendant's favor on the remaining conviction would not reduce the period of imprisonment the defendant is required to serve on the valid conviction or convictions.\n   <em>\n    See Williams v.

Addressing the merits of this doctrine, we observe that the doctrine assigns a higher priority to concerns of judicial efficiency than to relief entitled a petitioner under our federal constitution. Because acceptance of such a perspective would close the doors of our courts to many petitioners regardless of the merits of their claims, we decline to apply the \"concurrent sentencing doctrine\" in Virginia. Instead, we adopt the view expressed by the Supreme Court of Georgia that the burden of any inconvenience in the administration of our justice system \"should rest on the shoulders of the judiciary rather than on those of an imprisoned petitioner.\"\n   <em>\n    Atkins,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=216%20S.E.2d%2089\">\n    216 S.E.2d at 91\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
