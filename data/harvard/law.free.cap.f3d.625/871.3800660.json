SMITH, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b898-4\">Travis Houston appeals his seven-year sentence imposed for brandishing a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(ii) (2006). He argues that, because he was subject to a 25-year mandatory minimum sentence under \u00a7 924(c)(1)(C)\u00ae, the district court should not have imposed an additional consecutive seven-year sentence pursuant to \u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(ii). Because Houston\u2019s seven-year and 25-year sentences were for separate crimes, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-6\">While Michael Floyd, a truck driver for Grocery Supply Co. (\u201cGSC\u201d), was stopped at a red light in San Antonio, Texas, Houston ran up to the truck\u2019s window brandishing a handgun and demanded to be let in. Houston then moved Floyd over to the passenger seat and drove toward Austin, Texas.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-7\">Two hours later, in Austin, Houston spotted another GSC truck off the freeway making its delivery at a convenience store. Houston said, \u201cThere\u2019s my truck,\u201d exited the freeway, parked near the convenience store, and waited for the other truck to finish its delivery. As David Cruz, Jr., along with his co-worker Michael Bilicek, drove their truck from the store, Houston positioned his truck to block the road. As Cruz\u2019s truck approached, Houston exited his vehicle and ran toward Cruz\u2019s truck with his gun in hand while shouting at Cruz to stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-8\">As Cruz tried to drive around the truck Houston had left blocking the road, Houston jumped onto the steps to the passenger side door of Cruz\u2019s truck and held on to the truck. Cruz sped up and swerved the truck back and forth, and Bilicek repeatedly kicked the passenger side window, but Houston hung on to the vehicle. Houston then fired his gun into the cab, shattering the passenger side window and spraying glass shards onto Cruz and Bilicek. Cruz steered the truck toward a ditch and jumped out, breaking his leg. Houston also jumped off, before the truck, with Bilicek inside it, crashed into an occupied car and fell into the ditch.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-11\">Francisco Aleman was washing his cement truck nearby when he heard the gunshot and the crash, and he ran over to the crash site. He saw Houston running toward him and asked whether he needed any help, at which point Houston pulled out his gun, pointed it at Aleman, told him to \u201cback up,\u201d pushed him up to the cement truck, and asked for Aleman\u2019s key to the truck. The engine of another cement truck was already running, however, so Houston' took that truck and drove off. Using the truck\u2019s GPS system, police apprehended Houston shortly thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-13\">Houston was convicted of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, three counts of taking a motor vehicle by force, and two counts of obstructing interstate commerce by robbery, for which he received sentences ranging from 120 to 240 months of imprisonment, to run concurrently. In addition, he was convicted of two counts of brandishing a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c). He was sentenced to seven years of imprisonment on the first \u00a7 924(c) count and 25 years on the second, both sentences to run consecutively to all other counts. He appeals the imposition of the seven-year consecutive sentence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b899-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-5\">Section \u00a7 924(c)(1) says, in pertinent part,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b899-6\">(A)(i) <em>Except to the extent that a greater minimum sentence is otherwise provided by this subsection </em>or by any other provision of law, any person who, <em>during and in relation to </em>any crime of violence or drug trafficking crime ... for which the person may be prosecuted in a court of the United States, uses or carries a firearm, or who, in furtherance of any such crime, possesses a firearm, shall, in addition to the punishment provided for such crime of violence or drug trafficking crime\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b899-7\">... (ii) if the firearm is brandished, be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than 7 years;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b899-8\">(C) In the case of a second or subsequent conviction under this subsection, the person shall\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b899-9\">(i) be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than 25 years....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ALR\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1) (emphasis added). Houston contends that the district court erred in imposing both a seven-year consecutive sentence for the first count of brandishing a firearm and a 25-year consecutive sentence for the second count, because \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A) prohibits imposing the seven-year \u00a7 924(c) sentence \u201cto the extent that a greater minimum sentence is otherwise provided by [\u00a7 924(c)].\u201d We</p>\n<p id=\"b899-13\">must therefore decide whether a greater minimum sentence for a second or subsequent \u00a7 924(c) offense qualifies as a \u201cgreater minimum sentence ... otherwise provided by [\u00a7 924(c)].\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b899-14\">The language of a statute, like all language, \u201ccannot be interpreted apart from context.\u201d <em>Smith v. United States, </em>508 U.S. 223, 229, 113 S.Ct. 2050, 124 L.Ed.2d 138 (1993). The so-called \u201cexcept\u201d clause of \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A)\u00ae \u201cdoes not say \u2018a greater minimum sentence\u2019 <em>for what; </em>yet it has to have <em>some </em>understood referent to be intelligible.\u201d <em>United States v. Parker, </em>549 F.3d 5, 11 (1st Cir.2008). One such referent is that the clause applies only to sentences concerning firearm possession.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The question is whether the \u201cexcept\u201d clause also covers a \u201cgreater minimum sentence\u201d for possession of the same firearm during a subsequent crime committed later in the same day.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-15\">The issue is one of first impression, but the Second Circuit has come close to addressing it directly. In <em>United States v. Williams, </em>558 F.3d 166, 171-72 (2d Cir. 2009) <em>(dictum), </em>it observed (and in <em>United States v. Parker, </em>577 F.3d 143, 147 (2d Cir.2009), it held) that the so-called \u201cexcept\u201d clause of \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A) applies only to conduct arising from the same criminal transaction or set of operative facts as the crime yielding the greater mandatory minimum sentence. Thus, in <em>Parker, </em>the mandatory minimum sentence arising from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>possession of crack cocaine between April 30 and May 1 did not preclude an additional consecutive sentence for conduct arising from possession of crack cocaine on July 19, because those were different transactions. <em>Parker, </em>577 F.3d at 147.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-4\">In support of its holding, the Second Circuit relied on \u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(i)\u2019s reference to the use or carrying of a firearm \u201cduring and in relation to,\u201d or possession \u201cin furtherance of,\u201d a crime of violence or drug trafficking offense. <em>Id.; Williams, </em>558 F.3d at 171. The problem with that reasoning, however, is that the phrases \u201csame transaction\u201d and \u201cset of operative facts\u201d are procedural terms of art that mean neither \u201cduring\u201d nor \u201cin furtherance of\u2019 a crime of violence or drug trafficking offense.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b900-5\">For example, if a defendant robbed a bank and then stole a vehicle containing an unregistered firearm, a charge for possession of an unregistered firearm could form part of the same \u201ctransaction\u201d as the bank robbery charge, even if the firearm was not carried \u201cduring\u201d or possessed \u201cin furtherance of\u2019 the robbery.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In short, there is a logical gap between the Second Circuit\u2019s test and the statutory language it relies on. Although the statute is admittedly \u201cnot a model of clarity,\u201d <em>Collins, </em>205 Fed.Appx. at 198, that does not sanction importing a doctrine found nowhere in the statute, let alone one as vague as the \u201csame transaction\u201d test.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-10\">There is a more faithful interpretation of the statute. Section \u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(i) imposes a mandatory minimum sentence for using or carrying a firearm \u201cduring and in relation\u201d to a crime of violence or drug trafficking crime or for possessing a firearm \u201cin furtherance of\u2019 such a crime, unless \u00a7 924(c) or another provision of law imposes a greater mandatory minimum sentence. Just as we thought in <em>Collins </em>that the statute\u2019s \u201cgreater mandatory minimum sentence\u201d exception most reasonably refers only to another, greater sentence for firearm possession, <em>id., </em>so too does it most reasonably refer only to a greater mandatory minimum sentence for <em>that specific crime </em>of firearm possession.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b900-11\">In addition to being the most natural reading of \u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(i), that interpretation avoids the odd result produced by the Second Circuit\u2019s reading, whereby a second conviction under \u00a7 924(c)(1)(C) precludes any imprisonment for the first conviction if the two crimes occurred in close proximity. \u201cA determination of guilt that yields no sentence is not a judgment of conviction at all.\u201d <em>Easter, </em>553 F.3d at 526. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>The Second Circuit\u2019s interpretation would thus be proper only if \u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(i) were only a sentencing enhancement provision. But it is not an enhancement provision; it defines a standalone crime.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b901-5\">Finally, the reasoning we adopt meets the goals identified by the Second Circuit. We avoid making the length of a sentence turn on whether prosecutors charged the defendant in separate prosecutions instead of in a multi-count indictment.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Moreover, we avoid giving a defendant a lighter sentence just because he was \u201calready sentenced for a prior unrelated crime in a previous case.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>558 F.3d at 172.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-6\">In sum, \u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(i)\u2019s reference to a \u201cgreater mandatory minimum sentence\u201d refers only to a greater mandatory minimum for <em>that specific offense. </em>Therefore, the district court did not err in sentencing Houston to consecutive terms of seven years for his first firearm offense and 25 years for his second.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b898-9\">. Although Houston also argues that his conviction for felony firearm possession pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) (2006) violates the Interstate Commerce Clause, he concedes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>that that argument is foreclosed by <em>United States </em>v. <em>Rawls, </em>85 F.3d 240, 242 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b899-11\">.

London, </em>568 F.3d 553, 564 (5th Cir.2009), and the government moved for summary affirmance. We denied summary affirmance, however, because <em>London </em>does not address the issue we face.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b899-16\">. <em>London, </em>568 F.3d at 564 (adopting reasoning and holding of <em>United States v.
