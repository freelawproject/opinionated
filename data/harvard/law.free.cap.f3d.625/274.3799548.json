He contends that the district court erred by increasing his offense level by 16 levels based on 1997 California convictions of making criminal threats, under California Penal Code \u00a7 422, and will<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>ful infliction of corporal injury, under California Penal Code \u00a7 273.5. The district court determined that each offense is a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d warranting the 16-level adjustment.</p>\n<p id=\"Aby\">Cruz-Rodriguez argues that neither offense is a crime of violence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii). Because he raises his contention for the first time on appeal, our review is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Lopez-Velasquez, </em>526 F.3d 804, 806 (5th Cir.2008). A plain error is a forfeited error that is clear or obvious and affects the defendant\u2019s substantial rights. <em>United States v. Ellis, </em>564 F.3d 370, 377 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 371, 175 L.Ed.2d 124 (2009). When those elements are shown, this court has the discretion to correct the error only if it \u201cseriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"AYQ\">The term, crime of violence, is defined as \u201cmurder, manslaughter, kidnapping, aggravated assault, forcible sex offenses, statutory rape, sexual abuse of a minor, robbery, arson, extortion, extortionate extension of credit, burglary of a dwelling, or any offense under federal, state, or local law that has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 cmt. l(B)(iii). We agree with Cruz-Rodriguez that neither offense is specifically enumerated in the Sentencing Guidelines\u2019 definition. Cruz-Rodriguez also argues, however, that the 16-level adjustment was error because neither offense \u201chas as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"A5LB\">With respect to the willful infliction of corporal injury offense, we previously rejected this argument in an unpublished opinion, holding that California Penal Code \u00a7 237.5(a) \u201cpenalizes the intentional use of force that results in a traumatic condition.\u201d <em>United States v. Gutierrez, </em>371 Fed.Appx. 550, 551 (5th Cir.2010) (unpublished) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). We find this reasoning persuasive. Moreover, our previous decision is consistent with the Ninth Circuit\u2019s analysis of \u00a7 237.5(a). <em>United States v. Laurico-Yeno, </em>590 F.3d 818, 820 (9th Cir.2010), cert. <em>denied, </em>- U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 216, 2010 WL 2551985 (2010) (\u201cBecause the use of physical force against the person of another is an element of the statute, we hold that California Penal Code \u00a7 273.5 is a categorical crime of violence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2.\u201d). Accordingly, we hold that the offense of willful infliction of corporal injury is a crime of violence for the purpose of sentence adjustments under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"Aok\">On the other hand, with respect to the offense of making a criminal threat, we previously held in an unpublished opinion that \u201cthe use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another\u201d is not an element of California Penal Code \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) \u201cbecause it is possible under [California] law for the State to obtain a conviction under ... the terroristic threats statute without proof of the threatened use of physical force against another person .... \u201d <em>United States v. De La Rosa-Hernandez, </em>264 Fed.Appx. 446, 447-49 (5th Cir.2008) (unpublished) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted) (alteration in original). We likewise find this reasoning persuasive. In addition, this court reached the same conclusion with respect to a similar Pennsylvania statute, holding that the generic terroristic-threat offense at issue in that case is not a crime of violence. <em>United States v. Ortiz-Gomez, </em>562 F.3d 683, 684-86 (5th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>Cir.2009). Therefore, we hold that the offense of making a criminal threat is not a crime of violence for the purpose of sentencing adjustments under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">Accordingly, the district court erred by relying on the criminal threat conviction in adjusting Cruz-Rodriguez\u2019s sentence. Nevertheless, that error did not affect his substantial rights and, therefore, did not constitute reversible plain error. <em>See United States v. Garza, </em>587 F.3d 304, 309, 313 (5th Cir.2009). The 16-level adjustment was appropriate solely on the basis of Cruz-Rodriguez\u2019s conviction for willfully inflicting a corporal injury. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
