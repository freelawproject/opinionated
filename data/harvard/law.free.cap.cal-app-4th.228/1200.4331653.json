(Dr. Pepper); (2) Mott\u2019s LP (Mott\u2019s); (3) Larry D. Young <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1203\">*1203</page-number>(Young); (4) Caesar Vargas (Vargas); and (5) Graham Bailey (Bailey). The causes of action included (a) wrongful termination against Dr. Pepper and Mott\u2019s; (b) sex discrimination against all defendants; and (c) breach of contract against Dr. Pepper and Mott\u2019s. The trial court sustained, without leave to amend, the demurrer of Dr. Pepper, Vargas, Bailey, and Mott\u2019s. The trial court also sanctioned Carlton and his trial counsel jointly and severally in the amount of $1,360 due to Carlton\u2019s \u201cwholly unjustified\u201d interrogatory responses.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-4\">The only respondent on appeal is Dr. Pepper; the other defendants are not respondents in this appeal. Carlton contends the trial court erred by granting the demurrer because the demurrer was untimely. Next, Carlton asserts the demurrer improperly included the breach of contract cause of action, and therefore the trial court erred by sustaining the demurrer on that cause of action. Lastly, Carlton contends the trial court erred by imposing sanctions. We reverse in part, and affirm in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-5\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b999-6\">A. <em>Incident</em></p>\n<p id=\"b999-7\">The facts in this part are taken from the SAC. In the SAC, Carlton asserts he was \u201cemployed with the company.\u201d It is unclear if Carlton\u2019s employer was Dr. Pepper or Mott\u2019s. Carlton contends he worked as a production manager for the company beginning in April 2009 and had an unblemished performance record. On December 16, 2010, Carlton was at a biweekly management meeting with Terry Gordon, Blaise Batush, Tammy Sloan (Sloan), and Steve Summey. While waiting for the meeting to begin, Carlton received a text message on his personal cell phone.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-8\">Carlton looked at the message in plain view of Sloan, who was seated to Carlton\u2019s immediate right. The textual portion of the message read, \u201c \u2018Hope your day is going better th[a]n this guy.\u2019 \u201d A picture included with the message reflected \u201ca man sitting on a toilet with his penis appearing to be caught between the base of the toilet and the seat.\u201d Carlton handed the telephone to Sloan, who laughed and said, \u201c \u2018I\u2019d like to meet this man.\u2019 \u201d Sloan showed the text message to Steve Summey who also found the message humorous, and the telephone was returned to Carlton. Terry Gordon asked, \u201cwhat is so funny,\u201d so Carlton gave the telephone to him, and he also found the message humorous. Passing around the telephone lasted approximately 30 seconds, then the meeting began, and the meeting lasted approximately 45 minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1204\">*1204</page-number>Later that same day, Sloan was in Carlton\u2019s office when Bailey entered. Bailey is a manager. Sloan told Bailey, \u201c \u2018[Y]ou\u2019ve got to see this picture.\u2019 \u201d Carlton said, \u201c \u2018This is [Sloan\u2019s] new boyfriend.\u2019 \u201d Bailey responded, \u201c \u2018Oh my God . . . poor guy!\u2019 \u201d Sloan and Bailey then left Carlton\u2019s office.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-4\">Vargas works in human resources. On December 16, 2010, Vargas instructed Carlton to accompany Vargas to the human resources office. Vargas informed Carlton that Vargas had received several complaints about the picture; however, Carlton alleges only one complaint was made and it came from Steve Summey. Bailey joined the meeting and told Carlton he \u201c \u2018take[s] this stuff very seriously.\u2019 \u201d Bailey suspended Carlton pending an investigation. Carlton was ordered to return his badge, company cell phone, and keys. Due to the suspension, Carlton sought medical treatment for anxiety and suicidal ideations. Carlton was terminated effective December 21, 2010, \u201cfor \u2018inappropriate behavior and failure to follow [the] Anti-Harassment Policy.\u2019 \u201d Bailey signed Carlton\u2019s termination letter. No one else was suspended or terminated in connection with sharing the picture.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-5\">B. <em>Original and First Amended Complaints</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1000-6\">On July 15, 2011, Carlton filed his original complaint against Dr. Pepper, Young, Vargas, and Bailey. The complaint included causes of action for wrongful termination, sexual discrimination, and breach of contract. On October 24, 2011, Carlton filed his first amended complaint (FAC), which added Mott\u2019s as a defendant and omitted the sexual discrimination cause of action. In the FAC, the wrongful termination cause of action was brought against all defendants, and the breach of contract action was against Dr. Pepper and Mott\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-7\">The wrongful termination cause of action set forth the facts of the text message/picture sharing incident and subsequent termination, described <em>ante. </em>The breach of contract cause of action included allegations that Carlton could not be fired without cause and that Carlton had an unblemished performance record. Carlton asserted he had an employment contract guaranteeing a safe and friendly environment free of verbal harassment. In the breach of contract claim, Carlton asserted he was falsely accused of sexual harassment and therefore \u201cwrongfully terminated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-8\">Dr. Pepper, Mott\u2019s,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Vargas, and Bailey (collectively defendants) demurred to the FAC.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Defendants asserted the wrongful termination cause of action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1205\">*1205</page-number>could only be brought against an employer, thus the individual defendants could not be sued for wrongful termination. In regard to Mott\u2019s and Dr. Pepper, defendants argued the wrongful termination cause of action failed because Carlton did not allege the companies violated public policy. In regard to Carlton being the only employee who was fired, defendants asserted Carlton was the only employee who showed the picture to a female employee (Sloan).</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-5\">As to the breach of contract cause of action, defendants asserted the action failed due to uncertainty. Defendants argued Carlton did not allege (1) whether the contract was written, oral, or implied; (2) the essential terms of the contract; (3) his performance of the contract; (4) how all defendants breached the contract; and (5) how Carlton was damaged by the breach.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-6\">On January 5, 2012, the trial court held a hearing on the demurrer to the FAC. At the beginning of the hearing, the trial court explained that the wrongful termination cause of action \u201cneeds to be amended to clearly layout <em>[sic] </em>the rationale, or reasons for \u2014 purported reasons for the termination.\u201d The court also noted that wrongful termination could not be brought against individual, nonemployer, defendants. The court concluded Carlton \u201claid out the requisite elements for breach of contract.\u201d Therefore, the court said its tentative opinion was to sustain the demurrer for the wrongful termination action, but overrule the demurrer for the breach of contract action. The court adopted its tentative opinion as its ruling. In regard to amending, the court gave Carlton 30 days to amend as to the company, but denied leave to amend the wrongful termination action as to the individual defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-7\">C. <em>Second Amended Complaint</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1001-8\">On February 3, 2012, Carlton filed his SAC, listing Dr. Pepper, Mott\u2019s, Vargas, Bailey, and Young as defendants. The SAC included three causes of action: (1) wrongful termination against Dr. Pepper and Mott\u2019s; (2) breach of contract against Dr. Pepper and Mott\u2019s; and (3) sex discrimination against all defendants. The wrongful termination action again set forth the factual allegations of Carlton sharing the text message/picture and being terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-9\">The breach of contract cause of action again included allegations that Carlton could not be fired without cause and that Carlton had an unblemished performance record. Carlton again asserted he had an employment contract guaranteeing a safe and friendly environment free of verbal harassment. The breach of contract claim again reflected Carlton was falsely accused of sexual harassment and therefore \u201cwrongfully terminated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1206\">*1206</page-number>In the sexual discrimination cause of action, Carlton alleged that by terminating Carlton, but not Sloan, for sharing the picture, Carlton was singled out due to his gender. Carlton further alleged that Bailey created a hostile work environment for Carlton by harassing him \u201cwith name calling like, \u2018Gay guy,\u2019 suggesting that he works out at \u2018Curves\u2019 a female gym and further suggesting that [Carlton] sleeps with other men.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-4\">An exhibit was included with the SAC. The exhibit was a right-to-sue letter from California\u2019s Department of Fair Employment and Housing. The letter reflected Carlton could sue Mott\u2019s due to being terminated based upon sex discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-5\">D. <em>Demurrer</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1002-6\">On March 9, 2012, defendants filed a demurrer to the SAC. As to the wrongful termination cause of action, defendants argued Carlton failed to allege Mott\u2019s and Dr. Pepper violated a public policy. In regard to the breach of contract cause of action, defendants asserted the allegations were uncertain because Carlton failed to allege (1) whether the contract was oral or written, (2) the essential terms of the contract, (3) Carlton\u2019s performance of the contract, (4) a breach by Dr. Pepper and Mott\u2019s, and (5) how Carlton was damaged.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-7\">As to the sex discrimination cause of action, defendants asserted individual defendants could not be liable for a management decision later found to be discriminatory. Vargas was the human resources official who suspended Carlton, and Bailey was the manager who signed Carlton\u2019s termination letter. Therefore, defendants argued the individual defendants could not be liable. Further, defendants asserted Carlton failed to exhaust his administrative remedies because he filed his original complaint, which included the discrimination claim, approximately five months before receiving his right-to-sue letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-8\">Additionally, defendants asserted the discrimination cause of action failed because the administrative complaint did not set forth the details of the alleged discrimination, it only reflected Carlton was terminated as a result of sex discrimination and so that the employer could \u201creplace [Carlton] with a more favorable employee.\u201d Further, defendants asserted the discrimination claim could not be maintained against Dr. Pepper or the individual defendants because only Mott\u2019s was named in the administrative complaint. Lastly, defendants argued Carlton\u2019s sex discrimination claim failed as to all defendants because Carlton failed to allege he was a member of a protected class, in that he alleged he is male and the employee who replaced him is also male.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1207\">*1207</page-number>On April 2, 2012, Carlton filed an objection to the demurrer. Carlton asserted defendant\u2019s demurrer was untimely because \u201c[according to Rule [3.]1320(j) a party has 10 days to answer or otherwise plead to the complaint or the remaining causes of action\u201d (1) when a demurrer is overruled, (2) following the expiration of the time to amend, if the demurrer was sustained with leave to amend, or (3) following \u201c[t]he sustaining of the demurrer if the demurrer was sustained without leave to amend.\u201d Carlton asserted he was given until February 20, 2012, to amend the FAC, so defendants exceed their time to demurrer to the SAC.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-5\">E. <em>Hearing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1003-6\">On April 11, 2012, the trial court held a hearing on defendants\u2019 demurrer to Carlton\u2019s SAC. The trial court asked Carlton\u2019s attorney (Foroozandeh) to explain his objection to the demurrer. Foroozandeh explained, \u201cOn January 5, 2012, you granted leave to amend the first amended complaint. So they have 30 days to answer. That would put it on February 5, 2012. Now, ten days to demurrer, plus five days for mailing, your Honor, that would put it around February 20th. So, the demurrer is untimely.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-7\">Defendants argued that the rule of court cited by Carlton conflicted with Code of Civil Procedure section 471.5,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which grants 30 days (not 10 days) to respond to an amended complaint. Additionally, defendants asserted Carlton\u2019s objection to the demurrer was \u201can invented reason\u201d because Carlton defaulted on opposing the demurrer \u2014 the objection was filed two days after the deadline passed to oppose the demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-8\">The trial court overruled Carlton\u2019s objection. The trial court explained, \u201cI do not think it is the appropriate legal response to object to it as being untimely . . . .\u201d Foroozandeh requested two weeks to respond to the demurrer. The court denied the request and explained the argument about the untimely demurrer should have been presented in a \u201cproper opposition to the demurrer,\u201d which would have also set forth reasons why the demurrer was not well founded.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-9\">The trial court asked Foroozandeh how the wrongful termination cause of action in the SAC was different from the wrongful termination cause of action in the FAC. Foroozandeh explained that the individual defendants had been removed but he believed no additional facts needed to be alleged after the FAC; he believed the problem with the wrongful termination claim in the FAC only concerned needing to remove the individual defendants. Defendants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1208\">*1208</page-number>asserted the court sustained the demurrer to the FAC with leave to amend on the wrongful termination claim, as to the company, so that Carlton could allege sufficient facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-4\">Defendants asserted the wrongful termination and discrimination claims were intertwined. Defendants argued both claims failed against Dr. Pepper because only Mott\u2019s was named in the administrative complaint. Defendants also asserted the discrimination claim failed because the fact that Sloan was not fired did not create a cause of action \u2014 Carlton could properly be fired for his admitted act of sharing the picture.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-5\">As to the breach of contract cause of action, defendants asserted Carlton admitted not having a written contract, but failed to plead the specifics of an oral or implied contract. Defendants argued that Carlton only alleged he had to be fired for cause, and the complaint reflected Carlton was fired for cause; therefore, Carlton had \u201cpied himself out of the court,\u201d and also failed to plead the required specifics of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-6\">Carlton\u2019s attorney (Foroozandeh) argued that everyone in the workplace should be treated equally, so the other people who shared the picture should have been admonished in the same way. Foroozandeh further argued that it was inappropriate for a manager to insinuate a person is homosexual regardless of whether the person is heterosexual or homosexual. In regard to the breach of contract claim, Foroozandeh argued the specifics of the oral contract \u201cneed[] to come out during the trial, it needs to come out during discovery.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-7\">Defendants asserted Foroozandeh was not arguing that Carlton was wrongfully terminated; rather, he was arguing that other people should have been fired as well. Defendants argued that whether Sloan was fired is irrelevant. Foroozandeh again argued it was wrong to single out one person for punishment when multiple people were involved. Foroozandeh also argued the court had already overruled the demurrer to the FAC for the breach of contract action, so the demurrer should not be sustained for that claim since \u201c[n]othing has changed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-8\">Foroozandeh concluded, \u201cThe facts are exactly what they are, and we intend to go to trial and prove it.\u201d The court asked, \u201cAre you telling me you have no additional facts to plead?\u201d Foroozandeh responded, \u201cNot at this time, your Honor.\u201d The trial court sustained the demurrer as to all three causes of action without leave to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1209\">*1209</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-5\">A. <em>Untimely Demurrer</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1005-6\">Carlton contends defendants\u2019 demurrer to the SAC was untimely because defendants had only 10 days after the filing of the SAC to file a demurrer. Dr. Pepper asserts Carlton failed to provide sufficient legal argument, and therefore this court may dismiss the issue. We choose to address the merits of the contention because Carlton provided some legal argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-7\">\u201c ' \u201cThe interpretation of a statute is a question of law, which we review de nova. [Citation.]\u201d [Citation.]\u2019 [Citation.] \u2018Under settled canons of statutory construction, in construing a statute we ascertain the Legislature\u2019s intent in order to effectuate the law\u2019s purpose. [Citation.] We must look to the statute\u2019s words and give them their usual and ordinary meaning. [Citation.] The statute\u2019s plain meaning controls the court\u2019s interpretation unless its words are ambiguous. If the plain language of a statute is unambiguous, no court need, or should, go beyond that pure expression of legislative intent. [Citation.]\u2019 [Citation.] \u2018In doing so, however, we do not consider the statutory language in isolation. [Citation.] Rather, we look to \u201cthe entire substance of the statute ... in order to determine the scope and purpose of the provision . . . .\u201d [Citation.] We avoid any construction that would produce absurd consequences.\u2019 [Citation.] It is a \u2018basic rule of statutory construction [that]: insofar as possible, we must harmonize code sections relating to the same subject matter and avoid interpretations that render related provisions nugatory.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Bright v. 99$ Only Stores </em>(2010) 189 Cal.App.4th 1472, 1477-1478 [118 Cal.Rptr.3d 723].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-9\">California Rules of Court, rule 3.1320(j) provides, \u201cUnless otherwise ordered, defendant has 10 days to answer or otherwise plead to the complaint or the remaining causes of action following: [\u00b6] (1) The overruling of the demurrer; [][] (2) The expiration of the time to amend if the demurrer was sustained with leave to amend; or [\u00b6] (3) The sustaining of the demurrer if the demurrer was sustained without leave to amend.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-10\">Section 471.5, subdivision (a) provides, in relevant part, \u201cIf the complaint is amended, a copy of the amendments shall be filed . . . and a copy of the amendments or amended complaint must be served upon the defendants affected thereby. The defendant shall answer the amendments, or the complaint as amended, within 30 days after service thereof, or such other time as the court may direct, and judgment by default may be entered upon failure to answer, as in other cases.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1210\">*1210</page-number>California Rules of Court, rule 3.1320(j) provides a 10-day filing period, while the statute provides a 30-day filing period. The statute only applies when an amended complaint is filed. Therefore, to read the statute and rule in harmony, the rule must be read to apply when an amended complaint is <em>not </em>filed. Thus, the 10-day rule would apply when a plaintiff is granted leave to amend but elects <em>not to amend, </em>and the statute\u2019s 30-day period would apply when a plaintiff <em>does amend.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1006-4\">In this case, since Carlton did amend by filing the SAC, the statute\u2019s 30-day filing period applied. The SAC was mailed from within California to defendants\u2019 attorney on February 3, 2012. Service by mail from within California adds five calendar days. (\u00a7 1013, subd. (a).) Therefore, service would have been February 8, 2012. February had 29 days in 2012. The first day is excluded (\u00a7 12), which makes March 9 the 30th day. Defendants\u2019 demurrer to the SAC was filed on March 9, 2012. Accordingly, the demurrer was timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-5\">Carlton asserts the 10-day rule period applies when a complaint is amended following a demurrer, while the statute\u2019s 30-day period applies when a plaintiff elects to amend \u201cin due course.\u201d Carlton\u2019s interpretation of the statute is problematic because the statute is not limited to particular situations. The plain language of the statute reflects that it applies when \u201cthe complaint is amended.\u201d (\u00a7 471.5, subd. (a).) The statute takes precedence over the rule of court <em>(Pellegrini v. Weiss </em>(2008) 165 Cal.App.4th 515, 533 [81 Cal.Rptr.3d 387]), which explains why the rule of court cannot apply when an amended complaint is filed \u2014 the statute\u2019s 30-day rule has precedence. Thus, the rule only applies when an amended complaint is <em>not filed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1006-6\">B. <em>Breach of Contract</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1006-7\">Carlton contends the trial court erred by sustaining the demurrer as to the breach of contract cause of action in the SAC because the trial court overruled the demurrer to the breach of contract cause of action in the FAC, and no changes were made to the cause of action in the SAC.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-8\">Dr. Pepper asserts Carlton forfeited this issue by failing to raise it in the trial court. Our review of the record reflects Carlton did raise the issue in the trial court, and therefore the contention is not forfeited. Specifically, Foroozandeh said, \u201c[T]he demurrer was overruled as to the second cause of action, breach of contract. Nothing has changed since then. So the Court has already ruled on that then.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-9\">In a prior opinion, this court, quoting another appellate court, wrote, \u201c. . . \u2018The interests of all parties are advanced by avoiding a trial and reversal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1211\">*1211</page-number>for defect in pleadings. The objecting party is acting properly in raising the point at his first opportunity, by general demurrer. If the demurrer is erroneously overruled, he is acting properly in raising the point again, at his next opportunity. If the trial judge made the former ruling himself, he is not bound by it. [Citation.] And, if the demurrer was overruled by a different judge, the trial judge is equally free to reexamine the sufficiency of the pleading. [Citations.]\u2019 <em>(Ion Equipment Corp. </em>v. <em>Nelson </em>(1980) 110 Cal.App.3d 868, 877 [168 Cal.Rptr. 361] [First Dist., Div.

Two].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-5\">The Sixth District Court of Appeal has also concluded, \u201c[A] party is within its rights to successively demur to a cause of action in an amended pleading notwithstanding a prior unsuccessful demurrer to that same cause of action. <em>(Pavicich </em>v. <em>Santucci </em>(2000) 85 Cal.App.4th 382, 389 [102 Cal.Rptr.2d 125].)\u201d <em>(Berg &amp; Berg Enterprises, LLC v. Boyle </em>(2009) 178 Cal.App.4th 1020, 1036 [100 Cal.Rptr.3d 875].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-6\">Given the foregoing reasoning and rules from this court and others, the trial court could properly consider the demurrer to the entire SAC. When Carlton filed the SAC, he exposed himself to the possibility of a demurrer being filed and sustained to the entire SAC. Accordingly, we conclude the trial court did not err by sustaining the demurrer to the breach of contract cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-7\">Carlton cites the motion for reconsideration statute (\u00a7 1008) and asserts a motion for reconsideration was defendants\u2019 exclusive path to have the trial court again consider a demurrer to the breach of contract cause of action. We would agree with Carlton, if he had not filed the SAC. However, by filing the SAC, Carlton opened the door to a demurrer to the entire SAC, including the breach of contract cause of action. The SAC superseded the FAC, which permitted a demurrer to the entire SAC to be filed. (See <em>Meyer </em>v. <em>State Board of Equalization </em>(1954) 42 Cal.2d 376, 384 [267 P.2d 257] [\u201cIt is well established that an amendatory pleading supersedes the original one, which ceases to perform any function as a pleading.\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-8\">C., D.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1008-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1212\">*1212</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-4\">The award of discovery sanctions is reversed.
