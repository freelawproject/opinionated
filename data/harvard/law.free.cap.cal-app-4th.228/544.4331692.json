INTRODUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">A jury found defendant and appellant Christopher London guilty as charged of cultivating marijuana and possessing marijuana for sale. (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 11358 [cultivation], count 1, 11359 [possession for sale], count 2.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Defendant was sentenced to three years\u2019 probation, subject to terms and conditions including that he serve 60 days in jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">At trial, defendant claimed he was lawfully growing 100 marijuana plants for a medical marijuana collective under the Compassionate Use Act of 1996 (the CUA) (\u00a7 11362.5) and the Medical Marijuana Program Act (the MMPA) (\u00a7 11362.7 et seq.), and was therefore not guilty of unlawful marijuana cultivation (\u00a7 11358), possession for sale (\u00a7 11359), or the lesser included offense of marijuana possession (\u00a7 11357).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-9\">In the nonpublished portion of this opinion, we reject defendant\u2019s claims that the court erroneously denied his motion to suppression evidence of his 100 marijuana plants and his motion to exclude <em>xmMirandized</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>statements he made to police officers. In the published portion, we address defendant\u2019s claims of evidentiary and instructional error concerning his lawful cultivation defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-10\">We first address defendant\u2019s claim that the court erroneously refused to allow his cannabis expert, William Britt, to give opinion testimony critical to his lawful cultivation defense, including that defendant was lawfully cultivating the marijuana under the MMPA and that a $20,000 sum he expected to be paid for his 100 marijuana plants, when fully grown, did not include an unlawful profit. (\u00a7 11362.765, subd. (a) [MMPA does not allow cultivation or distribution of marijuana for profit].) We conclude the expert\u2019s testimony on these and other points was properly excluded because the expert lacked sufficient evidence to render the opinions. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 801, subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b464-11\">We then address defendant\u2019s additional claim that the court erroneously instructed the jury on his lawful cultivation defense under the MMPA. (\u00a7\u00a7 11362.765, 11362.775.) We agree the instructions misstated the applicable law under the MMPA, but conclude defendant did not produce sufficient evidence to raise a reasonable doubt he was lawfully growing the 100 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>marijuana plants for himself and other qualified patients, and was not earning a profit. Accordingly, there was insufficient evidence to support instructing the jury on defendant\u2019s MMPA defense. We therefore affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">II. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">A. <em>Prosecution Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">Around 1:00 a.m. on June 11, 2010, Fontana Police Officer Casey Mutter went to a house in Fontana to investigate a report of an elderly woman in the front yard calling for help. He found an elderly woman standing in the driveway with the garage door open, claiming her son, defendant, was holding her \u201cprisoner\u201d inside the house. After speaking to defendant inside the house, Officer Mutter determined the woman was suffering from dementia and took her into custody pursuant to Welfare and Institutions Code section 5150.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">Officer Mutter noticed an odor of marijuana as he went into the house through the pedestrian door inside the garage. Inside the house he found defendant asleep on a bed in a bedroom. As he woke defendant, he noticed a small amount of marijuana in a baggie on the bed and asked defendant where he got the marijuana. Defendant said the marijuana was his, he was growing marijuana in a room in the house, and pointed to a large black tarp covering the entryway to the grow room. Defendant showed Officer Mutter the marijuana plants, along with some \u201cpaperwork\u201d that was attached to the wall next to the tarp. He claimed the paperwork showed he was lawfully cultivating the marijuana for a medical marijuana collective in Malibu called the Green Galleon.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-9\">Officer Mutter contacted the narcotics unit, and Officer Joshua Rice, a narcotics officer, came to the house with two other officers. Officer Rice smelled marijuana in the area in front of the house. Inside the garage, he noticed duct tubing used for ventilation going into the walls of the house and a \u201cvery strong[]\u201d odor of marijuana coming through the duct tubing. In the grow room, he saw around 100 marijuana plants growing under seven metal lampshades with 1,000-watt lightbulbs, powered by numerous electrical cords.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-10\">Officer Rice sat down with defendant in the living room and spoke to him about the marijuana plants. Defendant explained he was growing the plants for the Green Galleon collective because he was having financial problems and needed to make money. He was living with and caring for his elderly mother who was on the verge of losing the house to foreclosure, he needed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>provide for his ex-wife and daughter, and \u201cjust have a better lifestyle.\u201d He had spoken with his cousin, Paul Miller, about his financial problems, and Miller took him to the Green Galleon collective in Malibu. He later signed the \u201cpaperwork\u201d to become part of the collective. Someone from the collective gave him 100 immature or \u201cclone\u201d marijuana plants and told him he would be paid $20,000 if he returned the plants, fully grown, to the collective. He would be also reimbursed for his costs and expenses incurred in growing the plants, including his electricity bills, which he estimated would total around $4,000. He was planning to reinvest some of his $20,000 \u201cprofit\u201d in larger grows to make larger profits. He gave his paperwork from the collective to Officer Rice, along with his physician\u2019s recommendation to use marijuana and his medical marijuana identification card.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Officer Rice testified that in his opinion defendant possessed the 100 marijuana plants for sale because he \u201cwas going to hand over 100 plants for $20,000.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">B. <em>Defendant\u2019s Testimony</em></p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">In his defense, defendant testified he was growing the marijuana plants for himself and other patient-members of the Green Galleon collective. His residence was in Malibu, but he lived with his elderly mother in Fontana during most of the week and was her full-time caretaker. Five people comprised the Green Galleon collective: himself, his mother, his roommate Victor Tamayo, his cousin Paul Miller, and a man named Brian, whose last name he did not know.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">After defendant told Miller he was having financial difficulties, Miller advised him he could make money growing marijuana \u201cover a period of time.\u201d Miller provided him with 100 \u201cclone\u201d or \u201cinfant\u201d marijuana plants, and he set up the indoor growing operation in his mother\u2019s Fontana house. The 100 plants were his first \u201cgrow\u201d for a medical marijuana collective, but he had grown marijuana \u201cfor other people\u201d in Humboldt County, among other places, during the 1970\u2019s and 1980\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">Miller was the only person from the Green Galleon collective with whom defendant had spoken concerning his growing operation. His role as a \u201cbud tender\u201d for the collective was to grow the plants to maturity and return them to Miller, who was to distribute them among the members of the collective and the original suppliers of the plants. Miller and Tamayo sometimes helped defendant with his growing operation by watering the plants and turning the grow lights on and off when defendant was not at his mother\u2019s house in Fontana.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>In total, defendant had invested $10,000 in his growing operation. He did not recall telling the officers he was going to make a \u201cpure profit\u201d of $20,000 from growing the 100 marijuana plants and handing them over to Miller. He expected to be reimbursed for his costs of growing the plants and his labor, or time and effort involved in growing the plants, and he saw himself as an employee of the collective. He was cultivating the marijuana to become financially solvent and understood he would make his $10,000 investment back over time and several medical marijuana grows. Britt\u2019s expert testimony is discussed below.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">III. ANALYSIS/THE PRETRIAL MOTIONS<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">IV. ANALYSIS/MMPA ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"AAl\">A. <em>Summary of California\u2019s Medical Marijuana Laws</em></p>\n<p id=\"ATh\">1. <em>The CUA</em></p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">In the November 1996 general election, California voters passed Proposition 215, an initiative statute titled Medical Use of Marijuana. The measure added section 11362.5, the Compassionate Use Act of 1996, to the Health and Safety Code. <em>(People v. Mower </em>(2002) 28 Cal.4th 457, 463 [122 Cal.Rptr.2d 326, 49 P.3d 1067]; \u00a7 11362.5, subd. (a).) The CUA grants patients and their primary caregivers limited immunity from state criminal prosecution, including a defense at trial, for two marijuana-related offenses: possession (\u00a7 11357) and cultivation (\u00a7 11358). <em>(People v. Mower, supra, </em>at pp. 470, 474; <em>People ex rel. Lungren v. Peron </em>(1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 1383, 1392 [70 Cal.Rptr.2d 20] <em>(Peron).) </em>The CUA provides: \u201cSection 11357, relating to the possession of marijuana, and Section 11358, relating to the cultivation of marijuana, shall not apply to a patient, or to a patient\u2019s primary caregiver, who possesses or cultivates marijuana for the personal medical purposes of the patient upon the written or oral recommendation or approval of a physician.\u201d (\u00a7 11362.5, subd. (d).)</p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">The CUA\u2019s limited immunity from state criminal prosecution for unlawful marijuana possession and cultivation applies <em>solely </em>to qualified patients and their primary caregivers who possess or cultivate marijuana for <em>the patient\u2019s </em>personal use. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Mower, supra, </em>28 Cal.4th at pp. 474-475.) As one court has explained, the CUA is a <em>\u201cnarrowly drafted </em>statute designed to allow a qualified patient and his or her primary caregiver <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>to possess and cultivate marijuana for <em>the patient\u2019s </em>personal use . . . .\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Urziceanu </em>(2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 747, 772-773 [33 Cal.Rptr.3d 859], italics added <em>(Urziceanu).) </em> The court reasoned: \u201cThe use of the singular identifying the patient and primary caregiver as the person privileged to engage in the identified conduct and the term \u2018personal medical purposes\u2019 suggests the Compassionate Use Act was designed for a single patient to grow or possess his or her own marijuana, or to have that marijuana possessed or grown for him or her by his or her caregiver. While a primary caregiver could care for and cultivate more than one patient\u2019s marijuana, this language lends no support to [the] contention that \u2018patients\u2019 and their \u2018caregivers\u2019 can collectively pool talents, efforts, and money to create a stockpile of marijuana that is to be collectively distributed.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 768.)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">2. <em>The MMPA</em></p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">In 2003, the Legislature enacted the MMPA (\u00a7 11362.7 et seq.) in response to the CUA\u2019s stated purpose, among others, to \u201cencourage the federal and state governments to implement a plan to provide for the safe and affordable distribution of marijuana to all patients in medical need of marijuana.\u201d (\u00a7 11362.5, subd. (b)(1)(C); see <em>Urziceanu, supra, </em>132 Cal.App.4th at pp. 782-783.) The MMPA did not amend the CUA; it is a separate legislative scheme that implements the CUA. <em>(People v. Hochanadel </em>(2009) 176 Cal.App.4th 997, 1012-1013 [98 Cal.Rptr.3d 347]; <em>County of San Diego </em>v. <em>San Diego NORML </em>(2008) 165 Cal.App.4th 798, 829-831 [81 Cal.Rptr.3d 461].)</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">The MMPA \u201cexpressly expands the scope of the [CUA] beyond the qualified defense to cultivation and possession of marijuana\u201d to possession of marijuana for sale (\u00a7 11359) among other offenses. <em>(Urziceanu, supra, </em>132 Cal.App.4th at p. 784.) In contrast to the more restrictive CUA, the MMPA \u201ccontemplates the formation and operation of medicinal marijuana cooperatives that would receive reimbursement for marijuana and the services provided in conjunction with the provision of that marijuana.\u201d <em>(Urziceanu, </em>at p. 785; see \u00a7\u00a7 11362.765, 11362.775.) The MMPA \u201cabrogate[d]\u201d pre-MMPA case law, including <em>Peron, supra, </em>59 Cal.App.4th 1383, to the extent that case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>law \u201ctook a [more] restrictive view\u201d of the activities allowed by the CUA than the MMPA. (Urziceanu, supra, at p. 785.)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">The MMPA seeks to \u201c[e]nhance the access of patients and caregivers to medical marijuana through collective, cooperative cultivation projects.\u201d (Stats. 2003, ch. 875, \u00a7 1(b)(3), pp. 6422-6423.) To this end, section 11362.775, part of the MMPA, provides: \u201cQualified patients, persons with valid identification cards, and the designated primary caregivers of qualified patients and persons with identification cards, who associate within the State of California in order collectively or cooperatively to cultivate marijuana for medical purposes, shall not solely on the basis of that fact be subject to state criminal sanctions under Section 11357 [(possession of marijuana)], 11358 [(cultivation)], 11359 [(possession for sale)], 11360 [(transportation)], 11366 [(maintaining a place for the sale, giving away or use of marijuana)], 11366.5 [(making available premises for the manufacture, storage or distribution of controlled substances)], or 11570 [(abatement of nuisance created by premises used for manufacture, storage or distribution of controlled substances)].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">The MMPA defines a \u201cqualified patient\u201d as \u201ca person who is entitled to the protections of [the CUA] but who does not have an identification card\u201d issued pursuant to the MMPA. (\u00a7 11362.7, subd. (f).) The MMPA contains guidelines limiting the amount of \u201cdried marijuana\u201d a qualified patient or qualified primary caregiver may possess and the number of \u201cmature\u201d and \u201cimmature\u201d plants these persons may maintain or cultivate for the qualified patient (\u00a7 11362.77, subd. (a)) but, as applied, these limits cannot be less than the amount of marijuana necessary to meet the qualified patient\u2019s current medical needs. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Kelly, supra, </em>47 Cal.4th at pp. 1043-1049.)</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">The MMPA does not allow qualified patients, valid identification cardholders, or their primary caregivers to earn a profit from the cultivation or distribution of medical marijuana, whether through a cooperative, collective, or otherwise. Section 11362.765 states: \u201c(a) Subject to the requirements of this article, the individuals specified in subdivision (b) shall not be subject, on that sole basis, to criminal liability under Section 11357, 11358, 11359, 11360, 11366, 11366.5 or 11570. However, nothing in this section shall authorize the individual to smoke or otherwise consume marijuana unless otherwise authorized by this article, <em>nor shall anything in this section </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number><em>authorize any individual or group to cultivate or distribute marijuana for </em>profit.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>subd. (a), italics added.)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">Together, sections 11362.765 and 11362.775, part of the MMPA, plainly allow qualified patients, valid identification cardholders, and their primary caregivers to pool their efforts and resources to cultivate marijuana for the qualified patients and holders of valid identification cards, in amounts necessary to meet the reasonable medical needs of the qualified patients and cardholders \u2014 without being subject to criminal sanctions for, among other offenses, unlawful marijuana possession (\u00a7 11357), cultivation (\u00a7 11358), or possession for sale (\u00a7 11359) \u2014 provided they do not earn a profit from the cultivation, distribution, or sale of the medical marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">3. <em>The Guidelines</em></p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">Section 11362.81, subdivision (d), part of the MMPA, directs the California Attorney General to \u201cdevelop and adopt appropriate guidelines to ensure the security and nondiversion of marijuana grown for medical use by patients qualified under the [CUA].\u201d In 2008, the California Attorney General, Edmund G. Brown, Jr., issued the Guidelines for the Security and Non-Diversion of Marijuana Grown for Medical Use (Guidelines). The Guidelines are not binding on the courts but are entitled to \u201cconsiderable weight.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Colvin </em>(2012) 203 Cal.App.4th 1029, 1040, fn. 11 [137 Cal.Rptr.3d 856]; see <em>People v. Hochanadel, supra, </em>176 Cal.App.4th at p. 1011.)</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">The Guidelines are intended to serve several purposes: \u201c(1) ensure that marijuana grown for medical purposes remains secure and does not find its way to non-patients or illicit markets, (2) help law enforcement agencies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>perform their duties effectively and in accordance with California law, and (3) <em>help patients and primary caregivers understand how they may cultivate, transport, possess, and use medical marijuana under California law.\u201d </em>(Guidelines, p. 1, italics added.) The Guidelines observe: \u201cUnder California law, medical marijuana patients and primary caregivers may \u2018associate within the State of California in order collectively or cooperatively to cultivate marijuana for medical purposes.\u2019 (\u00a7 11362.775.)\u201d (Guidelines, \u00a7 IV, p. 8.)</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">In order to help cooperatives and collectives operate within the law, the Guidelines require that \u201c[a]ny group that is collectively or cooperatively cultivating and distributing marijuana for medical purposes should be organized and operated in a manner that ensures the security of the crop and safeguards against diversion for non-medical purposes.\u201d (Guidelines, \u00a7 IV.A., p. 8.) A group organized as a nonprofit, agricultural cooperative must comply with applicable provisions of the Corporations Code and the Food and Agricultural Code. For example, the group must \u201cfile articles of incorporation with the state and conduct its business for the mutual benefit of its members.\u201d (Guidelines, \u00a7 IV.A.1., p. 8.)</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">Regarding collectives, which unlike cooperatives are neither statutorily defined nor governed by statute, the Guidelines state: \u201cCalifornia law does not define collectives, but the dictionary defines them as \u2018a business, farm, etc., jointly owned and operated by the members of a group. \u2019 [Citation.] Applying this definition, a collective should be an organization that merely facilitates the collaborative efforts of patient and caregiver members\u2014 including the allocation of costs and revenues. As such, a collective is not a statutory entity, but as a practical matter it might have to organize as some form of business to carry out its activities. The collective should not purchase marijuana from, or sell to, non-members; instead, it should only provide a means for facilitating or coordinating transactions between members.\u201d (Guidelines, \u00a7 IV.A.2., p. 8.) Cooperatives and collectives must be \u201cNonProfit Operation[s]\u201d (Guidelines, \u00a7 IV.B.l, p. 9) and \u201cshould acquire marijuana only from their constituent members, because only marijuana grown by a qualified patient or his or her primary caregiver may lawfully be transported by, or distributed to, other members of a collective or cooperative (\u00a7\u00a7 11362.765, 11362.775). <em>The collective or cooperative may then allocate it to other members of the group. </em>Nothing allows marijuana to be purchased from outside the collective or cooperative for distribution to its members. Instead, the cycle should be a closed-circuit of marijuana cultivation and consumption with no purchases or sales to or from non-members. To help prevent diversion of medical marijuana to non-medical markets, <em>collectives and cooperatives should document each member\u2019s contribution of labor, resources, or money to the enterprise. They should also track and record the source of their marijuana.\u201d </em>(Guidelines, \u00a7 IV.B.4., p. 10, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b472-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>In accordance with section 11362.765, part of the MMPA, the Guidelines provide that medical marijuana grown at a collective or cooperative may be \u201ca) Provided free to qualified patients and primary caregivers who are members of the collective or cooperative; [\u00b6] b) Provided in exchange for services rendered to the entity; [|] c) Allocated based on fees that are reasonably calculated to cover <em>overhead costs and operating expenses', </em>or [][] d) Any combination of the above.\u201d (Guidelines, \u00a7 IV.B.6., p. 10, italics added.) Thus, \u201c \u2018[a]ny monetary reimbursement that members provide to the collective or cooperative should only be an amount necessary to cover overhead costs and operating expenses.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v. Hochanadel, supra, </em>176 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1010-1011.)</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">B. <em>The Expert Testimony of the Defense Cannabis Expert Was Properly Limited</em></p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">1. <em>Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">William Britt was the executive director of the Association of Patient Advocates, a grassroots organization he formed 15 years earlier to help persons with mental and physical disabilities gain access to services and alternative treatments. He had a high school education and \u201csome training\u201d and experience in accounting, but no medical, legal, or horticultural degrees. He had spoken about medical marijuana to medical professionals, law enforcement agencies, city councils, and other groups, and had testified as a cannabis expert over 50 times in Los Angeles County. He was the only cannabis expert whom the Los Angeles County Superior Court considered qualified to be appointed to assist indigent criminal defendants in Los Angeles County. He had testified as an expert on the particular issue of \u201ccompensation to growers\u201d \u201cat least 20, 30 times,\u201d and he was a medical marijuana patient himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">The prosecution moved in limine to prevent Britt from testifying about the indicia of lawfully operating medical marijuana collectives, their costs of cultivating marijuana, and their methods of compensating their members for cultivation services performed for the collective. At an Evidence Code section 402 hearing, Britt testified there were \u201c[a]t least a thousand\u201d medical marijuana collectives in California. When asked how a medical marijuana collective differs from a cooperative, if at all, Britt responded that cooperatives are legally defined entities; they must have a board of directors and must operate in accordance with certain rules. In contrast, collectives are not legally defined, are \u201cgenerally more loosely operated\u201d than cooperatives, and \u201cone collective can be very different than another collective.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">Britt had heard of the Green Galleon collective in Malibu through advertisements and through speaking to medical marijuana patients who may have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>been members of the collective, but he knew nothing about its methods of operation. He did not know who ran the collective, how many members it had, how the labor of running the collective was divided among its members, or where or how the collective obtained its marijuana. His understanding of defendant\u2019s relationship with the collective was based entirely on defendant\u2019s representations; he had not spoken to anyone at the collective to verify defendant\u2019s membership or relationship with the collective. Britt agreed that, due to his lack of knowledge about the Green Galleon\u2019s methods of operation, he could not offer an opinion whether it was operating as a lawful medical marijuana collective or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">At the hearing on the in limine motion, defendant argued his lawful cultivation defense was based on \u201chow collectives operative\u201d and \u201c[w]hether or not services are reimbursed.\u201d Relying on <em>Urziceanu, supra, </em>132 Cal.App.4th 747, he argued the law allowed him to cultivate marijuana as a member of a collective and receive reasonable compensation for his services. The trial court took a restrictive view of the permissible scope of Britt\u2019s testimony, and ruled he could not testify \u201cregarding any salary or reimbursement for participating as a marijuana grower or a collective . . . .\u201d Relying on a pre-MMPA case, <em>Per\u00f3n, supra, </em>59 Cal.App.4th 1383, the court ruled the subjects of \u201ccompensation or salary, reimbursement\u201d to members of a marijuana collective were \u201coff the table\u201d because the law prohibited the sale or possession for sale of marijuana \u201ceven as a nonprofit organization.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">As additional support for its ruling, the court noted there appeared to be \u201cno set rules\u201d governing how medical marijuana collectives could lawfully operate, and a \u201cgreat variance\u201d in the ways collectives operated. But the court found even \u201cmore troubling\u201d Britt\u2019s admission that he lacked information concerning the Green Galleon\u2019s methods of operation and consequent inability to opine whether the collective was lawfully operating under California\u2019s medical marijuana laws. Given Britt\u2019s lack of information about the Green Galleon\u2019s methods of operation, the prosecutor argued Britt would \u201cspeculate wildly\u201d about whether defendant was lawfully cultivating marijuana for the collective. The court agreed, saying: \u201cI don\u2019t know how [Britt] can possibly opine what specifics may have been related to their setup, their operation, their labor, their numbers, their members, those types of things.\u201d Based on his other qualifications, the court ruled Britt could testify whether there were any indications defendant was selling marijuana or possessed the 100 marijuana plants for sale. The court also ruled Britt could testify \u201cas a patient advocate\u201d concerning defendant\u2019s personal use of marijuana as a \u201cpain management\u201d strategy, if a proper foundation were laid for that testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">In his subsequent testimony before the jury, Britt indicated his knowledge of compensation and reimbursement for expenses incurred in cultivating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>medical marijuana was based on his interviews of \u201chundreds if not thousands\u201d of medical marijuana patients concerning how, why, and when they used marijuana, and how they cultivated marijuana. He had \u201cvisited numerous cultivation sites and collectives,\u201d and had consulted with attorneys, mostly defense attorneys.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">The court sustained numerous prosecution objections and refused to allow Britt to testify concerning compensation lawfully paid to and expenses reasonably incurred by persons who grow marijuana for medical marijuana collectives. The court also ruled Britt did not lay a sufficient evidentiary foundation to opine that the 100 marijuana plants defendant was growing would produce no more marijuana than necessary to supply the needs of a collective comprised of six medical marijuana patients. Nor was he qualified to render any legal opinions, including on the legal distinctions between unlawful and lawful marijuana cultivations. The court clarified: \u201cIf he wants to testify to his own personal use, if he wants to testify, again, as to being a patient advocate with respect to his personal knowledge about [defendant] and his purported use, he can go there. But he is not to testify about these other issues that call for legal opinions on areas that are outside and not relevant to our concern.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">Britt later testified that an average medical marijuana patient consumes about three to six pounds of marijuana per year, and a collective would therefore need to produce 18 to 36 pounds of marijuana per year to supply marijuana for six members. When asked how much usable marijuana defendant\u2019s 100 marijuana plants would likely produce, Britt testified that would be hard to determine because the yield from indoor-grown plants depends greatly on the quantity and quality of the indoor lighting the plants receive. Finally, Britt testified that in his experience it typically costs $3,000 to produce one pound of marijuana, and the initial cost to establish a \u201cseven-light grow setup\u201d such as defendant\u2019s would be around $7,000 to $10,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">2. <em>Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">Defendant claims the court\u2019s limitations on Britt\u2019s expert testimony deprived him of his due process right to present critical evidence on his lawful cultivation defense. \u201cUnder the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, criminal prosecutions must comport with prevailing notions of fundamental fairness.\u201d <em>(California v. Trombetta </em>(1984) 467 U.S. 479, 485 [81 L.Ed.2d 413, 104 S.Ct. 2528].) This means that states must afford a defendant \u201ca meaningful opportunity to present a complete defense\u201d to criminal charges. <em>(Ibid.) </em>A defendant is denied that opportunity when the state is permitted \u201c \u2018to exclude competent, reliable evidence . . . when such evidence is central to the defendant\u2019s claim of innocence,\u2019 \u201d absent a valid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>justification for excluding the evidence. <em>(Montana v. Egelhoff </em>(1996) 518 U.S. 37, 53 [135 L.Ed.2d 361, 116 S.Ct. 2013], quoting <em>Crane </em>v. <em>Kentucky </em>(1986) 476 U.S. 683, 690 [90 L.Ed.2d 636, 106 S.Ct. 2142].)</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">But here, defendant does not identify what testimony Britt could have <em>competently </em>given but was precluded from giving concerning his lawful cultivation defense. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 801, subd. (b) [expert opinion testimony is limited to opinion based on matter perceived by, personally known to, or made known to the expert at or before the hearing].) Britt admitted he knew nothing about the Green Galleon collective\u2019s methods of operation, who ran it, how many members it had, how the labor of running it was divided among its members, or how its members obtained marijuana. Britt had not spoken to anyone at the collective to verify defendant\u2019s membership in it or relationship with it. Given his lack of personal knowledge or other information concerning its operations, Britt agreed he could not competently opine that the Green Galleon collective was lawfully operating as a medical marijuana collective under the MMPA. (See Evid. Code, \u00a7 801, subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">In addition, Britt lacked a sufficient evidentiary foundation to opine that defendant was not earning an unlawful profit for cultivating the 100 marijuana plants for the collective. (\u00a7 11362.765, subd. (a) [persons may not profit from sale or distribution of medical marijuana]; Guidelines, \u00a7 IV.B.6., p. 10 [medical marijuana may be allocated among members of medical marijuana collective or cooperative \u201cbased on fees that are reasonably calculated to cover overhead costs and operating expenses\u201d].) Defendant\u2019s statements to the officers and trial testimony did not provide the necessary evidentiary foundation.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">Though defendant denied telling Officer Rice he expected to earn a $20,000 \u201cpure profit\u201d from his 100-plant marijuana grow, and he only expected to make money growing marijuana \u201cover a period of time,\u201d he never explained how much he expected to earn from his 100-plant grow and any additional \u201cgrows\u201d for the collective. Nor did he estimate the amount of time and effort he had invested and expected to invest in his 100-plant grow and in his planned additional grows, or tie that amount of time and effort to the amount of compensation he expected to earn for cultivating marijuana for his collective. (Guidelines, \u00a7 IV.B.4., p. 10 [\u201ccollectives and cooperatives should document each member\u2019s contribution of labor, resources, or money to the enterprise\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b475-8\">To be sure, defendant estimated he had invested $10,000 in his lights and other growing equipment and he testified he expected to be reimbursed for that amount and his other out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in growing the marijuana (e.g., his electricity bills), <em>in addition </em>to being paid for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>the marijuana plants he was growing. But there was no evidence tying the reasonable value of defendant\u2019s cultivation services to the amount of compensation he expected to be paid for his marijuana plants. Accordingly, there was no evidentiary basis for Britt to opine defendant was not earning an unlawful profit for cultivating and distributing \u2014 i.e., selling \u2014 his marijuana plants to the collective. By the same token, Britt had no evidentiary basis to opine that the $20,000 defendant told Officer Rice he expected to be paid for his 100 plants, when fully grown, plus his out-of-pocket costs incurred in growing the plants, was reasonably calculated to cover no more than his \u201coverhead costs and operating expenses,\u201d including the reasonable value of his labor and services rendered in cultivating the plants. (Guidelines, \u00a7 IV.B.6., p. 10.)</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">Britt also lacked a sufficient evidentiary foundation to opine that the 100 plants defendant was currently cultivating would produce no more marijuana than necessary to supply the current medical needs of a collective comprised of six qualified patients, including defendant. (\u00a7 11362.77; <em>People </em>v. <em>Kelly, supra, </em>47 Cal.4th at p. 1049.) Although Britt testified an average medical marijuana patient consumes three to six pounds of marijuana per year, and a collective comprised of six qualified patients would need 18 to 36 pounds of marijuana per year, he could not estimate how much marijuana defendant\u2019s 100 plants would produce. He said the yield from indoor-grown plants depends greatly on the quantity and quality of indoor lighting the plants receive, and he had no evidence about the quantity or quality of lighting the 100 plants were receiving. Thus, by his own admission, Britt could not reasonably estimate the amount of marijuana defendant\u2019s 100 plants would produce, or whether that amount exceeded 18 to 36 pounds per year, the amount he indicated was necessary to meet the reasonable medical needs of six <em>average </em>qualified patients.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">Defendant criticizes the court\u2019s reliance on the pre-MMPA case, <em>Per\u00f3n, </em>in ruling Britt could not testify on the subjects of \u201ccompensation or salary, reimbursement\u201d to qualified patients of a medical marijuana collective in exchange for their services rendered and costs incurred in cultivating marijuana for the collective. <em>Per\u00f3n </em>correctly pointed out that <em>the CUA </em>does not allow marijuana to be sold, even \u201con an allegedly nonprofit basis.\u201d <em>(Peron, supra, </em>59 Cal.App.4th at p. 1392.) Still, we agree the court\u2019s reliance on <em>Per\u00f3n </em>was misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>The MMPA abrogated <em>Peron </em>and other pre-MMPA cases to the extent the cases construed the CUA more restrictively than the subsequently enacted MMPA allows. <em>(Urziceanu, supra, </em>132 Cal.App.4th at p. 785.) The MMPA and the Guidelines allow nonprofit groups comprised of qualified patients, valid medical marijuana identification cardholders, and their respective primary caregivers, if any, <em>to pay each other and receive compensation and reimbursement from each other </em>in amounts necessary to cover the \u201coverhead costs and operating expenses\u201d incurred in cultivating and providing medical marijuana to qualified patient members of the group. (Guidelines, \u00a7 IV.B.6, p. 10; see \u00a7\u00a7 11362.765, 11362.775.)</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">As defendant points out, appellate court decisions issued following his August 2012 trial have acknowledged, at least implicitly, that the MMPA and the Guidelines allow qualified patients and persons holding valid identification cards to be paid reasonable compensation for cultivating marijuana for other qualified patients. (See, e.g., <em>People v. Jackson </em>(2012) 210 Cal.App.4th 525, 537 [148 Cal.Rptr.3d 375] [the Guidelines \u201cappear to contemplate that collectives and cooperatives will dispense [(i.e., sell)] marijuana and that there will be an exchange of cash consideration\u201d]; <em>People ex rel.

Colvin, supra, </em>203 Cal.App.4th at p. 1039 [not all members of medical marijuana cooperative or collective must participate in cultivating marijuana for other members].)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">Nevertheless, <em>Jackson, Colvin, </em>and <em>Holistic Health </em>do not assist defendant\u2019s claim that the court erroneously limited Britt\u2019s expert testimony. Notwithstanding its misplaced reliance on <em>Peron, </em>the court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to allow Britt to offer his expert opinion that defendant was only earning reasonable compensation and was not earning an unlawful profit on his 100-plant medical marijuana grow. <em>(People v. Gutierrez </em>(2009) 45 Cal.4th 789, 828 [89 Cal.Rptr.3d 225, 200 P.3d 847] [court\u2019s decision to exclude evidence is reviewed for an abuse of discretion]; <em>Lent v.

As discussed, Britt had no evidentiary foundation to offer that opinion, and he admitted he could not competently opine that the Green Galleon collective was lawfully operating under state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">C. <em>Insufficient Evidence Supported Defendant\u2019s Lawful Cultivation Defense</em></p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">Defendant claims he was denied a fair trial because the court misinstructed the jury on his lawful cultivation defense under the MMPA. We agree the instructions did not accurately state the law applicable to defendant\u2019s defense that he was lawfully cultivating marijuana under the MMPA. Nevertheless, the erroneous instructions were not prejudicial because the evidence was insufficient to raise a reasonable doubt that defendant was not earning a profit on his medical marijuana cultivation operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">1. <em>The Relevant Instructions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">The jury was instructed that unlawful possession of marijuana (\u00a7 11357) was a lesser included offense of the unlawful cultivation (\u00a7 11358) and possession for sale (\u00a7 11359) charged in counts 1 and 2, respectively. In substantially similar language, the jury was instructed on how defendant\u2019s lawful cultivation defense applied to the unlawful cultivation and possession for sale charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">On how the lawful cultivation defense applied to the unlawful cultivation charge in count 1, the jury was instructed: \u201cPossession or cultivation of marijuana is lawful if authorized by the [CUA], The [CUA] allows a person to possess or cultivate marijuana (for personal medical purposes or as the primary caregiver of a patient with a medical need) when a physician has recommended or approved such use. The amount of marijuana possessed or cultivated must be reasonably related to the patient\u2019s current medical needs. The People have the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was not authorized to possess or cultivate marijuana for medical purposes. If the People have not met this burden, you must find the defendant not guilty of this crime. [\u00b6] A primary caregiver is someone who has consistently assumed responsibility for the housing, health, or safety of a patient who may legally possess or cultivate marijuana.\u201d (CALCRIM No. 2370.)</p>\n<p id=\"b478-9\">On how the lawful cultivation defense applied to the possession for sale charge in count 2, the jury was instructed: \u201cPossession of marijuana is lawful if authorized by the [CUA]. The [CUA] allows a person to possess marijuana for personal medical purposes or as the primary caregiver of a patient with a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>medical need when a physician has recommended or approved such use. The amount of marijuana possessed must be reasonably related to the patient\u2019s current medical needs. The People have the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was not authorized to possess the marijuana for medical purposes. If the People have not met this burden, you must find the defendant not guilty of this crime, [\u00b6] A primary caregiver is someone who has consistently assumed responsibility for the housing, health, or safety of a patient who may legally possess or cultivate marijuana.\u201d (CALCRIM No. 2375.)</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">The court further instructed the jury in the language of section 11362.775: \u201cQualified patients, persons with valid identification cards, and the designated primary caregivers of qualified patients and persons with identification cards, who associate within the State of California in order collectively or cooperatively to cultivate marijuana for medical purposes, shall not solely on the basis of that fact be subject to state criminal sanctions under Section 11357, 11358, 11359, 11360, 11366, 11366.5 or 11570. [\u00b6] You have heard evidence that the defendant possessed a valid medical marijuana recommendation from a physician. [][] Simple possession of marijuana is lawful under the [CUA] and the [MMPA] if a person has a valid physician\u2019s recommendation. <em>Possession for sale, and the actual sale of marijuana is not lawful even if a person has a valid medical marijuana recommendation from a physician, </em>[\u00b6] The People have the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant possessed marijuana with the intent to sell.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">The jury was further instructed on a mistake of fact defense: \u201cThe defendant is not guilty of possession for sale of marijuana if he did not have the intent or mental state required to commit the crime because he reasonably did not know a fact or reasonably and mistakenly believed a fact. [][] If the defendant\u2019s conduct would have been lawful under the facts as he reasonably believed them to be, he did not commit possession for sale of marijuana. If you find the defendant believed that he was being reimbursed by a co-op or a collective and if you find that belief was reasonable, he did not have the specific intent or mental state required for possession for sale of marijuana, [\u00b6] If you have a reasonable doubt about whether the defendant had the specific intent or mental state required for possession for sale of marijuana, you must find him not guilty of that crime.\u201d (CALCRIM No. 3406.)</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">2. <em>Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">We review a court\u2019s instructions de nova to determine whether they correctly state the law or effectively direct a finding adverse to the defendant by removing an issue from the jury\u2019s consideration. <em>(People v. Posey </em>(2004) 32 Cal.4th 193, 218 [8 Cal.Rptr.3d 551, 82 P.3d 755].) \u201cOur task is to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>determine whether the trial court ' \u201cfully and fairly instructed on the applicable law.\u201d [Citation.]\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People v. Lopez </em>(2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 698, 708 [129 Cal.Rptr.3d 583].) In determining whether the jury was fully and fairly instructed on the applicable law, we consider the instructions as a whole and each in light of the others. <em>(People v. Moore </em>(2011) 51 Cal.4th 1104, 1140 [127 Cal.Rptr.3d 2, 253 P.3d 1153].) We also consider the entire trial record, including the arguments of counsel, and assume the jurors understood and correlated all of the instructions. <em>(People v. Lopez, supra, </em>at p. 708.)</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">The instructions did not accurately state the law supporting defendant\u2019s lawful cultivation defense, essentially because the instructions were based on the CUA, not the MMPA. The CUA does not contemplate the lawful cultivation or sale of medical marijuana through nonprofit organizations. Instead, it allows a patient and his or her primary caregiver to grow or possess marijuana <em>solely </em>for <em>the patient\u2019s </em>medical purposes, <em>and for no other persons or groups of persons. (Urziceanu, supra, </em>132 Cal.App.4th at p. 768.) In contrast, the MMPA allows qualified patients, valid identification cardholders, and their respective primary caregivers, if any, to form nonprofit groups, and through those groups, pay <em>each other and receive compensation and reimbursement from each other </em>in amounts necessary to cover the \u201coverhead costs and operating expenses\u201d of cultivating and providing medical marijuana to the qualified patient and valid cardholder members of the group. (Guidelines, \u00a7 IV.B.6., p. 10; see \u00a7\u00a7 11362.765, 11362.775; <em>People v. Jackson, supra, </em>210 Cal.App.4th at p. 537 [MMPA does not limit number of qualified patient members a medical marijuana cooperative or collective may have]; <em>People v. Colvin, supra, </em>203 Cal.App.4th at p. 1039 [not all members of cooperative or collective must participate in cultivating marijuana for other members].)</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">The instructions erroneously told the jury that in order to find defendant was lawfully cultivating the 100 marijuana plants \u2014 and was therefore not guilty of unlawful cultivation (\u00a7 11358) or possession for sale (\u00a7 11359) \u2014 it had to find he was either the primary caregiver for the other alleged five members of the Green Galleon collective or was growing no more marijuana than necessary for his own medical use. In this respect, the instructions comported with the CUA but were contrary to the MMPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">The instructions also erroneously stated: <em>\u201cPossession for sale, and the actual sale of marijuana is not lawful even if a person has a valid medical marijuana recommendation from a physician.\u201d </em>(Italics added.) Though nothing in the MMPA allows any individual or group to cultivate or distribute marijuana for profit (\u00a7 11362.765, subd. (a)), the Guidelines allow marijuana grown through a nonprofit collective or cooperative to be \u201c[allocated based on fees that are reasonably calculated to cover overhead costs and operating expenses.\u201d (Guidelines, \u00a7 IV.B.6., p. 10; see \u00a7 11362.775.)</p>\n<p id=\"b481-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>Nothing in the other instructions or the arguments of counsel cured these instructional errors. Nonetheless, there was insufficient evidence to support defendant\u2019s lawful cultivation defense; thus, defendant was not entitled to instructions on the defense. When a defendant claims he or she was lawfully cultivating marijuana under the MMPA (\u00a7\u00a7 11362.765, 11362.775) as a defense to marijuana-related charges including unlawful cultivation (\u00a7 11358) and possession for sale (\u00a7 11359), the defendant has the burden of <em>producing evidence </em>sufficient to raise a reasonable doubt of his guilt. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Mower, supra, </em>28 Cal.4th at pp. 476-482; <em>People </em>v. <em>Jackson, supra, </em>210 Cal.App.4th at p. 533.)  The trial court is required to instruct sua sponte on a defense only if substantial evidence supports it, the defendant is relying on it, and it is consistent with the defendant\u2019s theory of the case. <em>(People v. Villanueva </em>(2008) 169 Cal.App.4th 41, 49 [86 Cal.Rptr.3d 534].)</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\"><em>People v. Solis </em>(2013) 217 Cal.App.4th 51 [158 Cal.Rptr.3d 34] is instructive. Solis and other defendants operated a 1,700-member medical marijuana dispensary, the Healing Center (THC), out of a storefront in Santa Barbara. THC was not registered as a nonprofit organization. Several of its customers reported they became members by filling out a form, and they had no involvement with the dispensary other than purchasing marijuana there. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 54.) In one year, Solis received $80,000 in income from THC and spent it on family expenses and entertainment. He purchased marijuana from unidentified sources and resold it to the dispensary for double the price he paid. Other venders also sold marijuana to THC, and Solis knew some of those vendors used false names to avoid \u201c \u2018legal problems.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 55.) Police tracked down one vendor who was not a member of the dispensary. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 54-55.)</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">The trial court rejected Solis\u2019s MMPA defense in a bench trial, finding there was insufficient evidence to raise a reasonable doubt whether THC was operating on a nonprofit basis. <em>(People v. Solis, supra, </em>217 Cal.App.4th at p. 56.) The court reasoned in part: \u201c \u2018Monetary reimbursement that members provide to [a] collective or cooperative is limited to an amount necessary to cover overhead costs and operating expenses. [(Guidelines, \u00a7 IV.B.6., p. 10.)] Defendants have provided no evidence of actual overhead costs or expenses that had to be reimbursed. Rather, the reimbursement amount or, as Solis described it, pricing was simply double the amount [THC] paid for [the] marijuana.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The trial court also found there was no evidence that THC members \u201c \u2018pooled money\u2019 \u201d to collectively grow marijuana, and no evidence that the monies paid to THC went into collective cultivation of marijuana. <em>(Ibid.) </em>To the contrary, the evidence showed the revenues went to vendors, many of whom were unknown and two of whom were not members of THC, and to Solis for his \u201c \u2018entertainment and living expenses.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b482-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>The trial court found Solis guilty of possessing marijuana for sale (\u00a7 11359) and a misdemeanor count of selling or transporting marijuana (\u00a7 11360, subd. (a); <em>People </em>v. <em>Solis, supra, </em>217 Cal.App.4th at p. 54). The appellate court agreed there was insufficient evidence to support Solis\u2019s MMPA defense that he was lawfully cultivating marijuana for a nonprofit collective, and affirmed the judgment. <em>(People v. Solis, supra, </em>at p. 59.)</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">Here, too, the evidence supporting defendant\u2019s lawful cultivation defense fell short of raising a reasonable doubt that defendant was lawfully cultivating and lawfully possessing marijuana for sale, on a nonprofit basis, to a lawfully operating marijuana collective. First, there was insufficient evidence that the Green Galleon collective was lawfully operating a nonprofit medical marijuana collective comprised solely of qualified patients, valid identification cardholders, or their primary caregivers. (\u00a7\u00a7 11362.765, 11362.775; Guidelines, \u00a7 IV, pp. 8-11.) With the exception of defendant, there was no evidence that any of the collective\u2019s other five members were qualified patients. (\u00a7 11362.7, subd. (f).) Nor was there any evidence that the collective was registered, organized, or operating as a nonprofit organization (see Guidelines, \u00a7 FV.A.2., p. 8) or that it was organized with sufficient structure to ensure nondiversion of marijuana to illicit markets (Guidelines, \u00a7 IV.B., pp. 9-11). Defendant testified that half of the marijuana he harvested from his 100-plant grow would be given to his cousin, Miller, the person from the collective who provided him with the 100 \u201cclone\u201d plants, but there was no evidence that <em>any </em>of the marijuana harvested from defendant\u2019s grow would be given for free or sold, on a nonprofit basis, <em>solely </em>to qualified patient members of the collective.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">Lastly, defendant asserts a \u201cclear and accurate instruction stating a medical marijuana patient is entitled to reimbursement an[d] compensation for cultivating for the collective was required.\u201d We disagree. Such an instruction would have been too broadly worded and therefore misleading, because it would not have limited the amount of permissible reimbursement to the amount of out-of-pocket costs incurred in cultivating the marijuana, nor would it have limited the amount of permissible compensation to the <em>reasonable value </em>of the cultivation services rendered. Under the MMPA, a qualified patient or valid identification cardholder is entitled to receive only <em>reasonable </em>compensation for his labor or services rendered in cultivating medical marijuana for other qualified patient members of his nonprofit group, plus reimbursement for his out-of-pocket expenses incurred, but he <em>may not earn a profit </em>from growing medical marijuana.

It appears from Britt\u2019s testimony that the collective had many more members, but there was no solid, reliable evidence that it did. Britt had only <em>heard of the </em>collective through advertisement and by speaking with persons he said <em>may have </em>been members, but he did not know how many members it had. Thus, the only competent evidence presented was that the collective was comprised of six persons, including defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b477-7\"> We agree with the observation in <em>People ex rel.

Nothing in section 11362.765 or the Guidelines indicates that <em>only primary caregivers </em>may receive reasonable compensation for cultivating marijuana for a nonprofit group of qualified medical marijuana patients. Rather, groups comprised solely of qualified patients may grow medical marijuana for each other, provided they do not earn a profit on their cultivation services rendered or their expenses incurred.
