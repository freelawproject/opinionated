The proposed project is located near one unpermitted private airstrip [(Airport)], which is located 1.2 miles northwest or west of the project site boundary. MM 4.8-8 would ensure that the proposed project complies with all FAA regulations regarding structures located within proximity to airstrips.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">\u201cMitigation Measures[:] [\u00b6] Implement [measure] 4.8-8.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">\u201cLevel of Significance after Mitigationf:] [][] Impacts would be less than significant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b341-9\">\u201cMM 4.8-8[:] Prior to issuance of building permits, the project proponents shall submit Form 7460-1 (Noti[ce] of Proposed Construction or Alteration) to the [FAA], in the form and manner prescribed in 14 Code of Federal Regulation[s] [part 77.7]. The project proponents shall also provide documentation to the [County] Planning and Community Development Department demonstrating that the [FAA] has issued a \u2018Determination of No Hazard to Air Navigation.\u2019 This documentation shall include: (1) written concurrence from the military authority responsible for operations in the flight area depicted in [the County\u2019s] Zoning Ordinance Figure 19.08.160 that all project components would create no significant military mission impacts; (2) a wind turbine generator lighting plan; and (3) a helicopter lift plan demonstrating compliance with all requirements set forth by the [FAA] and [the] County. Documentation shall also be furnished to the [County] Planning and Community Development Department demonstrating that a copy of the approved form(s) has been provided to the operators of [Airport], California City Municipal Airport, Tehachapi Municipal Airport, Edwards Air Force Base, China Lake Naval Air Weapons Station, and Fort Irwin/National Training Center.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b341-10\">\u201cThe FAA regulates aviation at regional, public, private, and military airports .... The FAA regulates objects affecting navigable airspace and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>structures taller than 200 feet according to . . . [14 Code of Federal Regulations part 77.9]. The U.S. and California Departments of Transportation also require the proponent to submit FAA Form 7460-1, Notice of Proposed Construction or Alteration. According to [14 Code of Federal Regulations part 77.5], notification allows the FAA to identify potential aeronautical hazards in advance, thus preventing or minimizing any adverse impacts on the safe and efficient use of navigable airspace. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">\u201cAs described in [14 Code of Federal Regulations part 77.9] (Construction or alteration requiring notice), each sponsor who proposes any of the following construction or alteration scenarios shall notify the FAA in the form and manner prescribed in [14 Code of Federal Regulations part 77.7]: [][] (1) Any construction or alteration of more than 200 feet in height above the ground level at its site.

The notice required must be submitted at least [45] days before the earlier of the following dates: (1) the date the proposed construction or alteration is to begin or (2) the date an application for a construction permit is to be filed.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">The draft FIR also described three alternatives.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> \u201cAlternative A: No Project\u201d precluded construction and maintained the environmental status quo for the foreseeable future. \u201cAlternative B: Relocate to San Gorgonio Wind Resource[] Area\u201d moved the project to a comparable site in Riverside County. Lastly, \u201cAlternative C: Reduced Project Size\u201d eliminated up to 23 generators in areas of high biological and cultural resource sensitivity. The draft FIR concluded:</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">\u201cAlternative A, the No Project Alternative, would be environmentally superior to the project on the basis of the minimization or avoidance of physical environmental impacts. Section 15126.6(e)(2) of the . . . Guidelines <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>states that if the no project alternative is found to be environmentally superior, \u2018the EIR shall also identify an environmentally superior alternative among the other alternatives.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\">\u201cDue to the reduction of impacts to aesthetics, biological resources, and cultural resources achieved by Alternative C (Reduced Project Size), it is considered the environmentally superior alternative. Alternative C reduces the significant and unavoidable impacts of the proposed project . . . and has less severe significant impacts as compared to Alternative B . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">\u201cAlternative C would achieve some of the project proponents^] objectives. Because the alternative would reduce the project by up to 23 WTG[\u2019]s, it would reduce the contribution towards achieving the California [Renewable Portfolio Standard] goal . . . and would subsequently reduce the benefit renewable energy offers to greenhouse gas emissions . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">Airport, a private airport owned by Dr. Philippe Athuil <em>(ante, </em>fn. 4), is located on a 296-acre plot adjacent to the Tehachapi Wind Resource Area,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> about 1.2 miles from the project site. One of Athuil\u2019s attorneys, Dale J. Goldsmith, sent the following letter dated June 20, 2011, to the County:</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">\u201cDr. Athuil is very concerned that the construction and operation of the Project as proposed will present severe safety risks to the glider pilots who use [Airport], The Project proposes to erect a number of up to 500-foot-tall [WTG\u2019s] in the glide path of the gliders. A collision between a glider and a WTG could maim or kill the pilot. The Project can and should be modified to eliminate this safety hazard to allow [Airport] and the Project to coexist. m \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 <em>m</em></p>\n<p id=\"b343-9\">\u201c. . . [E]xisting terrain limits the number of feasible ingress and egress routes to and from [Airport]. The proposed WTG\u2019s would block or severely limit the use of two of the three primary approach routes, leaving only one practical air route to and from [Airport], Moreover, the proposed WTG sites are densely clustered and positioned on ridges that normally provide additional lift for gliders attempting to return to the airport. Unpowered aircraft such as gliders have extremely shallow descent ratios, ranging from 50-100 to 1 without the use of spoilers or other lift reducing equipment techniques. Increasing the height of the obstruction field with WTG[\u2019]s and eliminating a pilot\u2019s ability to safely use the ridgeline will change the pilot\u2019s transit strategy and substantially decrease margins of safety for landing at [Airport]. This could result in tragic consequences. [\u00b6]... [\u00b6]</p>\n<p id=\"b344-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>\u201cThe [draft EIR] does not consider the Project\u2019s land use compatibility with adjoining land uses, including [Airport], As discussed above, the WTG[\u2019]s along the nearby ridgeline will severely impact current glider operations at [Airport] and create significant safety hazards. It also will likely preclude future commercial use of [Airport], The [draft EIR] should be revised to include this analysis, disclose adverse impacts, and require mitigation measures, such as relocating the WTG[\u2019]s from the ridgelines, to reduce the impacts to less than significant].\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">In July 2011, the County published the final EIR, which contained the following response to Goldsmith\u2019s June 20, 2011, letter:</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">\u201c[Airport] was considered in the analysis and the implementation of [measure 4.8-8]. . . . [\u00b6] . . . [f . . . [measure] 4.8-8 would require that the project proponent file a form 7460-1, Noti[ce] of Proposed Construction or Alteration, with the FAA for each WTG, meteorological evaluation] tower, transmission line tower and construction crane meeting the FAA 7460 requirements for a determination of no hazard to air navigation. If the FAA determines that the project would result in a potential obstruction unless reduced to a specified height, the project proponents would be required to work with the FAA to resolve any adverse effects on aeronautical operations. This mitigation measure would ensure less than significant impacts to existing aviation facilities and airspace use. The [FAA] makes the final determination on safety issues related to flight hazard.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">Howard Weinberg, another of Athuil\u2019s attorneys, provided the County with a report by William P. Long dated August 10, 2011. In his report, Long detailed:</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">\u201cAs an Aviation Services Professional, my career includes experience in aircraft ground services, air traffic control, airspace management, airport operations management, aviation system development and as a Senior Aviation Consultant and former [FAA] Airport Certification/Safety Inspector. I possess a rich and uniquely diverse foundation of ensuring airport environments that support and encourage safe and practical aircraft operations which in turn enhances the safety of communities enhanced and/or impacted by aviation. ... [][].. . [\u00b6]</p>\n<p id=\"b345-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>\u201cIt is my understanding that two separate FAA Form 7460-1 applications were made by the Project proponents with regard to proposed construction of WTG[\u2019s] .... [Athuil] and his representatives have never been contacted by the FAA, have never been invited to submit comments to the safety analysis performed by the FAA, and have never received copies of the determinations allegedly issued by the FAA. All of this is a direct violation of the formal process, procedures and protocol required by the operating rules and policies of the FAA. [][] . There is little credibility to any FAA safety study conducted based solely upon the FAA Form 7460-1 submitted by the Project applicants. The only legitimate safety review must be conducted as part of a public process, including comments by the stakeholders who will be the direct beneficiaries of a proper safety study, and who, without a proper[] safety study, will be the injured parties colliding with dangerously placed WTG[\u2019]s.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">On August 11, 2011, the County\u2019s planning commission conducted a public hearing and recommended EIR certification and project approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">On or after August 29, 2011, Zachary Walton, counsel for North Sky River, provided the County with an airspace and obstacle evaluation study by Ron Morgan of JDA Aviation Technology Solutions. In this study, Morgan disputed Long\u2019s August 10, 2011, report:</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">\u201c[Airport] is a private-use airport and not subject to the same protections afforded to airports that serve the public. That being said, the FAA has means to mitigate turbine development in close proximity to airport finals and has done so at many airports around the country ....</p>\n<p id=\"b345-8\">\u201cAnalysis conducted by the FAA shows that there is no airspace compatibility issue to [Airport] as a result of [North Sky River\u2019s share of generators]. All 102 turbines have been issued Determinations of No Hazard. Very few airports in the United States, either private or public, have an obstruction free (ground up) surface around the airport, [\u00b6] . . . [][]</p>\n<p id=\"b345-9\">\u201cMr. Long\u2019s finding that no valid conclusions of airspace safety could be concluded are . . . based upon the assumption that A) not all FAA offices were consulted in the [Obstruction Evaluation] process and B) that comments were not solicited from the airport owner. JDA contacted the FAA specialist who handled these cases and found that all offices either responded to the case or were auto-screened. In the development of the [Obstruction Evaluation/Airport Airspace Analysis] automation system, the FAA developed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>criteria for the assessment of aeronautical studies by the disparate lines of business. Certain offices opted to allow for automated review of certain cases based upon the location and height of the planned obstacle. The Office of Airports, for example, auto-screens all cases with planned structures that are greater than 3 nautical miles from a public-use airport reference point. However, the office with responsibility for assessing impact on [Visual Flight Rule] operations did review the case and found that the planned structures would have no adverse impact on [Visual Flight Rule] operations.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">\u201cFAA Order 7400.2H paragraph 6-3-17(a)(l) states that \u2018Normally, any structure that would exceed obstruction standards, affect an airport, have possible [Visual Flight Rule] effect, and/or require a change in aeronautical operations or procedures should always be circularized.\u2019 The planned turbines do not exceed the obstruction standards specified in 14 [Code of Federal Regulations] Part 77. The planned turbines were found to have no impact on a public use airport and have no possible [Visual Flight Rule] effect. No aeronautical operations or procedures would be changed as a result of the planned turbines. Therefore, it was not necessary to circularize the cases. However, had the cases been circularized and had [Airport\u2019s] owner objected to the planned turbines based on perceived impacts to [Airport], the FAA would likely have found that neither the standards for adverse effect nor substantial adverse effect would have been met. This would have resulted in the issuance of determinations of no hazard for all 102 cases reviewed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">In a letter to the Board dated September 12, 2011, Weinberg remarked:</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">\u201cWe have repeatedly asked for aviation safety studies to be performed, but the County has refused. We are now informed that [North Sky River] has had the FAA conduct some sort of \u2018automated\u2019 or desktop review of the aviation risks posed by [North Sky River\u2019s portion of the project]. As discussed below, these FAA Determinations (which have not been provided to us or to the public) are inaccurate and inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">\u201cOur client, at some considerable expense, has had an aviation expert develop [] a map of the Project\u2019s] area[] and the areas of intersection between the proposed WTG[\u2019]s and the flight paths of aircraft to and from [Airport] .... One can, with no engineering or surveying expertise, immediately determine from the [m]op[] that the proposed WTG locations will result in an unavoidable safety problem for aircraft using [Airport]. In fact, if the Project[] [is] approved and constructed, it would be so dangerous to fly near the WTG[\u2019]s that it is likely [Airport] would become unusable. As the [m]op[] make[s] clear, the Project[] cannot be approved until a detailed and proper aviation safety <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>study is conducted and then the County can consider the aviation safety impacts of the Project.[<footnotemark>15</footnotemark>] [\u00b6] . . . [j[]</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\">\u201cThe Project cannot be now approved, because there is no required mitigation at all. In the case of [Airport], the FAA has no authority to require the relocation of the WTG[\u2019]s, the change in their size or orientation \u2014 in fact, the FAA has no authority whatsoever regarding the construction of the proposed Project. All that the FAA can do is study the WTG[\u2019]s to be constructed and then determine the nature and extent of the aviation safety risk that will be created by such construction. Simply requiring the project applicant, at some time in the future, to obtain a Determination of No Aviation Risk prior to the issuance of a building permit is not [a] well[]defined or adequate mitigation measure. Also, the County has failed to identify and consider all feasible mitigation measures. One example of a feasible mitigation measure is to relocate or eliminate all of the WTG[\u2019]s in the flight paths of aircraft using [Airport] (i.e. the WTG[\u2019]s shown on the [m]op as interfering with aviation flight paths). This one mitigation measure alone is both feasible and necessary, [\u00b6] . . . [\u00b6]</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">\u201c[Morgan\u2019s letter] states that [North Sky River] has obtained 102 Determinations of No Hazard from the FAA .... As you know from our previous Comment Letters, the owner of [Airport] has never been contacted by the FAA or [North Sky River] and has never given input into any FAA safety determination, nor has Dr. Athuil (or this firm) ever received a copy of the FAA Determinations, [\u00b6] . . . To date, the applicants for the Project have spent a considerable amount of time and legal maneuvering to avoid disclosure of their interaction with the FAA and the results of the FAA review. Even now, neither the County nor the public has reviewed the FAA Determinations. We believe that when a proper and fully public aviation safety study is completed, it will show the dire and unmitigated aviation safety impacts that would be created if the Project[] [was] constructed, [\u00b6] . . .

Dr. Athuil has never been contacted by the FAA in connection with any such Determination, no member of the FAA has ever visited [Airport] to consider the physical layout of the airport and its orientation and proximity to the proposed WTG[\u2019]s, no[r] has any hearing been held to consider this determination. These facts were confirmed by [Morgan\u2019s letter] that explained the FAA Determinations were \u2018auto-screened;\u2019 technical jargon for the FAA analyzing hazards based only upon the data presented to them by [North Sky River], without any confirmation that the data in fact comports with conditions on the ground \u2014 and without contacting [Airport] . ...

To our knowledge, the only way that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>the FAA could have analyzed the aviation safety impacts of the WTG[\u2019]s would have been to use the old data in their database \u2014 that showed the old runway configurations for [Airport]. Of course, if the FAA did use these old runways as the basis of the FAA Determinations, they would have made significantly different conclusions about safety, because the old runway configurations did not have the direct flight path impacts into the WTG[\u2019]s that exist now for the current runway configurations.\u201d (Fns. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">In a report to the Board dated September 13, 2011, the County\u2019s staff responded to Weinberg\u2019s September 12, 2011, letter:</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">\u201c[T]he [d]raft FIR discussed [Airport] and it was considered in the analysis and implementation of [d]raft FIR MM 4.8-8. [measure 4.8-8] would require that the project proponents file a form 7460-1, Noti[ce] of Proposed Construction or Alteration, with the FAA for each [generator], meteorological evaluation] tower, transmission line tower, and construction crane meeting the FAA 7460 requirements for a determination of no hazard to air navigation. If the FAA determines that the project would result in a potential obstruction unless reduced to a specified height, the project proponents would be required to work with the FAA to resolve any adverse effects on aeronautical operations. This mitigation measure would ensure that the project\u2019s impacts on the environment would result in less than significant impact to existing aviation facilities and airspace use. [\u00b6]... [\u00b6]</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">\u201cWith regard to the concerns raised by Mr. Weinberg regarding the adequacy of the FAA\u2019s determinations on \u2018no hazard to air navigation,[\u2019] Staff notes that the FAA is the expert federal Agency in the field of air navigation and in determining hazards to air navigation. A major component of the FAA\u2019s purpose is to ensure the safety of aircraft and the efficient use of airspace. The FAA has issued a \u2018Determination of No Hazard\u2019 for . . . both components of the project, including . . . North Sky River[\u2019s] and Jawbone Wind Energy[\u2019s] portions.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">\u201cThis expert opinion is supported by a professionally prepared aeronautical study .... Additionally, Staff notes that 14 [Code of Federal Regulations] Part 77 requires the FAA to evaluate and produce a report on the construction of objects that may constitute a hazard to air navigation, for the purpose of ensuring the safety of aircraft and the efficient use of airspace. Thus, Staff concludes that it is appropriate for the County to rely upon the FAA\u2019s expertise in evaluating whether the project will have an impact on air navigation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b349-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>The County\u2019s staff further advised in an addendum report to the Board dated September 13, 2011:</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">\u201cGenerally, airports are protected from encroachment by surrounding properties through the establishment of land use compatibility plans for public use airports, by airports acquiring avigation easements, or by the purchase of buffer lands. Staff notes that the proposed project is not located within the sphere of influence of any adopted . . . Airport Land Use Compatibility Plan, nor has [Airport] actively pursued or attempted to establish any avigation easements on adjacent properties. With no other land use mechanism having been established by [Airport], the [County] concludes that the [FAA] is the most appropriate agency to make any final determinations as related to any Hazards to Flight associated with the proposed project, [\u00b6] . . . [\u00b6]</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">\u201c. . . Staff notes that ... an analysis of the proposed project and its potential impacts to [Airport] . . . was prepared by Mr. Ron Morgan in association with JDA Aviation Technology Solutions. Mr. Morgan is the former Director of the FAA\u2019s Air Traffic Services Division and is an expert in the field of aviation. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">\u201cAs previously stated, it was the determination of the [County] that impact to [Airport] could be reduced to less than significant. . . with implementation of the identified mitigation measure[]. This conclusion was further verified by Mr. Morgan. Your Board should be advised that Mr. Weinberg disagrees with this conclusion. [Section] 15151 specifically states that a disagreement among experts does not make an EIR inadequate, but that the EIR should summarize the main points of disagreement among the experts. Staff notes that these points of contention as raised by Mr. Weinberg have been described in the . . . Final EIR, and in subsequent Staff Reports prepared for this project, pursuant to CEQA. Additionally, the [FAA] has been provided copies of the EIR and notifications of the proposed hearings. As of the time of this writing, Staff has not received any comments from the FAA indicating that additional analysis is required to determine whether or not construction of [generators] within the project boundary would result in a significant hazard to flight. It is the [County]\u2019s determination that under CEQA, sufficient information has been included into the record regarding the potential impacts to [Airport] for your Board to take action today regarding the proposed project. Based on all information in the record, the [County] continues to believe that with implementation of [measure] 4.8-8, requiring submittal of a Form 7460 with the FAA, impacts will be reduced to a less th[a]n significant impact. ['][]... [][]</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">\u201c. . . [T]he project before your Board for consideration is a request to incorporate the [wind energy combining district] to various parcels within the project area. Although the Final EIR prepared for the project has identified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>prehminary locations for future [generators], these locations are subject to change based on compliance with the [County\u2019s] Zoning Ordinance and other micro-siting requirements presented in the EIR that have yet to take place. The FAA determinations have not been included into the record because at this time the existing zoning would not allow for the installation of any WTG[\u2019s] on site. Although the applicant may have formal determinations by the FAA as they relate to Determinations of No Hazard to Flight, Staff notes that these FAA determinations are preliminary and were submitted by the applicant to the FAA to determine whether there were any existing conditions that would prevent the implementation of [generators] within the project boundary. Any change in location and[/]or size of the proposed WTG\u2019s would require the project proponent to resubmit their Form 7460 to the FAA for consideration, [\u00b6] . . . [\u00b6]</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">\u201cThe commenter states that the owner of [Airport] was not contacted by the FAA regarding any hazard to flight determinations. Staff notes these determinations are made by the FAA and are outside the legal authority and control of the County. How the FAA makes these determinations are not germane to the land use actions before your Board for consideration today and are not subject to CEQA as it relates to this project. [|] . . . [\u00b6]</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">\u201c. . . If approved, the project proponent will be required to submit building permits for proposed turbines. Prior to issuance of that building permit, [measure] 4.8-8 requires the project proponent to submit to Staff an adequate FAA 7460 determination. Implementation of this measure will ensure that any restrictions identified by the FAA will be incorporated into the proposed project .... [T]he FAA has been provided copies of the EIR and hearing notices for the proposed project. No evidence has been submitted into the record by the FAA indicating that additional information is necessary at this time .... Should the FAA determine that construction of [generators] at specific locations would result in significant hazards to flight, the project proponent will be required to either reduce the turbine size, relocate the turbine or simply not construct that turbine at that location .... [I] ... [\u00b6]</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">\u201c. . . Staff explains that the final layout o[f] WTG[\u2019]s will be determined through final engineering and micro-siting if the project is approved, and that the full extent of the proposed [wind energy combining district] zone corridors where the WTG[\u2019]s could be located have been fully analyzed in the EIR. Staff also explains that in analyzing the proposed [e]ffects of the [generators], the Final EIR took a \u2018worst-case\u2019 scenario approach and assumed that the applicants would utilize the largest and tallest possible [generators] and analyzed for a maximum height of 497 feet. Therefore, the possible impacts of any of the proposed [generator] models have been disclosed. Staff notes that since that time, [North Sky River] has selected a WTG type that is less than 430 feet in height, which was analyzed in the EIR.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b351-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>The Board conducted a public hearing on September 13, 2011.

Nevertheless, \u201ca hazard/no-hazard determination . . . has substantial practical impact\u201d <em>(Aircraft Owners, supra, </em>at pp. 966-967) because it \u201ccan hinder the project sponsor in acquiring insurance, securing financing or <em>obtaining approval from state or local </em>authorities\u201d <em>(BFI Waste Systems of North America, Inc. v.

Thus, while the FAA could not halt construction of North Sky River\u2019s and Jawbone\u2019s WTG\u2019s if it deemed those structures hazardous, under measure 4.8-8 the County was bound to do so through the exercise of its police power.
