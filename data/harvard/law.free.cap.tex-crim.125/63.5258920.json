It appears to us that from a reading of the statute that the indictment charges the offense of selling liquor capable of producing intoxication, and in support hereof we refer to the cases of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>Tucker v. State, 251 S. W., 1090; Nowells v. State, 252 S.
