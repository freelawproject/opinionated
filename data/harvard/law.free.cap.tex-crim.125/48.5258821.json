While driving on the highway, deceased and her companion were overtaken by appellant and his brother, Bluit. Forcing the couple to accompany them, appellant and his brother drove to a secluded spot and stopped the automobile. Appellant made Carver get out of the car and go with him to a thicket. After firing two shots into Carver\u2019s body, which inflicted serious wounds, appellant returned to the automobile and took deceased into a field, where he requested her to have sexual intercourse with him. According to appellant\u2019s confession, deceased advised him that she was sick. Further, according to the confession, appellant verified deceased\u2019s statement by placing his hand on her. At this juncture Bluit Burkley shot deceased several times. Upon being arrested appellant directed the officers to the spot where deceased\u2019s body was found.
