Without discussing at any length the proposition of the duty of this court to reverse upon an error in the charge which might be deemed wrong, \u2014 in the absence of an exception to the charge, \u2014 we observe that the particular . complaint in this case is that the word \u201cNot\u201d was omitted at a place pointed out in the motion for rehearing. A supplemental transcript forwarded to the clerk of this court by the clerk of the trial court, containing a certified copy of the paragraph of the court\u2019s charge from which the word \u201cNot\u201d appeared to have been omitted, makes clear that the omission of said word in the charge as it appeared in the transcript was an error of the clerk of the lower court. The certified copy of the charge found in the supplemental transcript shows that word \u201cNot\u201d was in the charge as given.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-11\">The motion for rehearing will be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-12\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
