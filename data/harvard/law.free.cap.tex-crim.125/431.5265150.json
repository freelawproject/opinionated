On Wednesday, the 11th day of January, 1933, he again called her and told her that she was getting cancerous and if she did not bring the money to his office by 4:30 P. M. Friday he would come down there to where she was at work the next morning and do her like the doctors do a cancer: \u201ccut the money out of her hide.\u201d The testimony further shows that at the conclusion of said conversation the witness called Miss Mildred Douglas, an attorney at law, and conferred with her and then the two proceeded to the office of the district attorney where the complaint was filed against the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-3\">The defendant testifying in his own behalf admitted making the loan to Miss Bennett and his efforts to collect the same and that on the occasion in question he told her that he thought she was getting cancerous, but denied threatening to inflict any serious bodily injury upon her or to take her life.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">By bill of exception No. 1 appellant complains of the action of the trial court in refusing to sustain his motion to quash the information. The information contains four counts and .we have reached the conclusion that the second and third counts in the information are sufficiently certain and definite to charge the offense under article 1265, Penal Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">By bill of exception No. 3 the appellant complains of the action of the trial court in permitting the state to prove by Miss- Bennett that she borrowed $50.00 from the defendant but gave him a note for $75.00 payable in six months,, that the $25.00 was for interest. The court qualified said bill and by his qualification shows that when the question was propounded to Miss Bennett by the district attorney, \u2018How much did you owe?\u201d, the appellant, objected, and the district attorney then propounded the following question: \u201cIn other words you paid $25.00 to get $50.00?\u201d, to which the witness answered, \u201cYes sir\u201d; whereupon defendant again objected because the answer was irrelevant and immaterial and he asked that the same be stricken out, which was overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">By bill of exception No. 4 appellant complains of the action of the trial court in permitting the district attorney to prove by the defendant on cross-examination that the amount of. money he let her have was $50.00 and the amount he was to receive in return was $76.50, $26.50 in interest for six months, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>to which the appellant objected because it was immaterial irrelevant, inflammatory, and prejudicial, which objection was overruled. The court qualified this bill in the following language : \u201cThe matter of interest was gone into by the defendant when he testified on direct examination as follows: T told her we made you a loan and haven\u2019t made a nickel off of you. Don\u2019t you know we can\u2019t just pitch off money? I said we would like to have our money back. I don\u2019t want any interest on this. Give me only our money. Forget the interest. Give me the principal and I will call it square.\u2019 \u201d The appellant objected to the action of the district attorney in proving that he charged her $26.50 as interest because the same was immaterial, irrelevant, inflammatory, and prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">We believe that the appellant\u2019s position is well taken in that the testimony as set out in bills of exception Nos. 3 and 4 was irrelevant and immaterial in that it fails to throw any light upon the matter charged in the information; that it was prejudicial is self-evident. It merely had a tendency to show that the appellant was a Shylock, that he made an unconscionable contract with Miss Bennett and charged her usurious interest. This apparently did not enlighten the jury on the question of whether he had made a serious threat to inflict serious bodily injury or to take the life of Miss Bennett, but only tended to prejudice the jury against the appellant. From reading the record before us it appears that the trial of this case was a fair reproduction of the characters depicted by Shakespeare in his Merchant of Venice. There was Shylock demanding his pound of flesh and it seems that Portia was also present.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">By bill of exception No. 5 appellant complains of the action of the trial court in permitting the state to prove by Miss Bennett that her father was dead, to which the appellant objected because the same was immaterial, irrelevant, and inflammatory, which objection was by the court overruled. We are not advised what light this matter threw upon the question as to whether the appellant made a serious threat to inflict serious bodily injury upon or take the life of Miss Bennett, and we cannot imagine for what purpose this matter was introduced in evidence unless it was for the purpose of arousing the sympathy of the jury in favor of Miss Bennett and prejudicing the rights of the defendant. We believe that the court erred in not sustaining the appellants\u2019 objection to said testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">It can hardly be said that in view of the fact that this irrelevant, immaterial, and prejudicial testimony, as shown in bills of exception 3, 4, and 5, was permitted to be introduced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>and considered by the jury that the defendant had a fair trial. The sufficiency of the testimony under the rule laid down in the case of Haynie v. State, 2 Texas App., 168, also raises a very serious question.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-3\">For the errors hereinabove pointed out, the judgment of the trial court is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\"><em>\u25a0 </em>The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
