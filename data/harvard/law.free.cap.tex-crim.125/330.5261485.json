One of the optional penalties fixed by statute for theft of a chicken is confinement in the penitentiary \u201cfor not more than two years,\u201d no minimum term being fixed. We are at some loss, under the circumstances, to know how the Indeterminate Sentence Law (article 775, C. C. P.), should be given effect. It is certain that the jury might fix the punishment at one day or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>even \u2022 one hour in the penitentiary. It will perhaps \"answer foh all practical purposes to reform the sentence to read that appellant should be confined in the penitentiary for not less than one hour nor more than one year.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">As thus reformed, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\"><em>Judgment reformed, and, as reformed, </em>affirmed..</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
