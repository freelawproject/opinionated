The contention must be sustained. After detailing the transaction which resulted in the giving of the check to him, Mr. Rosener testified that he deposited the check in his bank in Temple, that it was returned unpaid; that he again deposited it in the Temple bank, and it was again returned unpaid, and that he had never received payment thereon. The witness further testified that he did not know why the check was returned unpaid. There is not one word of testimony in the record to indicate that said check was ever presented for payment to the Waco bank upon which it was drawn. There is an entire failure to prove the averment in the pleadings that it was so presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-10\">The prosecution was under the provisions of subdivision 4, article 1546, P. C. The Legislature, in undertaking to make the happening of certain things \u201cprima facie\u201d evidence of certain other things said, \u201cprovided, that if said check * * * be not paid on <em>presentation </em>the return of same shall be prima facie evidence,\u201d etc. We are not called upon to determine the validity of the proviso just quoted, and disclaim any intention to do so, but refer to it as clearly showing that the \u201cpresentation\u201d mentioned could refer to and mean only presentation for payment to the bank upon which the check was drawn.

W., 385.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">On account of the evidence failing to support the conviction the judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
