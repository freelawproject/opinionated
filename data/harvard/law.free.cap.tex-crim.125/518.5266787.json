M. Waggoner owned a ranch in Stonewall County on which he had about four hundred head of cattle. Travis Parnell looked after the cattle. He testified that the animals alleged to have been stolen were last seen by him in September, 1932; In the latter part of October, 1932, the sheriff found four head of cattle in the pasture of J. M. Golston. These cattle had been freshly branded over some old brands. On making an inspection of the animals, Mr. Waggoner identified them as his property. It appears that the old brands belonged to Mr. Wag-goner. Mr. Golston testified that appellant had stayed at his place from time to time, but had left some time in August, 1932, for the purpose of working on a road at Guthrie. He said that when the sheriff discovered Mr. Waggoner\u2019s cattle in his pasture he told him that he thought they were appellant\u2019s cattle. The sheriff testified that upon finding the cattle in Mr. Golston\u2019s pasture he had a conversation with appellant concerning the ownership of the animals. He said appellant told him that they were his cattle and that he had bought them from Henry Goody of Knox City; that he had changed the brands and had taken the cattle to the Bingham pasture; that the last time he saw them they were on the river; that he had bought the cattle about the 6th of July; that he did not see them any more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>until they were found in the Golston pasture; that he branded the cattle some time in September. The sheriff further testified that Henry Goody died July 15, 1932.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-3\">Appellant did not testify in his own behalf. His witness Hill testified that appellant had advised him that he had an opportunity to trade for some cattle that Henry Goody had; and that he told appellant he could trade some of his stock in if he desired. The proof was further to the effect that appellant made no effort to hide the cattle during the time they were in Golston\u2019s pasture.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">Appellant contends that the falsity of the explanation he made to the sheriff concerning his purchase of the cattle is not shown. We are unable to agree with this contention. It is observed that appellant stated that he bought the cattle from Goody. Goody died July 15, 1932. Further, it is observed that Travis Parnell, who took care of Mr. Waggoner\u2019s cattle, testified that the animals alleged to have been stolen were in Mr. Waggoner\u2019s pasture on September 26, 1932. He said: \u201cI remember the 26th of September because I was rounding up cattle and doctoring screw worms, and I remember seeing these two identical cattle on the 26th of September. I do not recall ever seeing them on the ranch between that time and the time I saw them in the Golston pasture.\u201d The jury were warranted in concluding that the cattle were in Mr. Waggoner\u2019s pasture on the 26th of September, as testified to by the witness Parnell. Manifestly, the testimony mentioned directly contradicted the statement appellant made to the sheriff concerning his purchase of the cattle from Goody. There could not have been a purchase from Goody after July, 1932, as Goody died during that month. In connection with this testimony, the jury were warranted in considering appellant\u2019s action in changing the brands on the cattle. A further circumstance tending to show the falsity of appellant\u2019s explanation was\" the fact that he branded the cattle during the month of September, 1932, that being the month they were apparently taken from the possession of Mr. Waggoner.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">Bill of exception No. 1 relates to the action of the trial judge in overruling the application for a continuance. In the qualification to the bill it is recited that at the time the application was presented to the court it contained no averment that appellant expected to procure the attendance of the witneseses at the next term of the court, and contained no averment that the witnesses were not absent by the procurement or consent of appellant; and, further, that it was not stated therein that there was no reasonable expectation that the attendance of the wit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>nesses could be secured during the term of the court by postponement of the trial to some future day of the term. Manifestly, as qualified, the bill of exception fails to reflect error. The application for continuance was fatally defective.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-3\">We do not think appellant\u2019s contention that there is a variance between the allegation and proof as to possession should be sustained. Possession was alleged in R. M. Waggoner. He testified that the ranch from which the cattle were taken was in his charge and under his control. Further, he said that the cattle were taken from his care and control. He said: \u201cYes, sir, I had these cows under my care and control.\u201d He stated that Travis Parnell had charge of the ranch and looked after the cattle, being in his employ. Mr. Parnell testified that he looked after Mr. Waggoner\u2019s cattle. If .appellant had developed the matter, he might have shown that possession should properly have been alleged in Parnell. However, under the circumstances, we think Mr. Waggoner\u2019s testimony to the effect that the animals were under his care and control supports the allegation in the indictment. See Haney v. State, 36 S. W. (2d) 1033.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b543-7\">ON MOTION FOR REHEARING.</p>\n<author id=\"b543-8\">LATTIMORE, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AqW\">Appellant insists that the proof does not make out a case of guilt. The facts are set out in our former opinion. Mr. Parnell swore that the alleged stolen cattle were in Waggoner\u2019s pasture on September 26, 1932, and that they bore Mr. Waggoner\u2019s brand. The same cattle were found the latter part of October in Mr. Colston\u2019s pasture with their brands changed. Appellant admitted changing the brands of the cattle, and explained his possession of said cattle, and his claim that they were his, and that he had a right to change their brand by saying that he bought the cattle in question from Henry Goody. The state replied by proof that Mr. Goody was killed in an automobile accident in July, 1932. This sufficiently showed the falsity of appellant\u2019s claim of purchase. This court has held in authorities too numerous to mention that the possession of recently stolen property is a sufficient circumstance to justify the conclusion of guilt of the possessor, of the theft of such property. It seems well established, also, that when the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>state relies upon proof of such fact to make out guilt, the proof must further show that if the accused, when his possession of such property was first challenged, made an explanation which was natural and reasonable, and probably true, which might operate to rebut the inference of theft based on the proposition of recent possession, that such explanation was in fact false; We think the state\u2019s proof in this case entirely negatives the possibility of appellant having bought the animals in question from Mr. Goody in July.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">The motion for rehearing will be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
