He placed on the witness stand a number of witnesses, who testified that his general reputation for honesty and fair-dealing was good. Over appellant\u2019s objection, the district attorney then questioned the witnesses concerning appellant\u2019s general reputation in the community in which he lived as to being a peaceable and law-abiding citizen. The question was proper. Appellant having filed an application for a suspended sentence, it was proper for the state to show that his general reputation in the community in which he resided for being peaceable and law-abiding was bad.
