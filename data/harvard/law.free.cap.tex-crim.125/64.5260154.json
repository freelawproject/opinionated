It appears to us that from a reading of the statute that the indictment charges the offense of possessing for the purpose of sale liquor capable of producing intoxication, and in support hereof we refer to the cases of Tucker v. State, 251 S. W., 1090; Nowells v. State, 252 S. W., 550.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">No other question being raised and no errors appearing in the record before us, the judgment of the trial court is in all things affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b87-8\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
