The testimony further shows that John Stachowiak and appellant\u2019s wife occupied the Christian Building situated on Railroad street in said town; that in the front part of said building the said John Stachowiak ran a bakery and market while in the rear of said building appellant\u2019s wife ran a restaurant. That on the 24th day of December, A. D. 1932, the officers, by virtue of a search warrant, searched the Christian building and found in the restaurant twenty-one pints of whisky. On the 30th day of December, 1932, said officers, by virtue of a search warrant, went out to the farm of appellant and searched his dwelling, barn, outhouses, and a tenant house occupied by Mrs. Kate Ruder, and in appellant\u2019s residence they found a one-half gallon of whisky; in an outhouse located about fifteen yards from the dwelling house they found one and one-half gallons of whisky, and in the tenant house occupied by Mrs. Kate Ruder they found a ten gallon keg of whisky. The appellant denied having any knowledge of the liquor in the restaurant or any other place except that in his home which he claimed he had for medicinal purposes. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>By a number of witnesses the appellant proved a good reputation as a law abiding citizen.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">At the conclusion of the testimony, and before the court submitted his charge to the jury, the appellant filed written objections to the court\u2019s charge because the charge did not limit and confine the jury in their deliberations to one of the two transactions, viz: December 24th or December 30th, 1932, but the court declined to reform his charge so as to meet appellant\u2019s objections, to which appellant excepted. We believe that appellant\u2019s position is well taken. The state should have elected of which transaction it would seek a conviction, and the court should have reformed his charge and confined the jury in its deliberation to either one of the two transactions, and in support of our views as herein expressed we refer to the following authorities: Stringer v. State, 110 Texas Crim. Rep., 641, 10 S. W. (2d) 721; Crosslin v. State 235 S. W., 905; Bader v. State, 122 S. W., 555; Batchelor v. State, 55 S. W., 491; Powell v. State, 82 S. W., 516.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">We are also of the opinion that the testimony of the officers relating to the whisky found in the restaurant and that found in the house occupied by Mrs. Ruder was not admissible against the defendant unless it was shown that he had some connection therewith.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">For the errors pointed out, the judgment of the trial court is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b295-9\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
