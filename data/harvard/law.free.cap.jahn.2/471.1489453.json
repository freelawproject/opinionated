Marsham, deceased, who died intestate, \u2022and said real estate descended to plaintiff in fee-simple; that .soon after the death of her mother, plaintiff and her husband, who resided in Columbus, Ohio, visited said James Marsham -at Galion; that up to said visit plaintiff was ignorant in regard to her ownership of said real estate in Morrow county, .and of her mother\u2019s former title thereto, and had been willfully kept in ignorance thereof by her step-father; that she knew that said Galion property was in her mother\u2019s name, but said Marsham represented to her, at that time, that it was bought with his money, when in fact the same was purchased with funds of plaintiff\u2019s mother through the agency of' said Marsham, which was studiously kept from plaintiff\u2019s knowledge; that on the occasion of said visit, said Marsham introduced the subject of said property, and represented that he \u25a0owed her mother $2,000; that he had been indebted to her a long time and had been paying interest thereon; that said indebtedness arose from money\u2019s belonging to her which he had collected and used; that he had caused the deeds to be placed in her name solely as a security for said money, and owed her that sum and no more, and that she had no other interest or title to said real estate, other than as security for .said $2,000, which was the value of plaintiff\u2019s interest therein; \u2022that he thereupon proposed that plaintiff deed back said real <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>estate to him, and he would give her his notes for $2,000r secured by mortgage on the property; that plaintiff told him she knew nothing about her mother\u2019s real property, but she-would have to take his word for it all; that he thereupon assured plaintiff of the truth of his statements, and that she might depend on what he told her regarding, the same; that-she thereupon procured her husband to join with her in a. deed for the property, and delivered it to said James Marsham' believing all his statements to be true, and took his two-promissory notes for $1,000 each, for one and two years respectively, with interest, and secured by mortgage on the premises ; that she believed, as said Marsham well knew, that he was-the real owner of said real estate, and that her mother\u2019s title-was but security for said $2,000 as represented, and but for said representations she would not have made said conveyance and taken said securities; that said real estate and plaintiff\u2019s title thereto were at the time worth $12,500, as was well known to said James Marsham; that plaintiff remained in ignorance of her rights and title until after her step-father\u2019s death, who died intestate, on the 6th day of Duly, A. D. 1884; that A. K. Dun was, on the 16th day of July, 1885, appointed administrator of said estate; that on the 7th day of July, A. D. 1884, she learned for the first time that her mother up to the time of her death, was the absolute owner in feesjmple of said real estate in her own right, and that at the same time she learned the further fact that an adjudication had been made by the court of common pleas of said county of Morrow, in a litigated suit attacking the title of plaintiff\u2019s mother to said farm, in which suit she, the said James Mar-sham and others were parties defendants, wherein it was found and decided that said real estate was owned in fee-simple by said Mary Jane Marsham. Plaintiff\u2019s petition further alleged that sundry payments aggregating some $782' had been paid and credited on the first note secured by said mortgage; and alleged that said James Marsham having-obtained said conveyance in manner aforesaid, his representatives, who are made parties, defendants, should therefore be decreed to pay the full value of said real estate, and that the remainder of said sum over and above said mortgage security-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>should be declared an equitable lien against the same, and .prayed for a decree accordingly.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b498-5\">The defendants filed a general demurrer to said petition.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b498-6\"><em>8.

She must either affirm or repudiate her conveyance of the property. There cannot be a vendor\u2019s \u25a0lien unless there has been a sale \u2014 and the facts set forth in plaintiff\u2019s petition do not show a sale by plaintiff, but her deed constituted said property a trust in James Marshman for plaintiff as the beneficiary. The means alleged by which Mashman obtained the legal title, to the property, render it unconscientious for him or his representatives as holders of the legal title, to retain or enjoy the beneficial interest. Equity impresses a constructive trust on the property thus acquired in favor of the plaintiff, who under the facts pleaded is equitably entitled to the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-10\">The plaintiff being the beneficiary of the trust, and the true owner of the property, may, under the state of facts set forth, \u25a0compel the trustee and his representatives to convey the trust property, and to account for and pay over the rents and profits.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-11\">These principles are clearly expounded in Pomeroy\u2019s Equity Jurisprudence, sections 1044, 1053, and 1058.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-12\">The demurrer is therefore sustained, and leave will be given .the plaintiff to amend her petition.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
