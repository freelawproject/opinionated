The district court granted summary judgment to the defendants on immunity grounds, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1502-10\">On June 13, 1985, a United States magistrate issued a federal search warrant authorizing a search of the premises of S.W. Daniel, Inc. (\u201cS.W.D.\u201d) for certain business records constituting evidence of possible violations of the National Firearms Act. At 2:15 p.m. on the same day, the defendants \u2014 agents of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (\u201cA.T.F.\u201d) and an Atlanta police officer \u2014 arrived at the named location. An A.T.F. agent showed the search warrant to plaintiff Sylvia Daniel, the proprietor of S.W.D. During the initial portion of the search, the officers required plaintiff to remain on the business premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b1502-11\">The parties dispute the length of plaintiffs detention. According to plaintiff, she was allowed to leave sometime between 4:30 p.m. and 5:00 p.m. According to defendants, she was required to remain and did remain on the premises for approximately thirty minutes of the search.</p>\n<p id=\"b1502-14\">Plaintiff subsequently filed this <em>Bivens (Bivens v. Six Unknown Federal Narcotics Agents, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971)), and \u00a7 1983 lawsuit against defendants, alleging that her detention violated her constitutional rights. In addition, her complaint raised state law tort claims against the defendants. The district court granted summary judgment for the defendants, on the grounds that defendants had qualified immunity from the constitutional claims and absolute immunity from the state law claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1502-15\">Since plaintiff has not mentioned on appeal the issue of absolute immunity from state law tort claims, we deem this issue to be abandoned. <em>See Rogero v. Noone, </em>704 F.2d 518, 520 n. 1 (11th Cir.1983). The sole issue in this appeal is whether defendants are entitled to qualified immunity from plaintiffs constitutional tort claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1502-16\">The doctrine of qualified immunity applies both to plaintiffs <em>Bivens </em>action against the federal defendants and plaintiffs \u00a7 1983 action against the Atlanta police officer. <em>See Harlow v. Fitzgerald, </em>457 U.S. 800, 819 n. 30, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 2738 n. 30, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982). Under the qualified immunity doctrine, government officials performing discretionary functions are shielded from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate \u201cclearly established ... constitutional rights\u201d of which a reasonable person should have known. <em>Id., </em>457 U.S. at 819, 102 S.Ct. at 2738.</p>\n<p id=\"b1502-17\">Nothing in the record suggests that defendants had probable cause for detaining Ms. Daniel, as opposed to searching the business premises. Moreover, since we are reviewing a summary judgment, we must resolve all factual ambiguities in favor of the party opposing the motion. <em>Wilson v. Taylor, </em>658 F.2d 1021, 1023 (5th Cir. Unit B 1981).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thus, we assume that Ms. Daniel was detained for two hours and forty-five minutes (i.e., until 5 p.m.). To analyze <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1403\">*1403</page-number>whether defendants are entitled to qualified immunity, we must determine whether defendant\u2019s detention of the plaintiff without probable cause while executing a search warrant violated a \u201cclearly established\u201d constitutional right.</p>\n<p id=\"b1503-4\">As a general rule, an official seizure of a person must be supported by probable cause, even if no formal arrest is made. <em>Dunaway v. New York, </em>442 U.S. 200, 99 S.Ct. 2248, 60 L.Ed.2d 824 (1979). The Supreme Court, however, has carved exceptions from this rule where a limited intrusion on a citizen\u2019s privacy is justified by special law enforcement interests. <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed. 889 (1968) (even though no probable cause exists, an officer can \u201cfrisk\u201d for weapons if he reasonably believes he is dealing with an armed and dangerous suspect); <em>Adams v. Williams, </em>407 U.S. 143, 92 S.Ct. 1921, 32 L.Ed.2d 612 (1972) (even though no probable cause exists, an officer can forcibly stop a suspect to investigate an informant\u2019s tip that suspect was armed and dangerous); <em>United States v. Brignoni-Ponce, </em>422 U.S. 873, 95 S.Ct. 2574, 45 L.Ed.2d 607 (1975) (even though no probable cause exists, roving Border Patrol agent can stop a vehicle near Mexican border if he is aware of specific articulable facts indicating that the vehicle contains illegal aliens.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1503-5\">In <em>Michigan v. Summers, </em>452 U.S. 692, 101 S.Ct. 2587, 69 L.Ed.2d 340 (1981), police officers detained a person while executing a search of a premises for drugs. Although a magistrate had determined that probable cause existed for the search, the Court assumed that probable cause did not exist for the detention of the person. <em>Id., </em>452 U.S. at 692, 702, 101 S.Ct. at 2591, 2593. The Court ruled that \u201ca warrant to search for contraband founded on probable cause implicitly carries with it the limited authority to detain the occupants of the premises while a proper search is conducted.\u201d <em>Id., </em>452 U.S. at 706, 101 S.Ct. at 2595 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1503-8\">In <em>Summers, </em>the Court explicitly reserved decision on \u201cwhether the same result would be justified if the search warrant merely authorized a search for evidence.\u201d <em>Id, </em>452 U.S. at 706 n. 21, 101 S.Ct. at 2595 n. 21. The present case involves a search for evidence rather than contraband, since the defendants searched for business records. If <em>Summers </em>extends to this case, of course, defendants did not violate plaintiff\u2019s fourth amendment rights and need no immunity. We do not decide now whether the <em>Summers </em>rule extends this far.</p>\n<p id=\"b1503-9\">To be entitled to qualified immunity, defendants need only show that it is an unsettled question of law whether <em>Summers </em>would be extended to this case. An examination of the Supreme Court\u2019s rationale in <em>Summers </em>indicates that it is not clear whether <em>Summers </em>would be extended to the present case. When determining whether a detention during a search for contraband pursuant to a search warrant is constitutional, the <em>Summers </em>Court weighed the intrusiveness of the detention, the law enforcement interests served thereby, and the individualized and articulable suspicion justifying such detention.</p>\n<p id=\"b1503-10\">The <em>Summers </em>Court began by considering the intrusiveness of the detention. The Court reasoned that (1) detention only adds minimally to the intrusion of the search itself, and most persons would prefer to remain to observe a search; (2) the police would not be likely to exploit or unduly prolong the detention to gain information; (3) a detention at home adds only minimally to the public stigma associated with the search. <em>Id., </em>452 U.S. at 702-03, 101 S.Ct. at 2593-94. The first of these \u201cintrusion\u201d rationales is clearly applicable in the present context, and nothing in the record<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1404\">*1404</page-number>suggests the second is not. Since plaintiff was detained on business premises which she owns, it can be argued that the detention added only minimally to the public stigma of the search. On the other hand, it can be argued that plaintiff was embarrassed \u201cin public\u201d by being detained with her employees. Thus, it is not clear whether the third \u201cintrusion\u201d rationale of <em>Summers </em>applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b1504-4\">Next, the <em>Summers </em>Court considered the law enforcement interests which would be served by permitting the detention: (1) preventing flight in the event that incriminatory evidence is found, (2) minimizing the risk of harm to the officials, and (3) facilitating the orderly completion of the search, inasmuch as the detained occupant may, out of self-interest, open locked doors or locked containers. <em>Id., </em>452 U.S. at 703-04, 101 S.Ct. at 2594. Since the defendants in the present case allowed plaintiff to leave before the completion of the search, the first of these law enforcement rationales may not be applicable. The second and third rationales, however, clearly do apply to the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1504-5\">Finally, the <em>Summers </em>Court considered the nature of the articulable and individualized suspicion on which the police base the detention of an occupant of premises subject to a search warrant. According to the Court, the fact that a search warrant has been issued means that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1504-6\">[a] judicial officer has determined that police have probable cause to believe that someone in the home is committing a crime____ The connection of an occupant to that home gives the police officer an easily identifiable and certain basis for determining suspicion of criminal activity justifies a detention of that occupant. <em>Id., </em>452 U.S. at 704-05, 101 S.Ct. at 2594-95.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1504-8\">This rationale is not applicable to a search for evidence, because the existence of mere evidence, as opposed to contraband, on the premises does not suggest that a crime is being committed on the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b1504-11\">Lower court case law has not settled this area of law. In dictum in a string citation, the Eleventh Circuit has cited <em>Summers </em>as authority for allowing detention of occupants while authorities search the premises pursuant to a search warrant, without distinction as to whether the search is for evidence of contraband. <em>See United States v. Puglisi, </em>723 F.2d 779, 785 (11th Cir.1984). Without analysis, the Fourth Circuit has held that officers may detain an occupant during a search for evidence pursuant to a search warrant, and cited <em>Summers </em>as authority for that holding. <em>United States v. Smith, </em>704 F.2d 723, 725 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, sub nom. Palmer v. Smith, </em>464 U.S. 817, 104 S.Ct. 76, 78 L.Ed.2d 88 (1983). Of course, neither of these decisions represent binding precedent on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b1504-12\">Plaintiff argues that her detention was so prolonged as to render the <em>Summers </em>exception clearly inapplicable in her case. She points to decisions which indicate that detentions without probable cause must be of short duration. In <em>United States v. Place, </em>462 U.S. 696, 103 S.Ct. 2637, 77 L.Ed.2d 110 (1983), the Supreme Court approved an agent\u2019s brief detention of a suspected drug courier\u2019s luggage, but held that the detention became unreasonable in the absence of probable cause when it continued for 90 minutes. The Court stated</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ABYu\">although we have recognized the reasonableness of seizures longer than ... momentary ones ..., the brevity of the invasion of the individual\u2019s Fourth Amendment interests is an important factor in determining whether the seizure is so minimally intrusive as to be justifiable on reasonable suspicion____ Thus, although we decline to adopt an outside time limitation for a permissible <em>Terry </em>stop, we have never approved a seizure of the person for the prolonged 90-min-ute period involved here and cannot do so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1405\">*1405</page-number>on the facts presented by this case. <em>Id., </em>462 U.S. at 709-10, 103 S.Ct. at 2645-46.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AUQ\">Plaintiff also cites <em>United States v. Puglisi, </em>723 F.2d 779 (11th Cir.1984), in which the Eleventh Circuit held that detention of a suspected drug courier\u2019s luggage for approximately 140 minutes violated the fourth amendment. Plaintiff\u2019s argument is not persuasive, however, because in the above cases the police had obtained <em>no warrant whatsoever.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1505-5\">In contrast, <em>Summers </em>involved detention during a premises search pursuant to a search warrant, and in <em>Summers </em>the court did not specify how long the detention lasted. The opinion of the Michigan Court of Appeals in the same case, however, suggests that the detention was not short: Summers was detained during the time it took a police officer \u201cto search the whole house\u201d and find heroin under a bar in the basement. <em>People v. Summers, </em>68 Mich.App. 571, 243 N.W.2d 689, 691 (1976), <em>aff'd, </em>407 Mich. 432, 286 N.W.2d 226 (1981), <em>rev\u2019d, </em>452 U.S. 692, 101 S.Ct. 2587, 69 L.Ed.2d 340 (1981). The Supreme Court\u2019s comment in <em>Summers </em>that \u201cpossibly a prolonged detention ... might lead to a different conclusion in an unusual case,\u201d 452 U.S. at 706 n. 21, 101 S.Ct. at 2595 n. 21, does not clearly establish that a detention of an occupant of the premises during the first two hours and forty-five minutes of a search is impermissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b1505-6\">Since the dissenters in <em>Summers </em>expressly raised the point, the <em>Summers </em>majority apparently appreciated that the concept of detention during searches of premises entails the prospect of detentions lasting several hours. <em>Michigan v. Summers, </em>452 U.S. 692, 712, 101 S.Ct. 2587, 2598, 69 L.Ed.2d 340 (1981) (Stewart, J., dissenting). Nevertheless, we do not hold that the detention in this case complied with the Constitution; we do not even address that question. Instead, we just recognize that the law is ambiguous as to when detention in conjunction with a lawful, premises search becomes impermissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b1505-9\">Although it might not do so, the <em>Summers </em>exception to the requirement of probable cause might extend to the present case. The unsettled character of this legal question is evident and demonstrates that no \u201cclearly established\u201d fourth amendment<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> right of plaintiff was violated. Therefore, defendants are entitled to qualified immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1505-10\">For these reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1502-12\">. In <em>Stein v. Reynolds Securities, Inc., 667 </em>F.2d 33, 34 (11th Cir.1982), the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals adopted as precedent all decisions of Unit B of the former Fifth Circuit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1503-6\">. Plaintiff has attempted to supplement the record on appeal with evidence suggesting that defendants used the search as a pretext for detaining plaintiff so that they could arrest her when a grand jury indicted her later that day. This evidence consists of depositions taken in another case involving different litigants, after the district court granted summary judgment in the present case. When reviewing the summary judgment, however, this Court cannot consider evidence which was not before the district court. <em>See Drexel v. Union Prescriptive Centers, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1404\">*1404</page-number>582 F.2d 781, 784 n. 4 (3d Cir.1978); <em>see generally </em>10 C. Wright &amp; A. Miller, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure, </em>\u00a7 2716, at 650-54 (2d ed. 1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1505-7\">. Plaintiff argues on appeal that defendants violated her sixth amendment right to counsel because they prevented her from speaking privately or face-to-face to her lawyer while she was detained. This Court will not consider this issue because, although plaintiff referred to a deprivation of her sixth amendment rights in her complaint, she made no other reference to this claim throughout the district court proceedings. For example, in the joint preliminary statement, there is no reference to a sixth amendment claim. Furthermore, in plaintiffs response to the federal defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment, she mentioned nothing about the sixth amendment claim. \u201cFailure to brief and argue an issue [at the district court level] is grounds for finding that the issue is abandoned.\" <em>Fehlhaber v. Fehlhaber, </em>681 F.2d 1015, 1030 (5th Cir. Unit B 1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>464 U.S. 818, 104 S.Ct. 79, 78 L.Ed.2d 90 (1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
