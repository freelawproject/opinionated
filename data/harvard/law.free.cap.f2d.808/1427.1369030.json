Based on the applicable law and the facts found by the district court, set forth in the magistrate\u2019s report after an evidentiary hearing, which findings are not clearly erroneous, judgment was properly entered against plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b1528-4\">A convicted prisoner has no absolute constitutional right to visitation, such privilege being subject to the discretion of prison authorities, provided the visitation policies of the prison meet legitimate penological objectives. <em>Lynott v. Henderson, </em>610 F.2d 340, 342 (5th Cir.1980); <em>McCray v. Sullivan, </em>509 F.2d 1332, 1334 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>423 U.S. 859, 96 S.Ct. 114, 46 L.Ed.2d 86 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b1528-5\">The facts in this case clearly meet that standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b1528-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
