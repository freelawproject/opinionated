We find that DSS regulation which limits \u201cemergency shelter care\u201d to children \u201cwho must be immediately removed from [their] homes,\u201d to be contrary to the plain meaning of Welfare and Institutions Code, sections 16501, subdivision (c) and 16501.1.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b162-10\">A. <em>Procedural Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b162-11\">1. <em>Montes </em>v. <em>Superior Court</em></p>\n<p id=\"b162-12\">On September 24, 1984, Salvador Montes and Joseph McCarthy (hereinafter referred to as petitioners) filed a taxpayers\u2019 mandamus action in Ventura County seeking to compel DSS and its director to assist homeless aid to families with dependent children (AFDC) families.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-13\">On February 1, 1985, petitioners moved for summary adjudication. The motion was denied on March 28, 1985. The trial court ruled that the statutes governing the AFDC program do not compel DSS to extend assistance in finding housing to homeless AFDC recipients. It further determined the Legislature to be the appropriate forum in which to address the issues tendered by petitioners.  The court held that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>petitioners lacked standing to seek relief, inasmuch as it had not been alleged that any of them were, in fact, homeless.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">A petition for a writ of mandate from this court was summarily denied on April 30, 1985. On July 11, 1985, the Supreme Court granted a petition for review and ordered the matter transferred to this court with directions that we issue an alternative writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">2. <em>Hansen </em>v. <em>Department of Social Services</em></p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">Plaintiffs (hereinafter also referred to as petitioners) filed a class action in Los Angeles County on behalf of families who are homeless, or who are imminently threatened with homelessness, to compel DSS to provide emergency shelter or other child welfare services to homeless families.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-8\">On May 12, 1986, the trial court decided that petitioners were likely to succeed in ultimately obtaining an injunction, and that a balancing of equities justified the issuance of a preliminary injunction. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7\u00a7 526, 527.) DSS was prohibited by the injunction from denying the provision of emergency shelter care \u201cso as to exclude homeless children, regardless of whether homeless children remain with their parent(s), guardian(s), or caretakers).\u201d DSS has appealed this ruling.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>B. <em>A Brief Overview of the Child Welfare Services Program.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">In 1961, the federal government began providing funds to assist the states in protecting abused and neglected children. (42 U.S.C \u00a7 606(a)(1); <em>Miller v. Youakim </em>(1979) 440 U.S. 125, 126-128 [59 L.Ed.2d 194, 198-199, 99 S.Ct. 957].) In ensuing years, there was a growing concern that the expenditure of these funds was resulting in the warehousing of children in foster homes and in the breakup of families. <em>(Smith </em>v. <em>Organization of Foster Families </em>(1977) 431 U.S. 816, 824-825 [53 L.Ed.2d 14, 22-23, 97 S.Ct. 2094]; <em>In re Jeremy C. </em>(1980) 109 Cal.App.3d 384, 393 [167 Cal.Rptr. 283]; Wald, <em>State Intervention on Behalf of </em>\u201cNeglected\u201d <em>Children: A Search for Realistic Standards </em>(1975) 27 Stan.L.Rev. 985, 994-995 (hereinafter referred to as Wald I).)</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">In an eifort to reverse this trend, Public Law No. 96-272 (Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980) amended the Social Security Act. (See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 622, 625(a)(1), 671, 672.) Public Law No. 96-272 requires that a participating state provide \u201cchild welfare services,\u201d with the purpose of fulfilling the following objectives: \u201c. . . (A) protecting and promoting the welfare of all children, including . . . homeless . . . children; (B) preventing or remedying, or assisting in the solution of problems which may result in the neglect, abuse, exploitation, or delinquency of children; (C) preventing the unnecessary separation of children from their families by identifying family problems, assisting families in resolving their problems, and preventing breakup of the family where the prevention of child removal is desirable and possible . . . .\u201d (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 625.)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Such wording makes evident congressional recognition of the inseverability of child well-being from the preservation of the family unit. It further recognizes that its objectives can best be accomplished by providing, whenever feasible, such child welfare services that further and preserve the integrity of the family and that such services be rendered \u201cto prevent or eliminate the need for removal of the child from his home . . . .\u201d (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 671(15)(A); see also 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 625(a)(1)(C).)</p>\n<p id=\"b164-9\">The Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980 reflects congressional awareness of the special solicitude that the United States Supreme Court has had for the family unit. The Supreme Court has long recognized that the institution of the family forms the matrix of our society. <em>(Wisconsin </em>v. <em>Yoder </em>(1972) 406 U.S. 205, 231-233 [32 L.Ed.2d 15, 34-35, 92 S.Ct. 1526]; <em>Stanley </em>v. <em>Illinois </em>(1972) 405 U.S. 645 [31 L.Ed.2d 551, 92 S.Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>1208].) \u201cIt is through the family that we inculcate and pass down many of our cherished values, moral and cultural. [Fn. deleted.]\u201d <em>(Moore </em>v. <em>East Cleveland </em>(1977) 431 U.S. 494, 503-504 [52 L.Ed.2d 531, 539-540, 97 S.Ct. 1932].) In <em>Lehr </em>v. <em>Robertson </em>(1983) 463 U.S. 248, 256 [77 L.Ed.2d 614, 623, 103 S.Ct. 2985], Justice Stevens observed: \u201cThe intangible fibers that connect parent and child have infinite variety. They are woven throughout the fabric of our society, providing it with strength, beauty, and flexibility.\u201d The unique ability of a parent to give love, guidance, protection, and encouragement to his or her child, lies at the very heart of the parental relationship. <em>(Rivera </em>v. <em>Minnich </em>(1987) 483 U.S._,_ [97 L.Ed.2d 473, 480, 107 S.Ct. 3001]; <em>Lehr </em>v. <em>Robinson, supra, </em>463 U.S. at p. 261 [77 L.Ed.2d at p. 626].)</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">In 1982, the California Legislature enacted Senate Bill No. 14.  The purpose of this measure is to bring California\u2019s child welfare laws into conformance with the philosophy of Public Law No. 96-272. (2 Cal. Juvenile Court Practice, (Cont. Ed. Bar Supp. 1986) \u00a7 15.3, p. 3.) DSS is mandated by this law to provide \u201csocial services which are directed toward the accomplishment of the following purposes: (a) protecting and promoting the welfare of all children, including handicapped, homeless, dependent, or neglected children; (b) preventing or remedying, or assisting in the solution of problems which may result in, the neglect, abuse, exploitation, or delinquency of the children; (c) preventing the unnecessary separation of children from their families by identifying family problems, assisting families in resolving their problems, and preventing breakup of the family where the prevention of child removal is desirable and possible; . . . Child welfare services may include, but are not limited to: . . . emergency shelter care . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 16501.)</p>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">Child welfare services consists of three components: Preplacement Preventive Services (\u00a7 16501.1); Family Reunification Program (\u00a7 16501.2); and Permanent Placement (\u00a7 16501.3). Preplacement Preventive Services are \u201cdesigned to help children remain with their families by preventing or eliminating the need for removal.\u201d This component contains two subparts, the first of which, the Emergency Response Program, provides, \u201c. . . intake services and crisis intervention to maintain the child safely in his or her own home or to protect the safety of the child.\u201d (\u00a7 16501.1, subd. (a).) The second component, the Family Maintenance Program, \u201c. . . is designed to provide time-limited protective services to prevent or remedy neglect, abuse, or exploitation, for the purposes of preventing separation of children from their families.\u201d (\u00a7 16501.1, subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>The Family Reunification Program is intended to provide social services . . when the child cannot safely remain at home, and needs temporary foster care, while services are provided to reunite the family.\u201d (\u00a7 16501.2.)</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">The purpose of the Permanent Placement Program is to provide \u201can alternative permanent family structure for children who because of abuse, neglect, or exploitation cannot safely remain at home and who are unlikely ever to return home.\u201d (\u00a7 16501.3.)</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">Emergency shelter care is made available under all three components of the Child Welfare Act. (\u00a7\u00a7 16504.1; 16506.1; 16507.1; and 16508.1.)</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">C. <em>The Legislative Intent of Term \u201cEmergency Shelter </em>Care\u201d <em>as Contained in Welfare and Institutions Code Section 16500 et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b166-8\">Section 16504.1 directs DSS to provide services to children in the form of \u201cemergency shelter care.\u201d DSS provides such care to homeless children.  However, DSS asserts that section 16504.1 does not require it to assist homeless families to obtain housing. The position of DSS is that destitute families who are homeless, but intact, are not entitled to any sum, beyond the amount of their monthly AFDC grant, to be used to secure safe and adequate shelter. In other words, homeless children are eligible to receive emergency shelter care, provided that such children have been, or are in the process of being, removed from their homes.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-9\">DSS operates its child welfare service program under the assumption that it is the intent of the Legislature that \u201cemergency shelter care,\u201d as mentioned in section 16504.1, be solely provided to a neglected or abused child during the period that the child is initally removed from his or her home for the purpose of evaluating the need for state intervention and protection. This position is reflected in the DSS regulations which provide that \u201cemergency shelter care\u201d be limited to a child \u201cwho must be immediately removed from his/her home.\u201d (Manual of Policies and Procedures \u00a7 30-002(z)(3).)</p>\n<p id=\"b166-10\">Petitioners contend that DSS\u2019s regulations have added an eligibility requirement that is not contained within the language of section 16504.1. They assert that the plain meaning of the statute is that \u201cemergency shelter care\u201d shall be provided to all homeless children, whether or not separated from their families.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-11\">In weighing these respective arguments, we start with the prescript that laws governing welfare programs are to be \u201cliberally interpreted and actively enforced.\u201d <em>(Robbins </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1985) 38 Cal.3d 199, 208 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>[211 Cal.Rptr. 398, 695 P.2d 695].); <em>County of Los Angeles </em>v. <em>Workers' Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1981) 30 Cal.3d 391, 401 [179 Cal.Rptr. 214, 637 P.2d 681].)  Thus, the term \u201cemergency shelter care,\u201d accorded its broad meaning, requires DSS to provide such care to homeless families.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">DSS is unable to cite legislative history or other indicia which suggest that the Legislature did not intend to provide emergency shelter care to homeless families. DSS calls our attention to the fact that child welfare services are available to families regardless of wealth. (\u00a7\u00a7 16504, 16506.) Thus, an abused child of affluent parents is entitled to protection afforded under this act. From this, DSS deduces that providing benefits to homeless families makes no sense, citing as its supporting example an hypothetical family which has been evicted from its home, but which has, nevertheless, the sum of $5,000 in the bank and an income of $2,000 per month.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">It is in no way apparent how, in actual practice, an hypothetical family of such financial means may be deemed to be in such economic straits as to present an \u201cemergency situation.\u201d Even under the most tortured of logic, such a family would fail to qualify for emergency shelter under the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">DSS also defends its regulation upon the theory that there is statutory language which indicates that the Legislature did not intend DSS to provide emergency shelter care to homeless families. Specifically, DSS alludes to the fact that emergency shelter care is available under two other components of the Child Welfare Services Program: Family Reunification (\u00a7 16507.1) and Permanent Placement. (\u00a7 16508.1.) Both of these components come into play after the child has been removed from his or her parents. It postulates that, where the same phrase is used more than once in a statutory scheme, it must be given the same meaning throughout. <em>(Alhambra Cons. Mines, Inc. </em>v. <em>Alhambra Shumway Mines, Inc. </em>(1966) 239 Cal.App.2d 590, 595 [49 Cal.Rptr. 38].) Thus, DSS deduces, in order for the term \u201cemergency shelter care,\u201d as set forth in section 16506.1, to have the same meaning throughout the scheme, the Legislature must have intended that emergency care be provided at the time that initial intake and crisis intervention occurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-9\">We are not persuaded by the DSS argument. Social services provided through the operation of the Family Reunification and Permanent Placement programs are expressly limited to children \u201cwho cannot safely remain at home.\u201d There is no such limitation contained in the statutory language governing the Preplacement Preventive Services component.  \u201cWhere a statute on a particular subject omits a particular provision, the inclusion of such a provision in another statute concerning a related matter indicates an intent that the provision is not applicable to the statute from which it was omitted.\u201d <em>(Marsh </em>v. <em>Edwards Theaters Circuit, Inc. </em>(1976) 64 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>Cal.App.3d 881, 891 [134 Cal.Rptr. 844].)  We conclude that the Legislature\u2019s failure to include similar limitation upon homeless children who are at risk, but still residing with their parents, is a manifestation of its intent that all children be intended beneficiaries of emergency shelter care.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">\u201cStatutes relating to the same subject must, wherever possible, be reconciled in order to retain their force.\u201d <em>(Mark F. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1987) 189 Cal.App.3d 206, 211 [234 Cal.Rptr. 388].) The DSS analysis fails to consider legislative intent manifest in the Child Welfare Services Act as well as California\u2019s overall legislative scheme governing the welfare of the youth of this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">As stated, one of the purposes of the enactment of the Child Welfare Services Act is to ensure that as few children as possible be ensnared in the foster care network. It is recognized by Congress that this goal may be best accomplished by providing, whenever feasible, child welfare services appropriate to the family, and that such services be rendered \u201cto prevent or eliminate the need for removal of the child from his home . . . .\u201d (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 671(15)(A); see also 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 625(a)(1)(C).)</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">It is widely recognized that children have strong emotional ties to even the \u201cworst\u201d of parents. (Goldstein, Freud &amp; Solnit, Beyond the Best Interests of the Child (1973) at pp. 19-20; Kay &amp; Phillips, <em>Poverty and the Law of Child Custody </em>(1966) 54 Cal.L.Rev. 717.) \u201cContinuity of relationships is extremely important to children. [Fn. omitted.] Removing a child from his family may cause serious psychological damage \u2014 damage more serious than the harm intervention is supposed to prevent. [Fn. omitted.]\u201d (Wald I, <em>supra, </em>27 Stan.L.Rev. at p. 994.)</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">Judicial intervention into the integrity of the family is neither a desirable nor a recommended disposition. (\u00a7 396; <em>In re Marriage of Mentry </em>(1983) 142 Cal.App.3d 260, 270 [190 Cal.Rptr. 843]; <em>In re Jeremy C., supra, </em>109 Cal.App.3d 384, 393 [167 Cal.Rptr. 283].) \u201cIt is now the prevailing ethic among child care experts that foster care has been overused as a means of protecting children. [Fn. omitted.] Although still widely used, foster care is considered generally to be a worse alternative than leaving a child in the home. . . .\u201d (Wald, <em>State Intervention on Behalf of \u201cNeglected Children\u201d: Standards for Removal of Children from Their Homes, Monitoring the Status of Children in Foster Care, and Termination of Parental Rights </em>(1976) 28 Stan.L.Rev. 625, 644.)</p>\n<p id=\"b168-8\">It is the purpose of the Juvenile Court Act that the bond between a minor and his or her family be \u201cpreserve[d] and strengthen[ed]\u201d (\u00a7 202) through the provision of appropriate services. (\u00a7 307, subd. (a).)  \u201cThe legisla<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>tive scheme contemplates immediate and intensive support services to reunify a family where a dependency disposition removes a child from parental custody.\u201d <em>(In re John B. </em>(1984) 159 Cal.App.3d 268, 274 [205 Cal.Rptr. 321]; see also \u00a7 361, subd. (b); Cal. Rules of Court, rule 1377(c).)</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">The preservation of the family unit is also an objective which courses throughout the body of California\u2019s laws governing the AFDC program. It is the often expressed intent of the Legislature that all reasonable efforts be made to prevent the unnecessary separation of children from their parents. \u201cFrom the outset AFDC has sought to provide for the financial needs of families with dependent children so that the children may remain in their home [sic]. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Vaessen </em>v. <em>Woods </em>(1984) 35 Cal.3d 749, 755 [200 Cal.Rptr. 893, 677 P.2d 1183].) The Legislature has recognized that \u201c. . . the family unit is of fundamental importance to society in nurturing its members, passing on values, averting potential social problems, and providing the secure structure in which citizens live out their lives. . . . Each family has the right and responsibility to provide sufficient support and protection of its children, to raise them according to its values and to provide every opportunity for educational and social progress.\u201d (\u00a7 11205.)</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">Section 10000 provides, in part, that the purpose of those laws governing the operation of public assistance programs \u201c. . . is to provide for protection, care, and assistance to the people of this state in need thereof, and to promote the welfare and happiness of all of the people of the state by providing appropriate aid and services to all of its needy and distressed. It is the legislative intent that aid shall be administered and services provided promptly and humanely, with due regard for the preservation of family life</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">The DSS regulation under review is subversive of these goals, in that its application has the actual potential of needlessly forcing homeless families into the clutches of child dependency proceedings, and thereby effecting the disintegration of families. For example, in order for its children to secure shelter, the homeless family is forced under present DSS regulations to choose between either remaining homeless, with family members together, or the placing of its children in foster care, with the attendant risk of permanent alienation of the child from his or her family. (E.g., see <em>In re Cheryl E. </em>(1984) 161 Cal.App.3d 587, 594-595 [207 Cal.Rptr. 728].)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>other instances, a family that is unable to secure \u201ca home or suitable place of abode\u201d runs the risk of having its children made subject to the jurisdiction of the juvenile court and, in many cases, of their being placed in foster care. (\u00a7 300, subd. (b); <em>In re Jack H. </em>(1980) 106 Cal.App.3d 257, 266 [165 Cal.Rptr. 646].)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">The plight of the homeless AFDC family often considerably worsens once their children are removed to foster care, in that the loss of AFDC eligibility follows the loss of custody. In the absence of appropriate assistance, parents in these circumstances become even less able to afford adequate housing than they were prior to the loss of their children. Consequently, what is intended to be temporary foster care due to the family\u2019s inability to secure housing, has been known to result in the permanent separation of parent from child.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">We find that the objective sought to be achieved by section 16504.1 is that of promoting the preservation and protection of the family unit.  It is obvious that a regulation that requires the removal of a child from his or her family in order to interpose social services with the ostensible purpose of providing shelter for such child, contradicts and subverts the primary purpose of our child welfare laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">DSS notes that family maintenance services are available in situations in which the child may remain in his or her \u201cown home.\u201d (\u00a7 16504.) It asserts that the language of this section suggests that the Legislature intended the statutes to apply in those instances in which the parents are able to provide shelter.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">Under section 16501.1, preplacement welfare services are intended to \u201cmaintain the child safely in his or her own home or to protect the safety of the child.\u201d There is no question that a homeless child is in perilous circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-9\">In winter, a homeless child may be exposed to the elements. The temporary quarters of the homeless family may, in all likelihood, lack adequate sanitation facilities, and thereby expose a child to disease and pestilence.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>For want of a stable home environment, a homeless child becomes a likely candidate for emotional trauma.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Homelessness makes it difficult for a child to attend school on a regular basis, if at all. (E.g., see <em>Delgado </em>v. <em>School Dist. </em>(1986) 131 Misc.2d 102 [499 N.Y.S.2d 606].)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> It is, therefore, our conclusion that child welfare services are to be provided in all instances in which it is reasonable to anticipate that the safety and well-being of the child are at risk, and that such services are to be provided without regard to whether the child has, or lacks, shelter.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">D. <em>Related Statutes Governing the Provision of Emergency Shelter to Children Demonstrates Legislative Concern That Emergency Shelter Be Provided to Homeless Families.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">The enactment of the Child Welfare Services Act must not be viewed as an isolated attempt by the California Legislature to enact a body of laws to protect homeless families. Our Legislature has a long history of enacting laws designed to insure that low income families are provided the opportunity to dwell in housing units which are both safe and adequate. It must be assumed that the Legislature was fully aware of these statutes at the time that it enacted the Child Welfare Act, and that the Legislature intended to maintain a consistent body of laws. <em>(Fuentes </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1976) 16 Cal.3d 1, 8 [128 Cal.Rptr. 673, 547 P.2d 449].)</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">The problem of homelessness is hardly a recent phenomenon. (See Malone, <em>Homelessness in a Modern Urban Setting, </em>10 Fordham Urb.L.J. 749, 750, fn. 4 (1982).) In California, our Legislature initially confronted the problem of homelessness during the New Deal era. In 1938, it enacted the Housing Authorities Law in an effort to provide safe housing for low-income individuals and families. (2 Deering\u2019s Gen. Laws Supp., Act 3483; repealed 1951.) The law was promptly attacked as being an illegal expenditure of public funds. The Supreme Court, in rejecting this challenge, made the following observation: \u201c. . . [I]t is our view, and we are satisfied that both reason and authority support us, that the proposed elimination of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>slums and the erection of safe and sanitary low-rent dwelling units for persons of the prescribed restricted income will do much to advance the public welfare and to protect the public safety and morals and are in fact and law public purposes.\u201d <em>(The Housing Authority </em>v. <em>Dockweiler </em>(1939) 14 Cal.2d 437, 450 [94 P.2d 794].)</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">In 1970, the Legislature again expressed its concern that the housing needs of low-income families were not being met. The Legislature found that \u201c. . . there continues to exist throughout the state a seriously inadequate supply of safe and sanitary dwelling accommodations for persons and families of low income. This condition is contrary to the public interest and threatens the health, safety, welfare, comfort and security of the people of this state.\u201d (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 33250; see also <em>Henrioulle </em>v. <em>Marin Ventures, Inc. </em>(1978) 20 Cal.3d 512, 519 [143 Cal.Rptr. 247, 573 P.2d 465].) It declared the federal policy (as set forth in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441), of \u201c. . . a decent home and a suitable living environment for every American family . . .\u201d to be a \u201cpriority of the highest order.\u201d (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 50002; see also former Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 37120 et seq., 42000, 41003, 41002, and 41004.)</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">With the intensification of social problems attending inadequate housing for families came the heightened concern of this state\u2019s lawmakers, as reflected in subsequent legislation. In 1977, it was declared that \u201c. . . there exists within the urban and rural areas of the state a serious shortage of decent, safe, and sanitary housing which persons and families of low or moderate income, including the elderly and handicapped, can afford.\u201d (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 50003.) The Legislature stated that it was a \u201c. . . public purpose to encourage the availability of adequate housing and home finance for persons and families of low or moderate income . . . .\u2019\u2019(Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 50004; see also <em>Knight </em>v. <em>Hallsthammar </em>(1981) 29 Cal.3d 46, 53, fn. 3 [171 Cal.Rptr. 707, 623 P.2d 268].)</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">Government Code section 65580, enacted in 1980, declares: \u201cThe availability of housing is of vital statewide importance, and the early attainment of decent housing and a suitable living environment for every California family is a priority of the highest order.\u201d California Administrative Code, title 25, section 6438, implementing Government Code section 65580, requires that county and cities examine the housing needs of large families, minority households, the elderly, and the handicapped.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-8\">Legislative concern notwithstanding, the plight of low and moderate income families in locating housing came to be of epidemic proportion as the decade of the 1970\u2019s drew to a close. (See <em>Marina Point, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Wolfson </em>(1982) 30 Cal.3d 721, 743 [180 Cal.Rptr. 496, 640 P.2d 115, 30 A.L.R.4th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>1161].)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>In 1980, the Legislature found to exist a . . severe shortage of affordable housing, especially for persons and families of low and moderate income . . . (Gov. Code, \u00a7 65913.)</p>\n<p id=\"b173-4\">In 1984, the Legislature made the determination that, \u201c. . . because of economic, physical, and mental conditions that are beyond their control, thousands of individuals and families in California are homeless. Churches, local governments, and nonprofit organizations providing assistance to the homeless have been overwhelmed by a new class of homeless: families with children . . . .\u2019\u2019(Stats. 1984, ch. 1691.) The shortage of housing was found to be \u201cinimical to the health, safety, and welfare of the residents of this state and sound growth of its communities.\u201d (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 50003.3.) The Legislature concluded it to be of \u201cvital statewide importance\u201d that an emergency fund be created to supplement temporary shelter progams for homeless families. <em>{Ibid.-, </em>see also Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 50001, subd. (b).)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> It declared that, in order to remedy the problem, it is necessary to make the \u201c[mjaximum utilization of state, local, and federal subsidies available to meet the emergency shelter needs of the homeless.\u201d (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 50003.3, subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">The use of the Child Welfare Services program to help homeless families to obtain decent emergency shelter is appropriate under state and federal law. Such action is in keeping with the notion that our public social service programs humanely provide for the needs of families with dependent children. (\u00a7 10000; <em>Robbins </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>39 Cal.3d at pp. 208-209.)</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">It has been estimated that there are approximately between two and three million homeless individuals in this nation. <em>(Clark </em>v. <em>Community for Creative Non-violence </em>(1984) (Marshall dissenting) 468 U.S. 288 , fn. 4 [82 L.Ed2d 221, 233, 104 S.Ct. 3065]; New York <em>Times, </em>May 2, 1984, at p. 1.) A recent study conducted by the United States Conference of Mayors reported that 28 percent of the homeless are families with children. (The Continued Growth of Hunger, Homelessness, and Poverty in America\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>Cities: (1986) p. 2.) \u201cBy far, the most significant change in the cities\u2019 homeless population has been in the number of families with children, with four out of five of the survey cities reporting that the number of families seeking emergency shelter has grown. In seventy-two percent of the cities, families comprise the largest group for whom emergency shelter and other needed services are particularly lacking.\u201d <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">We conclude that, in view of the Legislature\u2019s repeated manifestation of concern for the dire shortage of housing for low-income families, \u201cemergency shelter,\u201d as stated in section 16504.1, must be given a broad meaning. DSS\u2019s narrow interpretation of this provision would render meaningless a major component of this state\u2019s program of child welfare services.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">Our society can ill afford to ignore the alarming plight of our homeless population. <em>(Collier </em>v. <em>Menzel </em>(1985) 176 Cal.App.3d 24, 36 [221 Cal.Rptr. 110].) This admonition is especially true with respect to the needs of homeless children. \u201cAn administration of the welfare program that discards statutory mandate to reduce relief to the indigent young cannot be sustained. A society that sacrifices the health and well-being of its young upon the false altar of economy endangers its own future, and, indeed, its own survival.\u201d <em>(Cooper </em>v. <em>Swoap, supra, </em>11 Cal.3d 856, 872-873 [115 Cal.Rptr. 1, 524 P.2d 97].) The California Legislature has enacted a body of law designed to render assistance to homeless families. It is our obligation as a court to ensure that these measures be actively and humanely enforced. <em>(Cooper </em>v. <em>Swoap, supra, </em>11 Cal.3d at p. 864.) DSS must act not only in a manner consistent with the intent and purpose of this legislation, but must act with the reasonable understanding of the practical demands of the circumstances with which individual homeless families are faced.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-8\">DSS\u2019s interpretation of section 16504.1 not only flies in the face of the provision\u2019s clear language <em>(Lister </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1979) 98 Cal.App.3d 64 [159 Cal.Rptr. 280]), it also runs counter to the objective of federal and state child welfare services legislation that social services be provided in such manner as to prevent the unnecessary separation of children from their families. (42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 625(a)(1)(C); 671(15)(A); 16501.1, subd. (b).) Moreover, DSS\u2019s interpretation disregards well-settled prescript that laws governing public social service programs be liberally construed to effect the stated objects and purposes of the program. <em>(Robbins </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>38 Cal.3d at pp. 208-209.)</p>\n<p id=\"b174-9\">In <em>Hansen </em>v. <em>Department of Social Services, </em>case number B021106, we find the trial court\u2019s order, enjoining DSS from defining emergency shelter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>care \u201cso as to exclude homeless children, regardless of whether homeless children remain with their parent(s), guardian(s), or caretaker(s),\u201d to be consistent with the Legislature\u2019s clear and express statewide policy to meet, when reasonably possible, the housing needs of low-income families. The order granting the preliminary injunction is affirmed.</p>\n<otherdate id=\"AUk\">A petition for a rehearing was denied July 28, 1987, and the opinion was modified to read as printed above.

Declaratory relief may be granted where the complaint states sufficient facts to support such relief, even though the pleader did not seek such relief in his complaint. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7\u00a7 580, 1060; <em>Bank of America etc. Assn. </em>v. <em>Gillett </em>(1940) 36 Cal.App.2d 453, 455 [97 P.2d 875]; 5 Witkin, Cal.
