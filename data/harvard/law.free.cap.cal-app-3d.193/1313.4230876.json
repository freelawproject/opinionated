Proc., \u00a7 409.1)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the plaintiff prevails in the underlying lawsuit solely on one or more causes of action that would <em>not </em>support the recordation of a lis pendens, may the plaintiff satisfy the judgment out of the proceeds of the undertaking?  We conclude that a plaintiff may not do so and therefore reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment enforcing liability on the bond<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (\u00a7 996.440).</p>\n<p id=\"b859-5\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b859-6\">In July 1979, Charles Hill and Paul Elder entered into a written option agreement (hereafter the Hill-Elder option) whereby Elder obtained the exclusive right to purchase certain real property (hereafter the Agoura property) owned by Hill. Charles Hill\u2019s wife, Dorothy, became a party to the Hill-Elder option on December 9, 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-7\">On January 8, 1981, Agoura Investment Company (hereafter Agoura), a general partnership consisting of Elder and Jack Barnes, and Larwin Construction Company (hereafter Larwin) entered into a written option agreement whereby Larwin obtained the right to purchase the property rights held by Elder under the Hill-Elder option.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-8\">A joint complaint filed on August 14, 1981, by Elder, Barnes, Agoura, and Larwin (hereafter collectively referred to as plaintiffs), alleged that, despite Elder\u2019s valid exercise of his option to purchase the Agoura property, the Hills conveyed legal title to the Agoura property to General Software, Inc. (hereafter General). A lis pendens was recorded concurrently with the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-9\">On November 13, 1981, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint against the Hills and General (hereafter collectively referred to as defendants) for specific performance, breach of contract, declaratory relief, constructive trust, quiet title, and fraud. Various cross-complaints not pertinent to this appeal were filed by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-10\">On August 26, 1982, defendants filed a motion to expunge the lis pendens or, in the alternative, to require plaintiffs to give an undertaking pursuant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1316\">*1316</page-number>section 409.1. The trial court concluded that plaintiffs failed to demonstrate they commenced or prosecuted the action for a proper purpose and in good faith and granted the motion to expunge on the condition that defendants give a corporate surety bond in the amount of $200,000.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Carlisle Insurance Company (hereafter Carlisle), the appellant herein, issued the corporate surety bond on behalf of defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-4\">After the motion to expunge the lis pendens was granted, Elder, Barnes, and Agoura, only, filed a second amended complaint on March 11, 1983, seeking various judicial determinations, including \u201ca declaration that Elder and Agoura are no longer obligated to pursue the remedy of specific performance against the Hills pursuant to the Larwin Agreement . . . [and] a declaration that Plaintiffs are entitled to restitution of all sums expended by them in connection with the improvements on the [Agoura property].\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">On April 7, 1983, Larwin separately filed a second amended complaint for breach of contract, breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, unjust enrichment, quasi contract, and equitable lien based, in part, on the above mentioned improvements made to the Agoura property.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-6\">On September 9, 1983, defendants filed a motion to remove the requirement of a corporate surety bond on the ground that plaintiffs\u2019 second amended complaints no longer stated causes of action that could properly support the recordation of a lis pendens. This motion was denied on October 4, 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-7\">On January 23, 1985, judgment was rendered against defendants and in favor of Larwin in the amount of $300,000 plus costs, and in favor of Elder, Barnes, and Agoura in the amount of $175,000 plus costs. The basis of the judgment was unjust enrichment. No appeal was taken from the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-8\">On June 17, 1985, Elder, Barnes, and Agoura filed a motion to enforce liability on the corporate surety bond issued by Carlisle. A similar motion was filed by Larwin on July 10, 1985.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1317\">*1317</page-number>On September 11, 1985, the trial court granted both motions and entered judgment pursuant to section 996.440, subdivision (d), in favor of Larwin in the sum of $126,034.43 plus interest and attorneys\u2019 fees and in favor of Elder, Barnes, and Agoura in the sum of $73,965.57 plus interest and attorneys\u2019 fees. It is from this judgment that Carlisle appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b861-6\">.......<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b861-7\">B.  Does an undertaking given pursuant to section 409.1 protect against damages which do not result from the expungement of the lis pendens?</p>\n<p id=\"b861-8\">1. History of section 409.1<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b861-9\">The history of section 409.1 was detailed in <em>Malcolm </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1981) 29 Cal.3d 518, 524-525 [174 Cal.Rptr. 694, 629 P.2d 495], as follows: \u201cThe Legislature enacted section 409.1 in 1968 in an attempt to alleviate problems which had arisen from the misuse of notices of lis pendens. [Citation.] Prior to 1968, as now, section 409 permitted any plaintiff who had filed a lawsuit claiming an interest in real property to record a notice of lis pendens without prior court approval or supervision. Because the recording of a lis pendens placed a cloud upon the title of real property until the pending action was ultimately resolved, a time period frequently encompassing several years, the lis pendens procedure was susceptible to serious abuse, providing unscrupulous plaintiffs with a powerful lever to force the settlement of groundless or malicious suits. [Citations.]</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1318\">*1318</page-number>\u201cBefore the enactment of the expungement legislation in 1968 there was no meaningful prejudgment procedure either to identify those instances in which the lis pendens remedy was being abused or to alleviate the potential harm caused by such abuse. The Legislature adopted section 409.1 et seq. to afford such a remedy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-4\">\u201cAs originally enacted in 1968, section 409.1 provided for the prejudgment expungement of a lis pendens if the party seeking expungement could demonstrate \u2018by clear and convincing proof that, inter alia, the person recording the lis pendens had commenced the action \u2018for an improper purpose and not in good faith.\u2019 (Stats. 1968, ch. 815, \u00a7 1, p. 1572.) Although this initial version of the statute provided some relief from the problems that had engendered the provision\u2019s enactment, after several years the provision began to draw serious criticism as commentators noted that the statute placed on the party seeking expungement a burden of proof which was so difficult to carry that a motion to expunge could succeed in only the most flagrant cases of abuse. [Citation.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-5\">\u201cIn response to such criticism, the Legislature in 1976 amended section 409.1 in two significant respects. (Stats. 1976, ch. 27, \u00a7 1, pp. 42-43.) First, the Legislature transferred the burden of proof or persuasion from the party seeking to expunge the lis pendens to the party opposing the motion to expunge; thus, whereas the 1968 statute placed the burden on the party seeking expungement to demonstrate that the underlying action had been brought for an improper purpose and not in good faith, the present provision requires the party who has filed the lis pendens to show to the satisfaction of the court that he has commenced or prosecuted the action for a proper purpose and in good faith. Second, the Legislature altered the quantum of proof necessary to justify the expungement of the lis pendens; whereas the 1968 statute had authorized expungement only when the court was satisfied by \u2018clear and convincing proof that the action had been brought, inter alia, for an improper purpose or not in good faith, the 1976 amendment lowered the threshold of proof that is needed to support a ruling in favor of expungement, providing for expungement whenever the trial court is not convinced by a \u2018preponderance of the evidence\u2019 that the action had been commenced for a proper purpose and in good faith.\u201d (Italics omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b862-6\">2. Interpretation</p>\n<p id=\"b862-7\">Plaintiffs assert that the language used in section 409.1 (i.e., \u201csuch undertaking to be to the effect that . . . [the party prevailing on the expungement motion] will indemnify the other party for all damages which he may incur if he ultimately prevails in the [underlying] action\u201d) is clear in meaning and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1319\">*1319</page-number>encompasses all monetary relief awarded in the underlying action. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">Plaintiffs\u2019 proposed interpretation of section 409.1 would permit a party who obtained a judgment solely on a cause of action that would not support the recordation of a lis pendens to satisfy that judgment out of the undertaking given as a condition of expungement of the lis pendens. As a result, a party who improperly recorded a lis pendens and then became the beneficiary of an undertaking ordered as a condition of its expungement would be in a better position than a party who properly refrained from recording an unjustified lis pendens. It is thus apparent that plaintiffs\u2019 interpretation of section 409.1 is illogical and would lend itself to the type of abuse that led to the creation of the expungement statutes in the first place.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-6\">In construing a statute, a court should give meaning to the entire statute and avoid an interpretation that would effectively nullify a portion of the statute. (\u00a7 1858; <em>Moyer </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1973) 10 Cal.3d 222, 230 [110 Cal.Rptr 144, 514 P.2d 1224]; <em>Carleson </em>v. <em>Unemployment Ins. Appeals Bd. </em>(1976) 64 Cal.App.3d 145, 155-156 [134 Cal.Rptr. 278].) However, the interpretation proposed by plaintiffs would render meaningless that portion of section 409.1 which permits a trial court to require the party recording the lis pendens to give an undertaking as a condition of nonexpungement. In such a situation, the property owner who prevailed in the underlying action would obtain a judgment in his favor but would not be awarded \u201cdamages\u201d as that term is used in section 409.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-7\"> The only interpretation of section 409.1 which gives meaning to all of the language contained in the statute and avoids unfair results is that an undertaking given as a condition of expungement or nonexpungement of a lis pendens serves to protect only against damages that actually result from the expungement or nonexpungement.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b863-8\">It necessarily follows that a party who is given an undertaking as a condition of the expungement of a lis pendens pursuant to section 409.1 and who prevails in the underlying action solely on a cause of action that does not support the recordation of a lis pendens, may not satisfy that judgment out of the undertaking.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1320\">*1320</page-number>3. Application</p>\n<p id=\"b864-4\">In the case at bench, judgment in the underlying action was rendered on the basis of unjust enrichment for improvements made to the Agoura property. Since a cause of action for unjust enrichment does not support the recordation of a lis pendens,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the trial court erred in permitting plaintiffs to satisfy the judgment out of the undertaking.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b864-6\">The judgment enforcing liability on the bond given pursuant to section 409.1 is reversed.
