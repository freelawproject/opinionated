Plaintiff appeals. It was averred in the indictment that a verified complaint was filed in the superior court of -San Diego county wherein one John Long was plaintiff and R. A. Jones, the defendant here, was defendant; Long sought judgment that Jones held the legal title to certain lots in trust for Dong and to compel conveyance thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">It was alleged in the indictment, as in Long\u2019s duly verified complaint in his suit against Jones, that one Kampling and wife conveyed certain lots to Long \u201cpursuant to a sale of the said premises from said\u201d Kampling and wife, \u201cas vendors, to said John Long, as vendee, negotiated by the defendant, R. A. Jones, acting as the agent, of said Kampling and wife; that in consideration of part of the purchase price of said property so sold by said Kampling and wife, through said R. A. Jones, as their agent, to said John Long .... the said Long conveyed to said R. A. Jones\u201d certain lots, which Long was induced to do \u201cupon the representation that he, the said Jones, would hold the same in trust\u201d for said Kampling and wife, \u201cand would convey the same to said Mrs. Kampling.\u201d It was alleged also that Kampling and wife were ignorant of the fact that Jones had procured said conveyance to be made to him by Long in part consideration of the selling price of the property conveyed by Kampling and wife to Long; that Jones paid no consideration for the lots deeded to him by Long, and concealed from Kampling and wife that he had acquired this property from Long; that Kampling and wife Lad conveyed to Long all their interest in the property conveyed to Jones by Long, and that the latter is now the owner thereof. The perjury complained of is in the verified answer filed by Jones to Long\u2019s complaint, in which the indictment charges that Jones deposed as follows: \u201cThat he, the said defendant R. A. Jones, did not in the property trade between B. Kampling and Emma Kampling and the plaintiff, the said John Long, .... act as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>agent for said B. Kampling and Emma Kampling, or either of them. That in and about the exchange of the properties .... he, the said defendant, acted as the factor or intermediator of both parties\u2014that is to say, he brought the parties together and. let them do their own trading.\u201d Allegations follow that the action was tried on the issues formed by said complaint and answer,, that defendant knew that said matter above set forth as in the-answer was false \u201cand was matter material to the issue in said cause,\u201d et cetera.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">Despondent contends that, if the matter specifically set forth in the indictment as constituting the alleged perjury could in any event have been material, it affirmatively appears upon the face of the indictment that in the complaint in the case of <em>Long v. Jones </em>there was no direct allegation that Jones was the agent,, or acted as the agent, of the Kamplings, but such agency is alleged by way of recital only, if alleged at all. If it was material' to Long\u2019s complaint that he should clearly allege that Jones was. the agent of the Kamplings, and as such agent negotiated the-transfer alleged, the complaint, so far as set out in the indictment, failed to do so, and of course the indictment, which recites, the allegations of the complaint, also failed in that particular. There was, therefore, no material issue tendered as to Jones\u2019\" agency. Direct and positive averments of the fact cannot be supplied by any intendment or implication, and where stated argumentatively or by way of recital or inference it is insufficient. <em>(People v. Dunlap, </em>113 Cal. 72.) This rule applies even to civil actions. <em>(Denver v. Burton, </em>28 Cal. 549; <em>Stringer v. Davis, </em>30 Cal. 318.) But, aside from this view of the matter, we cannot-regard the answer of defendant as constituting perjury. He averred that he did not act as agent of the Kamplings in the property trade referred to, but that he \u201cacted as the factor or intermediator of both parties\u2014that is to say, he brought the parties together and let them do their own trading.\u201d It seems to-us that defendant should have been permitted to make such an answer without subjecting himself to the charge of perjury. Whether he was acting as \u201cagent\u201d or \u201cintermediator\u201d does notiseem to be material to his liability as a trustee, because it was alleged that he took the title and agreed to hold the property \u201cin trust for said Kampling and wife, and would convey the same-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>to said Mrs. Emma Kampling.\u201d which does not appear to have been denied by defendant. He was equally liable as trustee whether he acted as agent, factor, or mediator under the allegations of the complaint, for he was charged with having received the title without consideration and as trustee. The false oath must be material to the issue and therefore prejudicial to some one, otherwise, however willful, it cannot be perjury. <em>(People v. McDermott, </em>8 Cal. 288.) In the case just cited, the defendant denied by verified answer the note sued upon because, as he alleged, \u201che was confident that the words \u2018value received\u2019 were not in the note when he made it.\u201d The court held that the answer showed that the denial was made upon the ground that the words \u201cvalue received\u201d were not in the note he had signed. It was said that a very different question would have been presented if he had simply denied that the note was his. But he gave the reason for his denial, which, if true, did not change the effect of the instrument; it was immaterial, and therefore did not prejudice the plaintiff. So here the denial of the agency and admitting that he acted as factor or mediator did not place Long in a worse nor Jones in any better position. \u201cAn agent is one who represents another, called the principal, in dealings with third persons.\u201d (Civ. Code, sec. 2295.) Section 2297 declares that \u201can agent for a particular act or transaction is called a special agent.\u201d It seems to us that defendant might deny that he was the \u201cagent\u201d and allege the exact relation in which he acted, because the allegation presented a question of mixed law and fact as to the kind of agency alleged, as well also whether there was any agency at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">The judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">Haynes, C., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">For the reasons given in the foregoing opinion the judgment is affirmed.
