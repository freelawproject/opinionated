Hancock, are the sole heirs of said deceased. The policies purported, respectively, to insure \u201cthe estate of Samuel Hancock, deceased,\u201d against loss on the several buildings described; there was evidence that they were issued on the procurement of defendant and were delivered to him; neither himself nor the administratrix was named personally in the instruments, and she repudiated any concern therein. Defendant claims that the policies are not contracts of his, that they do not insure his interest in the property, and hence that he ought not to he liable for the premium. There was a verdict and judgment for plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-9\">We see no difficulty in the case. The phrase \u201cEstate of Samuel Hancock, deceased,\u201d used in the policies to describe the party or parties insured, was sufficient to extend the protection of the insurance to the interest of defendant as well as those of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>administratrix in the property. <em>(Clinton v. Hope Ins. Co., </em>45 N. Y. 454; <em>Weed v. Hamburg-Bremen Ins. Co., </em>133 N. Y. 394; <em>Fire Ins. Assn. v. Transportation Co., </em>66 Md. 339; 59 Am. Rep. 162; <em>The Sydney, </em>27 Fed. Rep. 125; compare Civ. Code, sec. 2591.) Although defendant had no authority to procure insurance for the administratrix, yet she could have ratified his act\u2014even after the occurrence of a loss <em>(Hooper v. Robinson, </em>98 U. S. 528); that she did not do so, hut declined any interest in the policies, could <em>not </em>impair their effect as insurance upon defendant\u2019s interest in the property, nor affect his liability for the premium. <em>(Finney v. Fairhaven Ins. Co., </em>5 Met. 192, 196; 38 Am. Dec. 397.) The judgment and order denying a new trial should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">Searls, C., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">For the reasons given in the foregoing opinion the judgment and order denying a new trial are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">Garoutte, J., Harrison, J., Van Fleet, J.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
