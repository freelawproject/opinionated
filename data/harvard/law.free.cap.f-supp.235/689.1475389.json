The Commission held in Dealers Transit, Inc., Extension \u2014 Missiles, 86 M.C.C. 327, and Baggett Transportation Co., Extension\u2014 Redstone Arsenal, 88 M.C.C. 3, that plaintiff\u2019s certificate authorizing the transportation of \u201caircraft * * * and aircraft parts, restricted to parts requiring special equipment or handling by reason of size, weight, or fragile character\u201d, does not authorize the transportation of missiles and missile parts. Plaintiff also seeks a plenary hearing before the Commission to determine the issue of whether or not its certificate includes authority to transport missiles and missile parts. Pursuant to a temporary restraining order issued by this Court, the effective date of the ICC\u2019s orders was postponed pending completion of this review proceeding. Thereafter, a three-judge court was designated under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2284 as required by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2325.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b743-26\">Dealers Transit, supra, involved applications by a number of motor carriers, including plaintiff, for authority to transport missiles, space vehicles, space satellites and parts thereof, and related items. One of these motor carriers was Leonard Bros. Transfer and Storage Co., Inc. At the consolidated hearing, plaintiff moved to dismiss its application on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>the ground its certificate authorizes transportation of commodities sought by its application. Leonard Bros. Transfer and Storage Co., Inc. made a similar motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\">The hearing examiner found that plaintiff possessed authority under its certificate to transport \u201cthe missile itself\u201d, but that it does not hold authority to transport the accompanying parts except to the extent they require special equipment. The hearing examiner found that no applicant possessed the authority to perform all the required service and recommended that Leonard Bros. Transfer and Storage Co., Inc.\u2019s authority be extended to permit it to transport missiles and missile parts and that the other applicants be found not to have such authority under their certificates. The ICC accepted the examiner\u2019s recommendation with regard to granting Leonard\u2019s application and denying others but held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-5\">\u201cWe see no point in extending the ordinary meaning of the word \u2018airplane\u2019 or \u2018aircraft\u2019 so as to hold that a missile is either, and thus we conclude that neither Leonard nor U.S. A.C. hold a part or all of the required authority.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">Plaintiff\u2019s petition for further hearing on the interpretation issue was denied. We should point out that plaintiff does not attack the grant of authority by the ICC to Leonard.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-7\">Complaint proceedings were instituted against plaintiff in Baggett, supra, on the ground it was transporting jet thrust units used in missiles without authority. The hearing examiners found \u201caircraft\u201d includes missiles. Division 1 of the Commission, citing Dealers Transit, reversed the examiners\u2019 finding. The ICC, en banc, denied reconsideration of the Division 1 report and order.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-8\">Plaintiff\u2019s contentions in substance are two: (1) The ICC\u2019s interpretation of its certificate has no rational basis; and (2) it has been denied a plenary hearing on the interpretation issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-13\">1. <em>Rational basis of ICC\u2019s finding. </em>Unless clearly erroneous, the ICC\u2019s interpretation of a certificate of its own creation is binding on the courts.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, plaintiff contends the action of the ICC, in interpreting its certificate, amounts to modification in violation of 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 312(a). That restrictions placed upon modification may not be bypassed under guise of interpretation is well established. However, as stated in Andrew G. Nelson, Inc. v. United States, 355 U.S. 554, 558-559, 78 S.Ct. 496, 499, 2 L.Ed.2d 484 (footnote 4):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-15\">\u201cCommission interpretation of the meaning of a permit, being simply a definitive declaration of what rights existed from the very beginning under the permit, cannot be equated with modification, however, unless found to be clearly erroneous.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b744-16\">Plaintiff contends the ICC\u2019s interpretation is clearly erroneous since it is contrary to the weight of evidence. True, the ICC\u2019s finding is contrary to uncontradicted expert testimony as to the meaning the disputed terms have in industry. However, it is within the discretionary power of the Commission to determine the weight to be accorded testimony of witnesses.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Moreover, evidence of industry usage lost its significance when the Commission, exercising expertise in matters of transportation, concluded no good reason was advanced why ordinary meaning of words should be varied for transportation purposes. Determination of whether words are used in accordance with ordinary or industry meaning involves exercise of administrative judgment. Any reasonable standard may be utilized since no criteria with which the Commission must comply in interpreting certificates of its own creation is set forth in the Interstate Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>-meree Act.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Examination of the record \u2022 convinces us the ICC\u2019s decision to use \u2022ordinary meaning and its determination .as to the meaning the terms have in \u25a0ordinary usage are sustainable on the reasoning contained in its report.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> That ..some missiles may possess characteristics .associated with aircraft is without significance since the ICC based its findings \u2022 on ordinary understanding rather than scientific distinctions.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b745-7\"> The ICC erred, according to \u2022plaintiff, in construing its authority contrary: (1) to examiners\u2019 recommendations; (2) to an informal ruling; and, (3) to a formal ruling in Leonard Bros. \u2018Transfer and Storage Co., Inc., Extension-Airplane Parts, No. M.C.-19227 (Sub. No. 49). That the ICC is not re- \u2022 quired to accept examiners\u2019 recommendations<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> nor informal opinions expressed by one of its employees<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> has long been recognized. Leonard involved an appli- - cation to transport crated airplane parts .and crated airplane supplies, machinery -and equipment. Plaintiff contends its right to transport missiles was recog\u25a0nized by virtue of Leonard\u2019s application having been denied. Although denial of Leonard\u2019s application was based in part upon existence of plaintiff\u2019s authority, we are not convinced plaintiff's right to transport missiles was recognized in view of its certificate not being in issue and missile traffic being a minor consideration in the case. Moreover, the ICC, being an administrative body, is not bound by stare decisis and inconsistency in its decisions does not in and of itself render them unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-17\">The ICC\u2019s consideration of intended meaning of the terms in plaintiff\u2019s certificate was not clearly erroneous notwithstanding absence of patent ambiguity in the commodity description. The record indicates the ICC\u2019s ultimate decision was based upon an independent interpretation of the words and subsequent reference to intent was only to strengthen the Commission\u2019s conclusion.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b745-18\">Nor do we believe the ICC abused its discretion in not giving industry transition from airplanes to missiles controlling weight and in not applying the \u201cfield of service\u201d doctrine. It is not an unusual practice of the ICC to authorize carriage of something less than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>entire output of an industry.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The definition of \"missile\u201d not having been in issue, it was not unreasonable for the ICC not to define that term. Whether missiles and missile parts are included in the commodity description \u201caircraft * * * and aircraft parts\u201d was the precise question before the Commission. If plaintiff in good- faith believes a particular commodity is an aircraft rather than a missile, it may carry the commodity until advised to the contrary. If in doubt, plaintiff may apply to the ICC for an opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">Since we conclude the ICC\u2019s interpretation of the commodity description in plaintiff\u2019s certificate is not clearly eri'oneous, the interpretation is but a definitive declaration of what x-ights plaintiff had from the beginning and in no way constitutes modification.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">2. <em>Plenary Hearing. </em>We do not x'each the constitutional question whether a hearing is required in \u201cinterpretation\u201d as opposed to \u201cmodification\u201d proceedings, for we find plaintiff was in fact accorded a full and fair hearing. The procedux\u2019e utilized by plaintiff in Dealers Transit, i. e., filing an application coupled with a motion to dismiss on the ground its certificate authorizes transportation of missiles and missile parts, is a method of obtaining in a plenary proceeding interpretation of operating authority.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The hearing examiner\u2019s failure to render an express ruling on the motion is without legal significance, since the ruling was implicit in its finding for plaintiff on the interpretation issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-11\">Although the particular commodity described in Dealers Transit was the Atlas missile, the ICC did not err in concluding plaintiff could not \u201cgenerally\u201d transport missiles. Examination of the record demonstrates all parties from commencement of proceedings recognized the Commission would determine the broad issue of whether \u201caircraft\u201d includes missiles.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-12\">The ICC\u2019s conclusion \u201c * * * no sufficient cause appears for reopening the (Dealers Tx*ansit) proceedings for x*eeonsideration, oral argument, or further hearing\u201d was not an abuse of discretion. Plaintiff presented no satisfactory explanation for its failure to adduce \u201cadditional evidence\u201d of technological similarities between missiles and aircraft at the original hearing. Moreover, it is not probable additional evidence of technological matters would have affected the ultimate decision since the ICC decided the words in the commodity description were used in accordance with their ordinary meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-13\">The ICC\u2019s reliance upon its prior interpretative x-uling in Dealers Transit in deciding Baggett was not improper, since the prior ruling is not lacking in rational basis and was rendered in a full and fair hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-14\">The permanent injunction sought by plaintiff will be denied, the temporary restraining order entered by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>this Court vacated, and the complaint dismissed. This Court under the circumstances at bar may review the action of the Commission only on the record which was before the Commission. It follows that the motion of the intervening defendants to strike the affidavits appended to plaintiff\u2019s original complaint will be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-4\">The plaintiff\u2019s prayers will be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">Appropriate orders may be submitted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b743-16\">.

Plaintiff, citing Nelson, supra, argues plain or ordinary meanings of words in a commodity description will not be resorted to if there is any indication of specialized usage in trade.

The fact remains that many different and vital parts are used in the manufacture of a television set than in a radio set, and that the completed television set produces both sound and picture effects whereas a radio set produces only sound. These differences are matters of common knowledge with which we are personally familiar, and which, therefore, strengthen us in our conclusion that television sets are different from radio sets.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b745-20\">.

Neither the fact that a large percentage of the parts of a radio are interchangeable with a television set nor the fact that a radio may be a component part of a television set justifies defendants\u2019 contention. Furthermore the fact that radios and televisions are produced by the same industry is likewise not determinative, because it is normal for the same industry to manufacture or assemble its finished products from the same general line of materials and parts.
