Potts was sentenced in September 2003 to 200 months of imprisonment for possession with intent to distribute at least five grams of crack cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). Even though he was sentenced as a career offender, Potts contends that he is entitled to a sentence reduction because his base offense level was lowered by Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines. After careful review, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s legal conclusions about the scope of its authority under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1326 (11th Cir.2008). We review the denial of a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217, 1219 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam). A district court has the authority to reduce a sentence based on a guideline imprisonment range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Amendment 706, effective retroactively as of 3 March 2008, permits a two-level reduction in the base offense levels under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c) for certain crack cocaine offenses. <em>See Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1325. Amendment 706 does not affect the guideline ranges of defendants sentenced as career offenders under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, however. <em>See id. </em>at 1330. Accordingly, even though Amendment 706 may reduce a defendant\u2019s base offense level under \u00a7 2Dl.l(c), a defendant is not entitled to a sentence reduction if he is sentenced as a career offender under \u00a7 4B1.1. <em>See id. </em>at 1330. Accordingly, even though Amendment 706 may reduce a defendant\u2019s base offense level under \u00a7 2Dl.l(c), a defendant is not entitled to a sentence reduction if he is sentenced as a career offender under \u00a7 4B1.1. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b241-8\"><em>Moore </em>controls the outcome of this case. Potts was sentenced as a career offender under \u00a7 4B1.1 which yielded an offense level of 34. He was awarded a three-level downward adjustment for timely accepting responsibility and assisting authorities in the investigation or prosecution, resulting in a total offense level of 31. His offense level under the career offender section applied because it was greater than his base offense level of 28 under \u00a7 2D1.1. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(b) (providing that \u201cif the offense level for a career offender ... is greater than the offense level otherwise applicable, the offense level from the table in this subsection shall apply\u201d). Even though Amendment 706 would reduce Potts\u2019s base offense level under \u00a7 2D1.1 from 28 to 26, his guideline sentencing range would remain the same under the career offender provision. Thus, because Amendment 706 had no effect on Potts\u2019s sentencing range, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) did not authorize a sentence reduction. <em>See Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1330.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-9\">Potts argues that an exception to <em>Moore </em>applies here. He points to a footnote in <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 985 n. 2 (11th Cir.2008) (per curiam), in which we acknowledged that \u201cAmendment 706 could apply to the sentence of an armed career criminal\u201d where \u201c \u00a7 2Dl.l(c) was applied at the original sentencing for an armed career criminal because it produced the highest offense level among the relevant calculations in \u00a7 4B1.4(b).\u201d As Potts concedes, he was not sentenced as an armed career criminal. Equally important, his base offense level under \u00a7 2Dl.l(c) was not applied at his original sentencing because he had a greater offense level under the career offender provision. The exception noted in <em>James </em>is therefore inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>For these reasons, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s denial of Potts\u2019s motion for sentence reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-3\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
