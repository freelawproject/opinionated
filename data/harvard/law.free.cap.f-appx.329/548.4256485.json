He was sentenced to 66 months of imprisonment and three years of supervised release. More than six months after judgment was entered, Martinez filed a notice of appeal. The district court construed Martinez\u2019s notice of appeal as a request for leave to file an out-of-time appeal and denied it.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-10\">The Federal Public Defender (FPD) appointed to represent Martinez on appeal has filed an ex parte motion to withdraw. In response, Martinez has requested the appointment of counsel to represent him on appeal. Martinez did not file a notice of appeal within 10 days after entry of the criminal judgment, <em>see </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(1)(A), or within the 30-day window for extending the time to appeal under Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(4). In light of the district court\u2019s enforcement of the time limitations in Rule 4, the untimeliness of the notice of appeal may not be disregarded. <em>See United States v. Leijano-Cruz, </em>473 F.3d 571, 574 (5th Cir.2006). Because the appeal is untimely and without arguable merit, the FPD\u2019s motion to withdraw is granted, Martinez\u2019s motion for the appointment of counsel is denied, and the appeal is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-15\">MOTIONS DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b579-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
