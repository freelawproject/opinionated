After review, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">Under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court may modify an already incarcerated defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment if the defendant\u2019s sentence was \u201cbased on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(o).\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(1). However, \u201c[wjhere a retroactively applicable guideline amendment reduces a defendant\u2019s base offense level, but does not alter the sentencing range upon which his or her sentence was based, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not authorize a reduction in sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1330 (11th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 965, 173 L.Ed.2d 156 (2009), <em>and </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 1601, 173 L.Ed.2d 689 (2009); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B). A reduction is not authorized if the amendment does not lower a defendant\u2019s applicable guidelines range \u201cbecause of the operation of another guideline or statutory provision.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 cmt. n. 1(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-10\">The district court did not err in denying Nettles a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction. Nettles\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion was based on Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines, which reduced most of the base offense levels in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c) applicable to crack cocaine offenses. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, amends. 706, 713. Nettles concedes that he was sentenced as a career offender. Thus, Nettles\u2019s offense level was based on U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, not on U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c). This Court concluded in <em>United States v. Moore </em>that a crack cocaine defendant, like Nettles, who was sentenced as a career offender under \u00a7 4B1.1 is not eligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction based on Amendment 706. <em>See </em>541 F.3d at 1327-29. Thus, the district court did not have authority to reduce Nettles\u2019s sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b288-25\">. In a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding, we review <em>de novo </em>the district court's legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1326 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
