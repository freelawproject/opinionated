Ratliff argues that the 262-month sentence imposed by the district court was unreasonable because it was based disproportionately on her criminal history and did not account for the minor role that she played in the conspiracy. Because Ratliffs plea agreement contained a waiver-of-appeal provision that waived her right to appeal any aspect of her sentence and because the rearraignment transcript shows that her waiver of appeal was knowing and voluntary, the instant appeal is barred. <em>See United States v. McKinney, </em>406 F.3d 744, 746-47 (5th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Bond, </em>414 F.3d 542, 544 (5th Cir.2005). The judgment of the district court is therefore AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b601-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
