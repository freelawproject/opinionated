After review, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b903-12\">Under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court may modify an already incarcerated defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment if the defendant\u2019s sentence was \u201cbased on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(o).\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(l). However, \u201c[w]here a retroactively applicable guideline amendment reduces a defendant\u2019s base offense level, but does not alter the sentencing range upon which his or her sentence was based, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not authorize a reduction in sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1330 (11th Cir.2008), cert. <em>denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 965, 173 L.Ed.2d 156 (2009), <em>and </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 1601, 173 L.Ed.2d 689 (2009); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B). A reduction is not authorized if the amendment does not lower a defendant\u2019s applicable guidelines range \u201cbecause of the operation of another guideline or statutory provision.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 cmt. n. 1(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b903-18\">Here, the district court did not err in denying Denson\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. Denson\u2019s \u00a7 3582(e)(2) motion was based on Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines, which reduced the base offense levels in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c) applicable to crack cocaine offenses. Because Denson was designated a career offender at his original sentencing, his offense level was based on U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, not on U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c). Thus, Amendment 706 had no effect on Denson\u2019s ultimate sentencing range. <em>See Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1327-29 (concluding that because Amendment 706 has no effect on the sentencing range of a defendant sentenced as a career offender pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, such a defendant is not eligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction).</p>\n<p id=\"b903-19\">Denson argues that the high pre-amendment crack cocaine offense levels in \u00a7 2D1.1 theoretically may have had some \u201cpassive effect\u201d on the final sentence the district court imposed. Denson notes that the district court denied his U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 motion for a downward departure at sentencing and, later, did not give him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>the full reduction he sought upon the government\u2019s substantial assistance motion filed pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35(b). Denson speculates that the outcome for each of these motions might have been different had Amendment 706 been in effect at the time. However, a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction is authorized only when an amendment actually lowers a defendant\u2019s applicable guidelines range. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(l) &amp; cmt. n. 1(A).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In Den-son\u2019s case, Amendment 706 did not change his applicable guidelines range. Thus, he was ineligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b903-13\">. \"We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b904-14\">. We reject Denson's interpretation of <em>Moore </em>that a defendant is eligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction any time the pre-amendment crack cocaine offense level may have \u201cplayed a role\u201d in the ultimate sentence selected by the district court. In dicta, <em>Moore </em>suggested a narrow exception to the general rule that a crack cocaine defendant sentenced as a career offender is ineligible for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief even when he received a downward departure. 541 F.3d at 1329-30. Specifically, <em>Moore </em>suggested that a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction was authorized when the defendant's downward departure was based on U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3(b) (overrepresented criminal history) and the sentencing court used the \"otherwise applicable guideline range\u201d derived from \u00a7 2D 1.1(c) as its frame of reference. <em>Id. </em>Den-son was not given a \u00a7 4A1.3 downward departure and thus would not fall <em>voider </em>the exception discussed in <em>Moore.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
