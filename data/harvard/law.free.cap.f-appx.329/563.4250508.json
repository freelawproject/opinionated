Mendoza argues that the evidence was insufficient to prove that he conspired to transport illegal aliens for private financial gain and that he transported illegal aliens for private financial gain. Because Mendoza failed to renew his motion for acquittal at the close of all evidence, he waived his objection to the trial court\u2019s earlier denial of his motion. <em>See United States v. Delgado, </em>256 F.3d 264, 274 (5th Cir.2001). In such a situation, this court\u2019s review is limited to determining whether the defendant\u2019s conviction \u201cresulted in a manifest miscarriage of justice,\u201d that is whether \u201cthe record is devoid of evidence pointing to guilt\u201d or whether \u201cthe evidence on a key element of the offense was so tenuous that a conviction would be shocking.\u201d <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>12 F.3d 1350, 1358 (5th Cir.1994). A review of the record indicates that there is sufficient evidence of guilt. Therefore, Mendoza has not shown that his conviction would result in a \u201cmanifest miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>See id. </em>Accordingly, Mendoza\u2019s conviction is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b593-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
