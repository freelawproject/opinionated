McChriston argues that he was eligible for a sentence reduction because his sentence was not based upon the statutorily enhanced minimum sentence in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841 (b) (1) (A) (iii), and that the district court should have- applied <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), in his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding to redetermine the amount of drugs for which he was responsible. After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-8\">A district court may modify a term of imprisonment in the case of a defendant who was sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that subsequently has been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Any reduction, however, must be \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The applicable policy statements, found in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, provide that a sentence reduction is not authorized under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) if \u201c[a]n amendment listed in subsection (c) does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(B). Where the statutory minimum sentence exceeds the top end of the applicable guideline range, the statutory minimum becomes the guideline. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Gl.l(b). The Sentencing Commission\u2019s application notes indicate that the operation of \u201ca statutory mandatory minimum term of imprisonment\u201d would prevent an amendment from \u201chav[ing] the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range.\u201d <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 cmt. n. 1(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-11\">McChriston\u2019s arguments are foreclosed by precedent and the record. McChriston\u2019s sentence was based upon an application of the statutory minimum sentence in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A)(iii), and, thus, he was ineligible for a sentence reduction because his applicable guideline range would not be reduced by the application of Amendment 706. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>549 F.3d 1337, 1341-42 (11th Cir.2008) (holding that a defendant sentenced to statutory minimum was not eligible for a sentence reduction, even where the court at the original sentencing had granted the government\u2019s motion under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 to sentence below the mandatory minimum). In addition, the district court did not have authority to apply <em>Apprendi </em>to redetermine the drug amount because a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding is not a full resen-tencing. <em>See United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217, 1220 (11th Cir.2005); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(3) (noting that proceedings \u201cdo not constitute a full resentencing of the defendant\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b286-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b286-9\">.
