On appeal, Aleman argues that the district court erred by denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion because his Guidelines range was subsequently lowered by Amendment 706.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">We review a district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for abuse of discretion and its conclusions regarding the scope of its legal authority <em>de novo. United States v. Williams, </em>549 F.3d 1337, 1338 (11th Cir.2008). A district court may modify a term of imprisonment in the case of a defendant who was sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a Guidelines range that has been lowered subsequently by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-9\">Aleman was sentenced as a career offender under \u00a7 4B1.1, so the district court lacked authority to reduce his sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) based on Amendment 706. <em>See United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1330 (11th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 965, 173 L.Ed.2d 156, <em>and </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 1601, 173 L.Ed.2d 689 (2009). Additionally, Aleman abandoned any claim under \u00a7 3582(e)(2) motion based on Amendment 599 by failing to raise the issue in his initial brief on appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See United States v. Thomas, </em>242 F.3d 1028, 1033 (11th Cir.2001) (noting that an appellant abandons an issue by failing to raise it in his initial brief). Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b289-12\">. Even if Aleman had not abandoned this claim, the district court did not err in denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion on the basis of Amendment 599. <em>See United States v. Armstrong, </em>347 F.3d 905, 908 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
