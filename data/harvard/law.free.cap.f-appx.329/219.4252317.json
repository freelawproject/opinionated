Riley\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion was based on Amendment 706 to the Guidelines, which reduced base offense levels applicable to crack cocaine. Riley\u2019s original total offense level was 40, with a criminal history category of I, resulting in a Guidelines range of 292 to 365 months\u2019 imprisonment. Riley was originally sentenced to 292 months\u2019 imprisonment. Riley\u2019s amended total offense level was 38, resulting in an amended Guidelines range of 238 to 293 months\u2019 imprisonment. The district court resentenced Riley to 238 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-24\">Riley asserts the district court erred in its application of \u00a7 3582(c)(2) when it refused to sentence him below the minimum of the amended Guidelines range. Riley asserts that, despite the language of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, which constrains the court\u2019s authority to vary from the amended range, that section, like all of the Guide<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>lines, is merely advisory under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">We recently addressed whether <em>Booker </em>and <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), prohibit Congress or the Sentencing Commission from limiting the discretion of a district court in reducing a sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190, 1190 (11th Cir.2009), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>(U.S. Feb. 10, 2009) (No. 08-8664). Concluding <em>Booker </em>and <em>Kimbrough </em>do not apply to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings, we held a district court is bound by the limitations on its discretion imposed by \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and the applicable policy statements by the Sentencing Commission. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">Based upon our holding in <em>Melvin, </em>Riley\u2019s argument the district court should have sentenced him below the amended Guidelines range is without merit. The applicable policy' statement, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2), and its commentary pre- \u2022 elude a district court from reducing a defendant\u2019s sentence below the amended Guidelines range if the defendant\u2019s original sentence fell within the then-applicable Guidelines range. Accordingly, we affirm Riley\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
