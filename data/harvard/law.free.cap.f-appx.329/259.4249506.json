As acknowledged by Avery, his argument is foreclosed by precedent. We recently held that neither <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), nor <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), apply to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings. <em>U.S. v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190, 1192 (11th Cir.2009) (holding that <em>\u201cBooker </em>and <em>Kim-brough </em>do not prohibit the limitations on a judge\u2019s discretion in reducing a sentence imposed by \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and the applicable policy statement by the Sentencing Commission\u201d). Therefore, the district court is bound by the limitations imposed by \u00a7 1B1.10 and lacks the authority to sentence a defendant below the amended guideline range. Accordingly, while Avery has preserved <em>his Melvin </em>challenge, we must affirm his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
