He contends that his sentence is not entitled to a presumption of reasonableness because it was calculated pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, which he argues is not supported by empirical evidence. Gutierrez-Garcia further contends that his sentence was greater than necessary to accomplish the goals of sentencing listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-24\">Gutierrez-Garcia\u2019s contention that his sentence is not entitled to a presumption of reasonableness because the relevant guideline is not supported by empirical evidence is without merit. <em>See United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 363-64 (5th Cir.2009). His sentence is presumptively reasonable. <em>See United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006). Moreover, the district court addressed the factors set out at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) when imposing his sentence. Gutierrez-Garcia has failed to rebut the presumption of reasonableness.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-25\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b597-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
