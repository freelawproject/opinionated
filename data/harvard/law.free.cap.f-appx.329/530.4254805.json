The district court denied the motion, determining that it lacked authority to reduce Roberson\u2019s sentence below the statutory minimum term of imprisonment. The Government has moved to dismiss the appeal as frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cm. R. 42.2. Roberson argues that he was entitled to a motion for a downward departure pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e) and that the Government declined to file such a motion because of improper motives.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>Section 3582(c) provides a mechanism by which a defendant may seek the \u201cretroactive application of a subsequently lowered guideline range.\u201d <em>See United States v. Shaw, </em>30 F.3d 26, 29 (5th Cir.1994). It does not authorize a sentence below the statutory minimum term of imprisonment. If a defendant provides assistance to the Government, the Government may, but is not required to, file a \u00a7 3553(e) motion permitting a district court to depart below the statutory minimum term of imprisonment. <em>Wade v. United States, </em>504 U.S. 181, 185, 112 S.Ct. 1840, 118 L.Ed.2d 524 (1992). Although a district court will review the Government\u2019s decision not to file such a motion if it was based on unconstitutional motives, Roberson\u2019s vague allegations of an improper motive are insufficient to make the substantial threshold showing required. <em>See id. </em>at 186, 112 S.Ct. 1840.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">Without a motion to depart pursuant to \u00a7 3553(e), the district court had no authority to sentence Roberson below the statutory minimum, as it correctly determined and, therefore, did not abuse its discretion in denying Roberson\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c) motion. <em>See Shaw, </em>30 F.3d at 28. For these reasons, the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss is GRANTED, Roberson\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel is DENIED, and this appeal is DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b560-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
