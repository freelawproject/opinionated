The petitioners, who are natives and citizens of Colombia, argue that the immigration judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) erred by finding that they were not eligible for either form of relief because they did not establish past persecution or a fear of future persecution based on a protected ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-12\">The government responds that the IJ\u2019s denial of relief rested on the persecution finding, and, alternatively, on the finding that the petitioners had failed to show that the Colombian government would not or could not protect them. The government argues that either of the two holdings was adequate to deny relief. It further argues that we lack jurisdiction to review the latter finding because the petitioners failed to raise that issue before the BIA. The government alternatively argues that, even if they had preserved the issue, they now have abandoned it by failing to raise it in their petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-13\">We \u201cmay review a final order of removal only if ... the alien has exhausted all administrative remedies available to the alien as of right.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1). If an alien fails to raise an issue before the BIA, we lack jurisdiction to consider that issue. <em>Fernandez-Bernal v. Att\u2019y Gen. of the United States, </em>257 F.3d 1304, 1317 n. 13 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-14\">We review only the BIA\u2019s decision, except to the extent that it adopts the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Chen v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1228, 1230 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam). We review the IJ\u2019s decision to the extent that the BIA adopts the IJ\u2019s reasoning. <em>Id. </em>Here, since the BIA adopted the IJ\u2019s decision without issuing its own opinion, we review the IJ\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-15\">To the extent that the IJ\u2019s decision is based on a legal determination, our review is de novo. <em>D-Muhumed v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>388 F.3d 814, 817 (11th Cir.2004). We review the factual determinations \u201cunder the substantial evidence test.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 817-18. \u201c[We] must affirm the [IJ\u2019s] decision if it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 818 (citation and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-16\">To be eligible for asylum, an applicant must prove refugee status. <em>Al Najjar v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number><em>Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001) (citing 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)). An applicant satisfies this burden by showing, with specific and credible evidence, either (1) past persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion; or (2) a well-founded fear of persecution on account of one of the above-listed factors. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a), (b). An applicant also must show that he cannot avail himself of his home country\u2019s protection. <em>Lopez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>504 F.3d 1341, 1345 (11th Cir.2007). An applicant who did not report persecution to his local authorities still may be eligible for asylum or withholding of removal if he convincingly shows that he could not have relied on the authorities because they would have been unwilling or unable to protect him. <em>Id. </em>An applicant who fails to establish eligibility for asylum generally cannot satisfy the higher burden for withholding of removal. <em>See Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1232 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam) (citation and quotation marks omitted). A petitioner seeking review of a BIA decision abandons an issue by \u201csimply stating that [it] exists, without further argument or discussion.\u201d <em>Singh v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>561 F.3d 1275, 1278-79 (11th Cir.2009) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"A82\">Here, the IJ denied the petitioners\u2019 asylum application after finding that they had not established past persecution or fear of future persecution based on a protected ground. The IJ alternatively denied their application because they failed to show that the Colombian government was unwilling or unable to protect them. Although the petitioners asserted before the BIA that they could not get the Colombian government\u2019s protection and that the government could not guarantee their safety, they failed to argue the merits of the issue. Consequently, we consider that issue abandoned, and we lack jurisdiction to review that aspect of the IJ\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"AWBy\">But even if the petitioners had preserved the issue, they have not provided any substantive argument that the IJ erred by finding that they had failed to establish that they could not avail themselves of the Colombian government\u2019s protection. Because that finding was fatal to their asylum and withholding of removal claims, the petitioners would not have been eligible for these forms of relief even if we found that they had established past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution. Finally, the petitioners have abandoned any claim that the IJ erred by denying them CAT relief because they did not brief that claim either before the BIA or this court.</p>\n<p id=\"AXW\">In light of the foregoing, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"Audy\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
