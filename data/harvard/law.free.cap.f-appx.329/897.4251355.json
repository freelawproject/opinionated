Kowallek appeals <em>pro se </em>the dismissal of his complaint after the district court entered a judgment on the pleadings for Donna Prest\u00eda. Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(c). Kowallek argues that the district court erred when it denied his motion to remand and dismissed his complaint with prejudice. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"898\">*898</page-number>We review <em>de novo </em>the denial of a motion to remand. <em>Henderson v. Washington Nat\u2019l Ins. Co., </em>454 F.3d 1278, 1281 (11th Cir.2006). We also review <em>de novo </em>a judgment on the pleadings. <em>Hardy v. Regions Mortgage, Inc., </em>449 F.3d 1357, 1359 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b928-4\">Prestia\u2019s untimely removal was defective, but that defect does not require us \u201c[t]o wipe out the adjudication post-judgment.\u201d <em>Caterpillar Inc. v. Lewis, </em>519 U.S. 61, 77, 117 S.Ct. 467, 477, 136 L.Ed.2d 437 (1996). Because Kowallek sued Pres-t\u00eda for refusing to divulge information she acquired as an employee of the Internal Revenue Service, the district court had removal jurisdiction. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1442(a)(1); <em>Allen v. Christenberry, </em>327 F.3d 1290, 1296 (11th Cir.2003). We will not address any defect in removal because the district court had subject-matter jurisdiction to dismiss Kowallek\u2019s complaint. <em>See Caterpillar Inc., </em>519 U.S. at 76-77, 117 S.Ct. at 477 (requiring that a judgment denying a motion to remand must be vacated when a <em>\u201cjurisdictional </em>defect remains uncured\u201d); <em>Ayres v. General Motors Corp., </em>234 F.3d 514, 519 (11th Cir.2000) (\u201cThe untimeliness of a removal is a procedural, instead of a jurisdictional, defect.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b928-5\">The district court did not err when it dismissed Kowallek\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim for relief. Prest\u00eda had no legal duty to help Kowallek research his suspicions of identity theft, and no law grants Kowallek redress for Prestia\u2019s failure to respond to his inquiries. It also would have been futile to allow Kowallek to amend his complaint. <em>See Hall v. United Ins. Co. of Am., </em>367 F.3d 1255, 1262 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b928-6\">The dismissal of Kowallek\u2019s complaint is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
