In April 2008, Pinckney moved the district court pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) based on Amendment 706 to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, which lowered the base offense levels applicable to crack cocaine offenses. He asserted that the court should sentence him below any amended Guidelines sentence range based on the sentencing factors of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), the policy statements of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). The district court summarily denied his motion, and he appeals.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b247-15\">Pinckney argues that he is entitled to \u00a7 3582 relief because his offense level was based on \u00a7 2D1.1, even though he was sentenced as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, that the district court committed procedural error in denying his motion based on its erroneous belief that he had been sentenced as a career offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-16\">A district court may modify a term of imprisonment where the defendant\u2019s sentence is based on a Guidelines sentence range that subsequently has been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Any reduction, however, must be \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A reduction of a term of imprisonment is not \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission\u201d \u2014 and is, therefore, not authorized under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) \u2014 if the retroactive amendment does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable sentence range. \u25a0 U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>A defendant whose original sentence ultimately was based on something other than the offense level calculation under \u00a7 2D1.1, such as the career offender provision of \u00a7 4B1.1, is precluded from receiving a sentence reduction because the amendment does not have the effect of lowering the applicable sentence range. <em>See United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1327 (11th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, McFadden v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 965, 173 L.Ed.2d 156 (2009), <em>and cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 1601, 173 L.Ed.2d 689 (2009); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.l(A)) (stating that a reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is not authorized where \u201cthe amendment ... is applicable to the defendant but the amendment does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range because of the operation of another guideline or statutory provision\u201d). If the offense level was based on \u00a7 2D1.1, however, the sentence range would be lowered, and Amendment 706 would apply. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-9\">Proceedings under \u00a7 3582 do not constitute a <em>de novo </em>resentencing. <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 781 (11th Cir.2000). Rather, \u201call original sentencing determinations remain unchanged.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A court applying an amendment under \u00a7 3582 \u201cmust recalculate the sentence under the amended guidelines, first determining a new base level by substituting the amended guideline range for the originally applied guideline range, and then using that new base level to determine what ultimate sentence it would have imposed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 780; <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-10\">Here, although Pinckney was sentenced as a career offender, his offense level was based on \u00a7 2D1.1 because that offense level was higher than the career offender offense level. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(b) (stating that the offense levels in \u00a7 4B1.1 apply as long as they are higher than the \u201coffense level otherwise applicable,\u201d such as the levels under \u00a7 2D1.1). Because the base offense levels under \u00a7 2D1.1 have been reduced, and Pinckney\u2019s sentence was based on \u00a7 2D1.1, Amendment 706 would have the effect of lowering Pinck-ney\u2019s sentence range. The district court accordingly erred in failing to recalculate the sentence range with the new base offense level and thereafter considering whether Pinckney was entitled to \u00a7 3582 relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-12\">Pinckney\u2019s argument that the district court committed error under <em>Booker, </em>however, is foreclosed by this court\u2019s precedent. <em>United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190, 1192-93 (11th Cir.2009) (holding that <em>Booker </em>does not \u201cprohibit the limitations on a judge\u2019s discretion in reducing a sentence imposed by \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and the applicable policy statement by the Sentencing Commission\u201d), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>(U.S. Feb. 10, 2009) (No. 08-8664).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-13\">The judgment of the district court is vacated and the case is remanded to enable the district court to make the proper Guidelines calculation and determine whether Pinckney is entitled to a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-14\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b247-13\">. In his brief, Pinckney argues that the court erred in denying his Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b) motion some two months after it denied his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. He did not appeal the Rule 60(b) ruling; therefore, it is not before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
