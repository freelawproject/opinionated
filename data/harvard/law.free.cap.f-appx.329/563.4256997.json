Sneed argues that the district court erred by determining that he was an armed career criminal under the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e). Sneed maintains that neither his prior Texas conviction for evading arrest or detention using a vehicle nor his prior Texas conviction for assault on a public servant qualify as violent felony convictions under the ACCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-10\">As Sneed acknowledges, his prior convictions for robbery and aggravated assault counted as two violent felony convictions under the ACCA. <em>See United States v. Davis, </em>487 F.3d 282, 287 (5th Cir.2007); <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>962 F.2d 1161, 1168-69 (5th Cir.1992). Sneed\u2019s prior conviction for evading arrest or detention using a vehicle is also a violent felony conviction under the ACCA. <em>See United States v. Harrimon, </em>568 F.3d 531, 532-37 (5th Cir.2009). Accordingly, Sneed has three prior violent felony convictions, and the district court did not err by determining that Sneed was an armed career criminal under the ACCA. <em>See </em>\u00a7 924(e)(1). We do not reach Sneed\u2019s argument that his prior conviction for assault on a public servant did not qualify as a violent felony conviction under the ACCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b594-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
