On resentencing following remand from this court, the district court sentenced Gould to 187 months in prison on Count One, within the advisory guidelines range, and to a mandatory consecutive sentence of five years on Count Three, for a total of 197 months. Gould now challenges that sentence. For the following reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\">Gould first contends that the district court committed procedural error by imposing a mandatory consecutive five-year term on the \u00a7 924(c) charge. Gould\u2019s contention is based on the so-called \u201cexception\u201d clause of \u00a7 924(c). In an unpublished opinion in 2006, we joined three other circuits to reject this same argument. <em>See United States v. Collins, </em>205 Fed.Appx. 196, 197-98 (5th Cir.2006). While this appeal was pending, we adopted the reasoning and holding of <em>Collins </em>in a published decision. <em>United States v. London, </em>568 F.3d 553, 563-64 (5th Cir.2009). Accordingly, we reject Gould\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">Gould next contends that his sentence was substantively unreasonable on several grounds. He first argues that the misapplication of the five-year minimum, which resulted in a total sentence of 197 years, rendered his sentence substantively unreasonable. Given our disposition of his challenge to the five-year mandatory minimum, this argument necessarily fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">Gould also challenges the substantive reasonableness of the sentence in light of his efforts while incarcerated to improve his education, the assistance he provided the Government in prosecuting others, and the disparity under the Sentencing Guidelines between sentences for crack cocaine offenses and powder cocaine offense. In light of the district court\u2019s careful consideration of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the evidence regarding the facts of this case, and the deferential standard of review, we discern no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s choice of a within-guidelines sentence. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 360 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b600-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b599-31\"><em> </em>Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
