The district court found that Amendment 706 reduced Lewis\u2019s guideline sentencing range from 324 to 405 months to 262 to 327 months, and imposed a sentence of 262 months\u2019 imprisonment. On appeal, Lewis argues that the district court erred by failing to consider his arguments under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005); and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) to determine whether a further reduction was appropriate. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-23\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-24\">\u201cIn a proceeding to modify a sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), we review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. White, </em>305 F.3d 1264, 1267 (11th Cir.2002). Under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court may modify a defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment where he \u201chas been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission....\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Any such reduction must also be consistent with the Commission\u2019s applicable policy statement in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b935-25\">When considering a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, a district court must engage in a two-part analysis. \u201cInitially, the court must recalculate the sentence under the amended guidelines, first determining a new base level by substituting the amended guideline range for the originally applied guide<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"906\">*906</page-number>line range, and then using that new base level to determine what ultimate sentence it would have imposed.\u201d <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 780 (11th Cir.2000). Next, the court must decide, in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and in its discretion, whether it will impose the newly calculated sentence or retain the original sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 781.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-20\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-8\">Lewis\u2019s <em>Apprendi </em>argument lacks merit, because the district court was not authorized to consider this argument in the context of a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(l) (\u201c[T]he court shah substitute only the [retroactive] amendments ... for the corresponding guideline provisions that were applied when the defendant was sentenced and shall leave all other guideline application decisions unaffected.\u201d); <em>see United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190, 1190 (11th Cir.) (\u201cholding] that a district court is bound by the limitations on its discretion imposed by \u00a7 3582(c)(2) <em>and the applicable policy statements by the Sentencing Commission\u201d) </em>(emphasis added), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 2382, 173 L.Ed.2d 1300 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b936-11\">With regard to Lewis\u2019s reasonableness argument, the district court specifically stated that it had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors and, in light of these factors, found the 262-month sentence to be reasonable. <em>See United States v. Eggersdorf, </em>126 F.3d 1318, 1322 (11th Cir.1997) (holding that the district court, in ruling on a \u00a7 3582 motion, need not \u201carticulate specifically the applicability \u2014 if any \u2014 of each of the section 3553(a) factors, as long as the record demonstrates that the pertinent factors were taken into account by the district court\u201d). Finally, to the extent that Lewis argues that <em>Booker </em>and <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), apply to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings, his arguments are foreclosed by precedent. <em>See Melvin, </em>556 F.3d at 1190; U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2)(A) (prohibiting reduction to a \u201cterm that is less than the minimum of the amended guideline range\u201d). Accordingly, upon review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm Lewis\u2019s 262-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
