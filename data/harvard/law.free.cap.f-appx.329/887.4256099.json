At sentencing, the district court relied on the hearsay statements of Parra-Gonzalez\u2019s codefen-dants in imposing the leader/organizer enhancement and in finding that he was responsible for 22 kilograms of cocaine. Parra-Gonzalez objected that the hearsay was unreliable, but did not object to the manner in which the district court made its factual findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-16\">On appeal, Parra-Gonzalez argues that the district court\u2019s factual findings that he was eligible for enhancements were based solely on unreliable hearsay. He contends that the district court erred by failing to make specific findings as to the credibility of the hearsay statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-17\">We review the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error. <em>United States v. Yeager, </em>331 F.3d 1216, 1226 (11th Cir.2003). If a defendant does not raise his allegation of sentencing error before the district court, we review the issue only for plain error. <em>United States v. Dudley, </em>463 F.3d 1221, 1227 (11th Cir.2006). \u201cUnder <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>plain error review, there must be (1) an error, (2) that is plain, and (3) affects substantial rights. When these three factors are met, we may exercise discretion and correct the error if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b919-5\">Hearsay may be admitted at sentencing if there are \u201csufficient indicia of reliability, the [district] court makes explicit findings of fact as to credibility, and the defendant has an opportunity to rebut the evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Zlatogur, </em>271 F.3d 1025, 1031 (11th Cir.2001) (quotations omitted). \u201c[T]he focus is upon the question of [the hearsay\u2019s] reliability, which must be determined on a case by case basis.\u201d <em>United States v. Lee, </em>68 F.3d 1267, 1275 (11th Cir.1995). \u201cWhile it may be advisable and in some instances necessary for a district court to make distinct findings regarding the reliability of hearsay statements used at sentencing, the absence of such findings does not necessarily require reversal or remand where the reliability of the statements is apparent from the record.\u201d <em>United States v. Gordon, </em>231 F.3d 750, 761 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b919-6\">Because we conclude from the record that the hearsay statements by Parra-Gonzalez\u2019s codefendants were supported by sufficient indicia of reliability and Par-ra-Gonzalez had an opportunity to rebut those statements, we hold that the district court did not clearly err by relying on the codefendants\u2019 hearsay statements. Moreover, because the district court implicitly found that the statements by Parra-Gon-zalez\u2019s codefendants were reliable and that finding is apparent from the record, we conclude that the district court did not plainly err by failing to make an explicit factual finding of credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-7\">Parra-Gonzalez next argues that the facts did not support the leader/organizer enhancement, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(a), because (1) it was based on unreliable hearsay; (2) he did nothing to organize the cocaine shipment; and (3) he did not participate in any of the calls coordinating the shipment. He also contends that he was not responsible for the entire 22-kilogram cocaine shipment, but only for the 14 kilograms that he owned.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-9\">\u201cA district court\u2019s enhancement of a defendant\u2019s offense level based on his role as an organizer or leader is a finding of fact reviewed for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. Rendon, </em>354 F.3d 1320, 1331 (11th Cir.2003). Under clear error review, when two permissible views of the evidence exist, the factfinder\u2019s choice between them will not be clearly erroneous. <em>United States v. De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 945 (11th Cir.1999) <em>(en banc) </em>(citing <em>Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, N.C., </em>470 U.S. 564, 575, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 1512, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985)). \u201cThe government bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant had an aggravating role in the offense.\u201d <em>Yeager, </em>331 F.3d at 1226. The government also \u201cmust establish the quantity of drugs by the preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Ismond, </em>993 F.2d 1498, 1499 (11th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b919-10\">The Sentencing Guidelines provide for an enhanced offense level for a defendant who had an aggravating role in the offense. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1. A four-level enhancement may be applied if \u201cthe defendant was an organizer or leader of a criminal activity that involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(a). In determining whether a \u00a7 3Bl.l(a) enhancement applies, the district court should consider \u201c(1) exercise of decision-making authority, (2) nature of participation in the commission of the offense, (3) recruitment of accomplices, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>(4) claimed right to a larger share of the fruits of the crime, (5) degree of participation in planning or organizing the offense, (6) nature and scope of the illegal activity, and (7) degree of control and authority exercised over others.\u201d <em>Rendon, </em>354 F.3d at 1331-32 (quotation omitted) (citing U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1 cmt. (n.4)). \u201cThere can, of course, be more than one person who qualifies as a leader or organizer of a criminal association or conspiracy.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1 cmt. (n.4). The defendant does not have to be the \u201csole leader or kingpin of the conspiracy in order to be considered an organizer or leader within the meaning of the Guidelines.\u201d <em>Rendon, </em>354 F.3d at 1332 (quotation omitted). The district court\u2019s application of a \u00a7 3Bl.l(a) enhancement is given deference on appeal. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b920-4\">When a conviction stems from a conspiracy charge, the defendant is responsible for the amount of drugs in all reasonably foreseeable acts done in furtherance of the conspiracy. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.3(a). \u201cFor sentencing purposes a member of a drug conspiracy is hable for his own acts and the acts of others in furtherance of the activity that the defendant agreed to undertake and that are reasonably foreseeable in connection with that activity.\u201d <em>Ismond, </em>993 F.2d at 1499.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-5\">We conclude from the record that the district court did not clearly err by giving Parra-Gonzalez a leader/organizer enhancement because (1) he admitted to organizing importation of the cocaine; (2) he demanded evidence from his codefendants that the entire 22-kilogram cocaine shipment had been seized; (3) his codefen-dants, who were involved in transporting the cocaine, were so afraid of him that they went to the U.S. Embassy to obtain proof of the seizure, knowing that they would be prosecuted; (4) he was involved in planning the shipment; (5) he owned 14 out of the 22 kilograms of cocaine; (6) he was referred to as \u201cJefe,\u201d meaning boss; and (7) he was present when his phone was used to call the Miami cell leader on the day the cocaine was seized. Lastly, we conclude from the record that the district court did not clearly err in finding that Parra-Gonzalez was accountable for the entire 22-kilogram cocaine shipment because he was part of the conspiracy and knew about the cocaine shipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-7\">For the above-stated reasons, we affirm Parra-Gonzalez\u2019s 188-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
