The district court sentenced Jones concurrently to 120 months of imprisonment on the firearm count and 125 months of imprisonment on the bank robbery counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-18\">In 2008, Jones filed a pleading entitled, \u201cRequest for Nunc Pro Tunc Review of Sentence.\u201d Jones alleged that he was not credited for 220 days he spent in custody prior to being sentenced. Jones asked the district court to consider his good behavior and continuing education during his nine years in prison. The district court denied Jones\u2019s motion without assigning reasons or ordering a response from the Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-23\">Jones now appeals the denial of his pro se motion, arguing that he is entitled to credit for 220 days that he spent in custody before he was sentenced; the district court did not consider U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3 in determining whether his federal and state sentences should run concurrently or consecutively; and his postconviction rehabilitation should be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-24\">Jones\u2019s argument that he did not receive presentence credit for 220 days that he spent in custody is not cognizable in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 proceedings; such an argument must be addressed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. <em>See United States v. Brown, </em>753 F.2d 455, 456 (5th Cir.1985). As Jones is not incarcerated in the Southern District of Texas, the district court did not have jurisdiction to consider such an argument from Jones. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b603-25\">Jones\u2019s argument that the district court failed to correctly apply the Sentencing Guidelines is not cognizable under \u00a7 2255. <em>See United States v. Segler, </em>37 F.3d 1131, 1134 (5th Cir.1994). His request for a reduced sentenced based on his good behavior in jail is also not cognizable under \u00a7 2255. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2255(a); <em>Segler, </em>37 F.3d at 1137 (noting Congress\u2019s intent to \u201climit the types of claims cognizable under \u00a7 2255 to claims relating to unlawful custody\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-26\">The judgment of the district court is MODIFIED to reflect a dismissal in part due to the district court\u2019s lack of jurisdic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>tion to entertain Jones\u2019s request for pre-sentence credit for 220 days that he spent in custody, and this judgment is AFFIRMED as so modified.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b603-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
