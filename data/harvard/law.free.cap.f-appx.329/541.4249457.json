California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Martinez has not filed a response. Our independent review of the record and counsel\u2019s brief discloses no nonfrivolous issue for appeal. Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-24\">The record does reveal a clerical error in the judgment. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 36. Although the district court\u2019s docket sheet indicates that the district court dismissed Count 2 of the indictment against Martinez, that dismissal is not reflected in the written judgment. This matter is REMANDED for correction of the clerical error pursuant to Fed.R.CRIm.P. 36.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b571-26\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
