Mackey\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion was based on Amendment 706 to the guidelines, which reduced base offense levels applicable to crack cocaine. Mackey contends that the court erred by \u201cdenying consideration of the [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 8553(a)\u201d factors when evaluating his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. He also argues that, despite being the minimum of his amended guideline range, his sentence is \u201cgreater than necessary\u201d and is thus unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-24\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>(11th Cir.2008). A district court may modify a term of imprisonment where a defendant was sentenced based on a sentencing range that subsequently has been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Any reduction the court imposes, however, must be \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The applicable policy statements provide that \u201cthe court shall not reduce the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(c)(2) and this policy statement to a term that is less than the minimum of the amended guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(2)(A); <em>United States v. Williams, </em>557 F.3d 1254, 1256 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">When considering a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, a district court first \u201cmust substitute the amended guideline range for the originally applied guideline range and determine what sentence it would have imposed.\u201d <em>United States v. Vautier, </em>144 F.3d 756, 760 (11th Cir.1998). Mackey does not argue that the court erred at this step. After determining what sentence it would have imposed under the amended guideline range, the court then \u201cmust consider the factors listed in \u00a7 3553(a) and determine whether or not to reduce the defendant\u2019s original sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>While a district court must consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, it \u201ccommits no reversible error by failing to articulate specifically the applieability-if any-of each of the section 3553(a) factors, as long as the record demonstrates that the pertinent factors were taken into account by the district court.\u201d <em>United States v. Eggersdorf, </em>126 F.3d 1318, 1322 (11th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">It is unclear from the record whether the district court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in granting the sentence reduction. Nonetheless, the court sentenced Mackey to the minimum term permitted by his amended guideline range. We have held that district courts do not have the authority to dip below the amended guideline range on resentencing. <em>See United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190, 1193-94 (11th Cir.2009) (holding that, because <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), does not apply to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motions, district courts must comply with the \u201capplicable policy statements of the Sentencing Commission\u201d not to resentence below the minimum of the amended guideline range). The district court was bound by the limitations imposed by U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 and thus did not err in refusing to sentence Mackey below the minimum of his amended guideline range. His sentence was not unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
