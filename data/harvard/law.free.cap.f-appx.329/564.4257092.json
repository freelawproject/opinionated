He argues that the district court plainly erred in enhancing his sentence pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i) based upon his prior state conviction for violating California Health and Safety Code \u00a7 11379.6(a). Specifically, Romo argues that \u00a7 11379.6(a) does not constitute a \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)\u00a9 because California case law and pattern jury instructions establish that the statute punishes not only the manufacturing of methamphetamine but also acts done in the preparation of making methamphetamine and does not require the possession of a controlled substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">As Romo concedes, because he did not object to the \u00a7 2L1.2 enhancement in the district court, our review of this question is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 339 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 328, 172 L.Ed.2d 236 (2008). Under the plain error standard, Romo must establish (1) error, (2) that is clear or obvious, and (3) that affects substantial rights. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 272 (5th Cir.2005). If these conditions are met, we \u201cmay exercise [our] discretion to correct the error only if the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-10\">We need not decide whether California Health and Safety Code \u00a7 11379.6(a) constitutes a \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A). When considering whether an offense constitutes a \u201cdrug trafficking offense,\u201d a district court \u201cmay consider the statutory definition of the predicate offense, the charging paper, and the jury instructions.\u201d <em>Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d at 273. The \u201cfelony complaint\u201d for Romo\u2019s state conviction, which was included in the record on appeal,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> charged that, inter alia, the crime of \u201cmanufacturing methamphetamine\u201d in violation of \u00a7 11379.6(a) was committed by Romo \u201cwho did unlawfully manufacture, compound, convert, produce, derive, process <em>and </em>prepare [m]ethamphetamine.\u201d Romo pleaded guilty to that charge, and the abstract of the judgment demonstrates that he was convicted of that charge. Pursuant to California law, Romo\u2019s plea of guilty to the conjunctively-listed offenses included a plea of guilty to the offense of manufacturing methamphetamine. <em>See People v. Mendias, </em>17 Cal.App.4th 195, 21 Cal.Rptr.2d 159, 163-64 (1993). Accordingly, there was no clear or obvious error by the district court in considering his guilty-plea conviction as conduct constituting a drug trafficking offense under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-14\">In light of the record, as supplemented on appeal, Romo has failed to show that any error in enhancing his offense level under \u00a7 2L2.1 is clear or obvious. <em>See United States v. Fernandez-Cusco, </em>447 F.3d 382, 388 (5th Cir.2006). The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b595-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b595-16\">. The clerk of this court granted Romo\u2019s unopposed motion to supplement the record on appeal with documents relating to his pri- or state conviction.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
