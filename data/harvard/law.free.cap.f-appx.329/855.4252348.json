The district court denied Prettyman\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, concluding that he was ineligible for a sentence reduction because he was sentenced to a statutory minimum term of 240 months\u2019 imprisonment under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). On appeal, Prettyman argues that the district court erred in finding that he was ineligi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>ble for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction because the district court, during his original sentencing, did not conduct a hearing on the government\u2019s information filed pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851. He contends that the district court\u2019s failure to hold the hearing in compliance with \u00a7 851 led to the erroneous use of a prior state conviction to enhance his sentence. Prettyman argues that these errors prevented him from being eligible for a sentence reduction under Amendment 706.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-4\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008) (per curiam). A district court may modify a term of imprisonment in the case of a defendant who was sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that subsequently has been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Any reduction, however, must be \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The applicable policy statements, found in Guidelines \u00a7 1B1.10, provide that a sentence reduction is not authorized under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) if \u201c[a]n amendment listed in subsection (c) does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range.\u201d U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B). The commentary elaborates that a reduction is not authorized if an applicable amendment does not lower a defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range \u201cbecause of the operation of another guideline or statutory provision (e.g., a statutory mandatory minimum term of imprisonment).\u201d U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 1B1.10, cmt. n. 1(A). Guidelines \u00a7 5G1.1 provides that \u201c[w]here a statutorily required minimum sentence is greater than the maximum of the applicable guideline range, the statutorily required minimum sentence shall be the guideline sentence.\u201d U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 5Gl.l(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b886-6\">Here, the district court did not err in determining that Prettyman, who was sentenced to a statutory minimum term of 240 months\u2019 imprisonment under \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A), was not eligible for a sentence reduction because his sentence was not affected by Amendment 706. <em>See </em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 1B1.10, cmt. n. 1(A); <em>United States v. Williams, </em>549 F.3d 1337, 1342 (11th Cir.2008) (per curiam) (holding that a defendant was not eligible for a sentence reduction under Amendment 706 because he \u201cwas subject to a statutory mandatory minimum sentence that replaced his original guideline range ... \u201d). Furthermore, we decline to review Prettyman\u2019s argument that the district court failed to comply with the procedural requirements of \u00a7 851 during his original sentencing proceedings because that argument is outside the scope of the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding. <em>See United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 781-82 (11th Cir.2000) (declining to address an Eighth Amendment argument raised in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding because \u00a7 3582(c)(2) \u201cdoes not grant to the court jurisdiction to consider extraneous resen-tencing issues ...\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b886-8\">Upon our review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we discern no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
