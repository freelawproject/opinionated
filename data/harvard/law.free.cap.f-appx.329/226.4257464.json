Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). We review the BIA\u2019s legal determinations <em>de novo. D-Muhumed v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>388 F.3d 814, 817 (11th Cir.2004). We review the BIA\u2019s factual determinations under the \u201csubstantial evidence test,\u201d and must affirm the BIA\u2019s decision \u201cif it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 818 (quotation marks omitted). To reverse, we must find that the record not only supports reversal, but compels it. <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-10\">To qualify for asylum, an applicant must show either past persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion. INA \u00a7 101(a)(42)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A); <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1230-31 (11th Cir.2005). Although the INA does not define persecution, this Court has noted that \u201cpersecution is an extreme concept, requiring more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation,\u201d and that \u201cmere harassment does not amount to persecution.\u201d <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231 (quotation marks and brackets omitted). Thus, mere threats, without more, do not amount to persecution. <em>See, e.g., Djonda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>514 F.3d 1168, 1174 (11th Cir.2008); <em>Silva v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>448 F.3d 1229, 1237 (11th Cir.2006); <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-16\">Here, substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s determination that Zhao was not eligible for asylum because he had not shown past persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution. Zhao testified that he was not in fact a Falun Gong practitioner, but had merely driven some Falun Gong members to a gathering. Zhao heard that his name was on a list of Falun Gong members that the Chinese security bureau was looking to arrest and that the security bureau twice visited his house and threatened to arrest him. Under our precedent, these events are not severe enough to constitute past persecution. <em>See Djonda, </em>514 F.3d at 1174; <em>Silva, </em>448 F.3d at 1237; <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-17\">Furthermore, the record does not compel a conclusion that he has a well-founded fear of future persecution. The statement in the State Department\u2019s China Country Report on Human Rights Practices for 2006 that some Falun Gong ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>herents had been abused while in police custody does not compel a conclusion that Zhao would be singled out for such treatment if he were returned to China. Also, Zhao heard that some of the Falun Gong members he had driven to the gathering were arrested, but he did not testify that any of them were mistreated while in custody. <em>See Zheng v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>451 F.3d 1287, 1290-91 (11th Cir.2006) (concluding that brief detention of Falun Gong practitioner by police did not rise to level of persecution). Because Zhao did not satisfy the eligibility requirement for asylum, he necessarily cannot meet the more stringent standards for withholding of removal and CAT relief. <em>See Zheng, </em>451 F.3d at 1292.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">Finally, we find no merit to Zhao\u2019s due process claim. Zhao failed to show that the allegedly inadequate translation at his removal hearing caused him substantial prejudice. <em>See Patel v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>334 F.3d 1259, 1263 (11th Cir.2003) (explaining that to show substantial prejudice, an alien must show the outcome would have been different had the alleged due process violation not occurred). Zhao does not argue that the Mandarin-speaking interpreter created an incomplete or inaccurate factual record or that the outcome would have been different with a Wen-zhou-speaking interpreter. Zhao argues only that translation difficulties led the IJ to discredit his testimony. However, the BIA did not adopt the IJ\u2019s credibility finding and instead presumed Zhao\u2019s testimony was credible. Thus, Zhao has not shown any prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b257-11\">. On appeal, Zhao has not challenged the BIA\u2019s determination with regard to his claim of forced sterilization of his wife who remains in China. Thus, this claim is deemed abandoned. <em>See Sepulveda v. U.S. Att'y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
