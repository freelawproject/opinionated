Johnson is a federal prisoner previously convicted of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute over 50 grams of cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846. The district court denied Johnson\u2019s motion because Johnson was sentenced as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, and therefore Amendment 706 did not change his Guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">On appeal, Johnson concedes that he was. sentenced as a career offender and that, per <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323 (11th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, McFadden v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 965, 173 L.Ed.2d 156, <em>and cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1601, 173 L.Ed.2d 689 (2009), he was not eligible for \u00a7 3582 relief because his final sentencing range was based on U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, not \u00a7 2D1.1. However, Johnson argues that the district court erred as a matter of law in order to seek further review on the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-12\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008). A district court may reduce a term of imprisonment in the case of a defendant who was sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Any reduction, however, must be \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The applicable policy statements, found in \u00a7 1B1.10, state that a reduction of a term of imprisonment is not authorized if the retroactive amendment does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable Guideline range. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-14\">The district court did not err in refusing to reduce Johnson\u2019s sentence because Johnson was sentenced as a career offender pursuant to \u00a7 4B1.1. <em>Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1327 (holding that a defendant sentenced as a career offender pursuant to \u00a7 4B1.1 is not entitled to \u00a7 3582 relief because Amendments 706 and 713 did not lower the applicable guideline range for career offenders).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
