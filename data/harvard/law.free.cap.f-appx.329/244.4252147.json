Cochran contends that the district court erred in denying his motion for judgment of acquittal because there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction. He argues that the jury was \u201cconfronted with equally persuasive theories of guilt and innocence\u201d and that a rational trier of fact could not have found guilt beyond a reasonable doubt because \u201cthe government\u2019s case rested on the testimony of a singular officer,\u201d \u201canother person was present at the scene where the gun was recovered,\u201d and Cochran\u2019s fingerprints were not on the gun or the bullets found by the arresting officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-14\">Section \u00a7 922(g)(1) makes it unlawful for a felon knowingly to possess a firearm that affected or was in interstate commerce. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1); <em>United States v. Wright, </em>392 F.3d 1269, 1273 (11th Cir.2004). \u201cPossession can be shown by circumstantial as well as direct evidence\u201d and \u201ccan be either actual or constructive.\u201d <em>Wright, </em>392 F.3d at 1273. We review <em>de novo </em>the sufficiency of the evidence to support a conviction, \u201cviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, with all reasonable inferences and credibility choices made in the government\u2019s favor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We will not overturn a conviction on the grounds of insufficient evidence unless no rational trier of fact could find that the evidence establishes the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Id. </em>The jury is free to choose among reasonable constructions of the evidence, and we must accept a jury\u2019s inferences and determinations of witness credibility. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>390 F.3d 1319, 1323 (11th Cir.2004); see <em>also Wright, </em>392 F.3d at 1273.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-15\">We conclude that there was ample evidence from which a rational trier of fact could have found Cochran guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. The arresting officer testified that, as he emerged from his cruiser, he saw Cochran drop a shiny, silver, palm-sized object to the ground. He further testified that he recovered a loaded .25 automatic handgun from the location where Cochran had been standing and that the gun was not rusted or corroded in a way that would indicate it had been there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>for a while. Although there was another man at the scene, the officer testified that the man had been standing in the middle of the road apart from Cochran, who had been standing in a grassy area between the road and the sidewalk.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">The government also presented a latent print examiner who testified that there was \u201cnot enough detail\u201d on the recovered weapon or ammunition \u201cfor any sort of identification or comparison\u201d but also that people do not automatically leave fingerprints when they touch something. He noted that certain factors can prevent fingerprints from transferring to an object, such as whether that object had been \u201cdropped on the ground\u201d or had come \u201cin contact with dirt or debris.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">Finally, the government offered a special agent with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, who testified that the gun involved in this case had traveled in interstate commerce because it had been manufactured in Illinois, sold in Georgia, and eventually recovered in Florida. In addition to the government\u2019s evidence, cross examination of Cochran revealed that he was a seven-time felon who was admittedly under the influence of marijuana the day he was arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">The jury was entitled to reject Cochran\u2019s testimony that it was the other man present at the scene \u2014 and not Cochran\u2014 who possessed the weapon in favor of the opposing testimony presented by the government. <em>See Williams, </em>390 F.3d at 1323. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, the district court did not err in denying Cochran\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal. <em>See Wright, </em>392 F.3d at 1273.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
