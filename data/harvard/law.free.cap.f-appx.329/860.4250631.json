After a sentencing hearing, Wynn was sentenced to 170 months\u2019 im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>prisonment, which was in the middle of his Guidelines range of 151 to 188 months. A panel of this Court affirmed his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">On March 3, 2008, Wynn filed a motion to reduce his sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), arguing he was eligible for relief under Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines. In his motion, Wynn requested a new sentencing hearing and for the district court to consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, his post-conviction rehabilitation, and his wife\u2019s health problems. Without holding a new sentencing hearing, the district court granted the motion and reduced Wynn\u2019s sentence to 136 months\u2019 imprisonment, which is in the middle of his amended Guidelines range of 121 to 151 months. Wynn\u2019s subsequent motion for reconsideration, requesting a further reduction of his sentence, was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-6\">Wynn, appearing pro <em>se, </em>appeals the denial of his motion for reconsideration and argues the district court erred by (1) denying his request for a sentence below the amended Guidelines range, and (2) denying his request for a lower sentence within the amended Guidelines range. We address these issues in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-8\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s determination of the scope of its authority under the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1326 (11th Cir.2008). This Court recently addressed whether <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), prohibits Congress or the Sentencing Commission from limiting the discretion of a district court in reducing a sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190 (11th Cir.2009). Concluding <em>Booker </em>does not apply to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings, we held a district court is bound by the limitations on its discretion imposed by \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and the applicable policy statements by the Sentencing Commission. <em>Id. </em>at 1193-94.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-10\">Section 1B1.10 of the Sentencing Guidelines and its commentary preclude a district court from reducing a defendant\u2019s sentence below the amended Guidelines range if the defendant\u2019s original sentence fell within the then-applicable Guidelines range. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2)(A)-(B) &amp; cmt. n. 3. Wynn\u2019s original sentence was 170 months\u2019 imprisonment, which was within his Guidelines range, so the district court was not permitted under \u00a7 1B1.10 to sentence Wynn to a term below the amended Guidelines range. Based upon our holding in <em>Melvin, </em>Wynn\u2019s argument that the district court erred by denying his request for a sentence below the amended Guidelines range is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-12\">We next address Wynn\u2019s contention that the district erred by not reducing his sentence to a lower term within the amended Guidelines range. A district court\u2019s resolution of a motion under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), based on a subsequent change in the Sentencing Guidelines, is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Brown, </em>332 F.3d 1341, 1343 (11th Cir.2003). We have instructed the district court to engage in a two-part analysis when determining whether to reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 780 (11th Cir.2000). First, the district court must recalculate the sentence under the amended Guidelines. <em>Id. </em>It is apparent from the resentencing order, issued on the AO-247 form entitled \u201cOrder Regarding Motion for Sentence Reduction,\u201d the district court calculated Wynn\u2019s amended Guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>Second, the district court must decide, in its discretion, if it will impose a new sentence or retain the original sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 781. While a district court must consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in making this determination, it \u201ccommits no reversible error by failing to articulate specifically the applicability \u2014 if any \u2014 of each of the ... factors, as long as the record demonstrates that the pertinent factors were taken into account by the district court.\u201d <em>United States v. Eggersdorf, </em>126 F.3d 1318, 1322 (11th Cir.1997). In <em>United States v. Williams, </em>557 F.3d 1254 (11th Cir.2009), we vacated a sentence reduction and remanded to the district court after determining there was nothing in the record to show the court had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>Id. </em>at 1257.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-4\">All we have before us is the AO-247 form showing the amended Guidelines range and granting Wynn\u2019s request for a sentence reduction. In addition, just as in <em>Williams, </em>there is no sentencing transcript for us to review on appeal. We are not suggesting the district judge was required to hold a new sentencing hearing, but it is not apparent from the record that he considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors when deciding to reduce Wynn\u2019s sentence to the middle of the amended Guidelines range. Without such information, we lack a meaningful basis from which we can determine whether the district court abused its discretion in deciding how much to reduce Wynn\u2019s sentence. Accordingly, we vacate the district court\u2019s order and remand for further consideration and explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-5\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
