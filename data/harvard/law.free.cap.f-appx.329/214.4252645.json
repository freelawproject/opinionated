The district court denied the motion because Dileo\u2019s base offense level was determined using the career-offender guideline, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, rather than the drug-quantity guideline, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1. Dileo argues that this was error because he actually was not sentenced as a career offender, given that the district court granted a downward departure from the career-offender guideline imprisonment range because of his diminished mental capacity. Dileo also argues that the Sentencing Guidelines are merely advisory, and that the district court should have departed beyond two levels in light of the continued sentencing disparity between cocaine powder and crack cocaine. Based on our precedent in <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1326 (11th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, McFadden v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 965, 173 L.Ed.2d 156 (2009), <em>and cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 1601, 173 L.Ed.2d 689 (2009), we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b245-20\">We review <em>de novo </em>\u201cthe district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under the [Guidelines].\u201d <em>Id. </em>Pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2), when an already-incarcerated defendant\u2019s sentence was determined using a guideline range that ret<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>roactive amendments to the Guidelines have reduced, the district court may reduce the sentence, after considering the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and if such a reduction would be consistent with the policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Pursuant to \u00a7 1B1.10, a reduction is not consistent with its policy statements if the retroactive amendment in question does not have the effect of lowering defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">In <em>Moore, </em>we held that, when a defendant was sentenced as a career offender, and \u00a7 2D1.1 played no role in the calculation of his career offender guideline range, his sentenced was not \u201cbased on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered\u201d and the district court lacked authority to grant a reduction under Amendment 706. 541 F.3d at 1327-28, 1330. We held that this was so even when a defendant was granted a downward departure based on diminished capacity. <em>Id. </em>at 1330. We reasoned that, because the district court did not calculate the defendant\u2019s guideline range using \u00a7 2D1.1, her sentence was not affected by Amendment 706. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">The district court did not err in denying Dileo\u2019s motion. <em>See id. </em>at 1326. Nothing in the record suggests that the holding in <em>Moore, </em>that defendants who are sentenced as career offenders are not entitled to reductions, even if they are granted a downward departure, does not apply. <em>See id. </em>at 1327-28, 1330. The district court set Dileo\u2019s base offense level pursuant to \u00a7 4B1.1. The district court\u2019s downward departure was taken from this base offense level. Because he was not sentenced based upon the \u00a7 2D1.1 base offense level, Amendment 706 did not affect Dileo\u2019s sentence. <em>See id. </em>To the extent that Dileo argues that <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), gave the district court an independent basis to grant a sentencing reduction, his argument is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190, 1192-93 (11th Cir.2009) (holding that <em>Booker </em>\u201cdo[es] not prohibit the limitations on a judge\u2019s discretion in reducing a sentence imposed by \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and the applicable policy statement by the Sentencing Commission\u201d), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>(U.S. Feb. 10, 2009) (No. 08-8664). Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b245-12\">. Upon Dileo\u2019s appeal from the district court\u2019s denial of his motion, we ordered Dileo\u2019s appeal stayed pending resolution of <em>Moore. </em>After deciding <em>Moore, </em>we directed the parties to advise whether any issues remained unresolved. Based on the parties\u2019 responses, we ordered that the matter be briefed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
