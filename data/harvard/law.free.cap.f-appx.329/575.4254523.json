The district court sentenced him to serve 120 months in prison and a 10 year term of supervised release. Lopez challenges his term of supervised release in this appeal. He argues that his term of supervised release is unreasonable because it is greater than necessary to meet the goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3558(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-22\">We review this issue for plain error only due to Lopez\u2019s failure to present it to the district court. <em>See United States v. Allison, </em>447 F.3d 402, 405 (5th Cir.2006). To show plain error, Lopez must show a forfeited error that is clear or obvious and that affects his substantial rights. <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 1429, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). If he makes such a showing, this court has the discretion to correct the error but will do so only if the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b605-25\">Our review of the record shows that Lopez has not met this standard. The 10 year supervised release term imposed by the district court was within both the statutory and applicable guideline ranges. Further, the district court\u2019s comments at sentencing show that it considered the factors given in \u00a7 3553(a) when choosing this term. Lopez has not shown plain error with respect to the district court\u2019s imposition of a 10 year term of supervised release. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>Puckett, </em>129 S.Ct. at 1429.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b605-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
