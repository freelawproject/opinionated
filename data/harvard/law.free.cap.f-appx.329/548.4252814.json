Easton, and Joseph Craig obtained a summary judgment of dismissal of the employment discrimination action filed against them by Plaintiff-Appellee Heather Weathers, which dismissal was affirmed on appeal. Appellants returned to district court seeking attorneys\u2019 fees as prevailing parties under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927. In a Memorandum and Order filed October 8, 2008, the district court rejected the Appellants\u2019 motion for attorneys\u2019 fees but granted their request for costs. For essentially the same reasons set forth by the district court, the judgment appealed from is, in all respects,</p>\n<p id=\"b578-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b578-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
