Collins\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion was based on Amendment 706 to the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines, which reduced the base offense level applicable to crack cocaine offenses involving fewer than 4.5 kilograms of cocaine. On appeal, Collins asserts that the district court held him accountable for at least 1.5 kilograms of crack cocaine, but did not make a specific finding that more than 4.5 kilograms were involved. Thus, Collins argues that the court erred by denying him a sentence reduction pursuant to Amendment 706.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-14\">In a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding, we review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under the Guidelines. <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1326 (11th Cir.2008), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1601, 173 L.Ed.2d 689 (2009). We review the district court\u2019s decision to deny a sentence reduction for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Jones, </em>548 F.3d 1366, 1368 n. 1 (11th Cir.2008) (per cu-riam), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. , 129 S.Ct. 1657, 173 L.Ed.2d 1025 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b923-18\">A court may not modify a term of imprisonment once it has been imposed except \u201cin the ease of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 994(o).\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). The applicable policy statement provides that if a defendant\u2019s guideline range \u201chas subsequently been lowered as a result of an amendment to the Guidelines Manual listed in [\u00a7 1B1.10(c) ], the court may reduce the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment as provided by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2),\u201d and \u201cany such reduction in the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment shall be consistent with this policy statement.\u201d U.S. Sentenoing Guidelines MaNual \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(l) (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b923-19\">\u201cUnder Amendment 706, the guidelines now provide a base offense level of 36 for defendants who are responsible for at least 1.5 kilograms but less than 4.5 kilograms of crack cocaine. However, a base offense level of 38 still applies to defendants responsible for 4.5 kilograms or more.\u201d <em>Jones, </em>548 F.3d at 1369 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b923-20\">At sentencing, the district court acknowledged that the trial evidence established that Collins was accountable for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"894\">*894</page-number>quantity of drugs corresponding to base offense level 88. Because Collins\u2019s base offense level was calculated in the presen-tence investigation report based on a total of more than 4.5 kilograms of cocaine base, his base offense level remains unchanged by Amendment 706. Accordingly, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Collins a sentence reduction pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b924-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
