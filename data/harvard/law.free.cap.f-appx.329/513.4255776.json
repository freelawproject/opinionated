Rhine argues that the district court erred in attributing five kilograms of crack cocaine to him as relevant conduct. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l). The district court made the factual finding that the quantities in the count of conviction and in the challenged relevant conduct were related. Given the evidence in the record linking the two quantities, we cannot say that the district court\u2019s finding was clearly erroneous. <em>See United States v. Alford, </em>142 F.3d 825, 831-32 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-26\">Rhine further argues that the relevant conduct finding by the district court was neither admitted by him nor proven beyond a reasonable doubt and, for this reason, infringed upon his Sixth Amendment rights. Following <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), \u201c[t]he sentencing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>judge is entitled to find by a preponderance of the evidence all the facts relevant to the determination of a guideline sentencing range.\u201d <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>445 F.3d 798, 798 (5th Cir.2006). Rhine\u2019s argument that his statutory maximum sentence was unreasonable because his guidelines range was not properly calculated in violation of the Sixth Amendment is without merit. <em>See United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 553 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b543-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
