For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-18\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-19\">A federal grand jury returned an indictment charging Dunlap and 5 codefendants with conspiracy to possess with intent to manufacture and distribute more than 5 kilograms of cocaine and more than 50 grams of crack cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(l)(A)(ii) and (fix), and 846. Dunlap pled guilty pursuant to a written plea and cooperation agreement. Per this agreement, Dunlap would cooperate with the government through debriefings and trial testimony, and the government had the \u201csole discretion\u201d to submit a U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 or Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(b) motion based on this assistance. Before sentencing, the government submitted a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion. The government specified, \u201cThe government files this motion on [Dunlap\u2019s] behalf based upon [his] agreement to continue his cooperation and testify against current [codefendants] in the instant case and other individuals who he has identified and may be prosecuted as this investigation continues,\u201d and warned, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>\u201cSuch testimony will not qualify as a basis for a future reduction of sentence under [Rule] 35,\u201d and \u201cNo additional motion for substantial assistance shall be filed by the government based upon the cooperation referred to above.\u201d At sentencing, the district court noted that Dunlap\u2019s guideline imprisonment range was 360 months\u2019 to life, but took into account the \u00a7 5K1.1 motion and sentenced Dunlap to 150 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-4\">Dunlap filed the instant pro <em>se </em>motion to compel the government to perform its promises under the plea and cooperation agreement. Dunlap asserted that, post-sentencing, he had provided information and testimony that helped to secure the conviction of Charles Wright, a co-eonspir-ator who had been separately indicted, but that the government refused to submit a Rule 35(b) motion based on this assistance. The government responded that it had not promised that it would submit a Rule 35(b) motion if Dunlap testified against Wright, and that Dunlap\u2019s assistance regarding Wright was covered by the \u00a7 5K1.1 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-5\">At an evidentiary hearing, Andrew Gil-lis, an agent with the Drug Enforcement Agency assigned to Dunlap\u2019s case, testified that the \u201cother individuals\u201d to which the \u00a7 5K1.1 motion referred included Wright. When Dunlap and his codefendants were indicted, the government knew of Wright\u2019s activities and that he was involved in the same conspiracy as Dunlap, but chose not to include him on the same indictment for management purposes. Instead, the government indicted Wright at some point after Dunlap was sentenced. Agent Gillis testified that, during post-sentencing interviews, Dunlap provided information, and agreed to testify, against Wright. Dunlap raised the issue of the government filing a Rule 35(b) motion \u201cmany times.\u201d However, neither Agent Gillis nor the government counsel ever told Dunlap that the government would do so in connection with his assistance regarding Wright. Rather, on these occasions, Gillis told Dunlap that their conversations still concerned the same conspiracy and that, should Dunlap provide information on a \u201cnew case,\u201d Gillis would notify government counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-8\">The district court denied the motion to compel. The district court reasoned that Dunlap had neither alleged nor made a substantial showing that the government refused to submit a Rule 35(b) motion because of an unconstitutional motive. The district court reasoned that, rather, the government declined to submit a Rule 35(b) motion based on his assistance regarding Wright because it already had submitted a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion that covered this assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-10\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s decision that it lacks authority to reduce a sentence under Rule 35(b). <em>United States v. Orozco, </em>160 F.3d 1309, 1312-13 (11th Cir.1998). Pursuant to Rule 35(b), \u201c[u]pon the government\u2019s motion made within one year of sentencing, the court may reduce a sentence if the defendant, after sentencing, provided substantial assistance in investigating or prosecuting another person.\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(b)(1). The Supreme Court has held that this statute gives the government \u201ca power, not a duty, to file a motion when a defendant has substantially assisted.\u201d <em>Wade v. United States, </em>504 U.S. 181, 185, 112 S.Ct. 1840, 1843, 118 L.Ed.2d 524 (1992) (considering motions filed pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e) and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1). Indeed, the Supreme Court held that the government\u2019s discretion is such that federal district courts may review the government\u2019s refusal to file a substantial-assistance motion only if the defendant first makes a \u201csubstantial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>threshold showing\u201d that the refusal was based upon an unconstitutional motive, such as the defendant\u2019s race or religion. <em>Id. </em>at 185-86, 112 S.Ct. at 1843-44. We have held that arguments that the government had reasons other than the defendant\u2019s provision of substantial assistance do not satisfy the Supreme Court\u2019s unconstitutional-motive standard. <em>See United States v. Nealy, </em>232 F.3d 825, 831 (11th Cir.2000). In <em>Nealy, </em>the government conceded that the defendant had provided substantial assistance by testifying against his supplier. <em>Id. </em>Five days after the defendant had provided this testimony, however, he was arrested for again possessing crack cocaine with intent to distribute. <em>Id. </em>For that reason, the government declined to file the substantial assistance motion. <em>Id. </em>The defendant argued that the government could not refuse to file the motion for \u201creasons other than the nature of [defendant\u2019s] substantial assistance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We held that this contention was not supported by the Supreme Court\u2019s aforementioned ruling and \u201c[was] contrary to the broad grant of prosecutorial discretion recognized by this [C]ourt.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b902-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-5\">The district court lacked the authority to compel the government to file a Rule 35(b) motion. <em>See Orozco, </em>160 F.3d at 1312-13. Dunlap h\u00e1s not made a substantial showing that the government refused to do so based on an unconstitutional motive, such as his race or religion. <em>See Wade, </em>504 U.S. at 185-86, 112 S.Ct. at 1843-44. Dunlap\u2019s conclusory statements to this effect are insufficient, especially as the government\u2019s pleadings and Agent Gil-lis\u2019s testimony demonstrate that the government did not file a Rule 35(b) motion based on his assistance regarding Wright because it believed this sentence was covered by the \u00a7 5K1.1 motion. <em>See id. </em>Likewise, Dunlap\u2019s claim that the government\u2019s reason was not related to the type or quality of his assistance and lacked a rational relationship to a government interest does not establish that he merits relief. <em>See Nealy, </em>232 F.3d at 831. Moreover, to the extent that Dunlap argues that the government breached the terms of its plea agreement, his argument is without merit, as the district court specifically retained \u201csole discretion\u201d to submit a substantial assistance motion and actually did so. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
