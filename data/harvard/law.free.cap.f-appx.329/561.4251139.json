Amaya-Orellana (Amaya), a citizen and native of El Salvador, seeks review of the decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) dismissing his appeal and denying his motion to remand the case to the immigration judge (IJ). Amaya has conceded that he is removable for having illegally entered the United States. He sought asylum, withholding of removal, cancellation of removal, and \u201cspecial rule cancellation\u201d under the Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act (NACARA). The IJ deemed Amaya\u2019s various claims for relief from removal to have been abandoned because Amaya\u2019s counsel failed to comply with the IJ\u2019s explicit orders to provide certain documentation and sworn declarations supporting Amaya\u2019s claims. The IJ offered Amaya the opportunity to file a timely motion for reconsideration, but Amaya did not do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-8\">On appeal to the BIA, where he was represented by new counsel, Amaya did not directly challenge the IJ\u2019s decision concerning the abandonment of his claims. Rather, he argued that prior counsel was ineffective for failing to comply with the IJ\u2019s order. The BIA concluded that Ama-ya had not satisfied the requirements of <em>In </em>re <em>Lozada, </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 637, 689 (BIA 1988), necessary to establish a claim of ineffective counsel. The BIA further noted that Amaya had failed to show that he had been prejudiced by counsel\u2019s performance because he had failed to show any entitlement to relief from removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-13\">In this court, Amaya, through counsel, concedes that he is not eligible for cancellation of removal under NACARA, but he contends that the IJ improperly required him to present sworn evidence with regard to his claims for asylum and withholding of removal. He argues that the IJ should have allowed him to proceed with those claims, despite counsel\u2019s failure to provide the documentation and evidence required for the NACARA claim. Amaya did not raise this issue before the BIA. Therefore it is unexhausted, and this court lacks jurisdiction to consider it. <em>See Wang v. Ashcroft, </em>260 F.3d 448, 452-53 (5th Cir.2001); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1). In addition, Amaya has abandoned his claim of ineffective counsel by failing to brief it. <em>See Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 833 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-14\">Amaya\u2019s petition for review is DISMISSED IN PART and DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b592-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
