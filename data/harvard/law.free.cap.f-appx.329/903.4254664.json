He contends that his sentence is substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-22\">We review the reasonableness of the district court\u2019s sentencing determination only for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Gall v. United, States, </em>552 U.S. 38, -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1191 (11th Cir.2008). \u201c[T]he party who challenges the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in the light of both [the] record and the factors in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). The district court need not state that it has explicitly considered each factor and need not discuss each factor. <em>Id. </em>at 786. Instead, \u201can acknowledgment by the district court that it has considered the defendant\u2019s arguments and the factors in section 3553(a) is sufficient.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cIn this Circuit, we presume that a sentence within the guidelines range is reasonable, but the presumption may be rebutted by the circumstances of a particular case viewed in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Sarras, </em>571 F.3d 1111, 1141 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b933-25\">Shields was sentenced to 168 months imprisonment, the low-end of his guidelines range of 168-210 months. He argues that the district court\u2019s sentence was substantively unreasonable because it overrepresented his criminal history and failed to take into account the disparity in the sentencing guidelines between crack and powder cocaine offenses. Those arguments fail. The district court stated that it had considered all of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and it did not treat the guidelines as mandatory. The district court concluded that a sentence at the low-end of the guidelines range was \u201creasonable and necessary in [Shields\u2019] case.\u201d It noted that the sentence \u201cmeets the goals of punishment and, hopefully, would deter anyone <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"904\">*904</page-number>else who might consider similar criminal conduct\u201d but that, given the mitigating circumstances that Shields raised at the sentencing hearing, <em>\u201ca </em>greater sentence is not required.\u201d Additionally, Shields\u2019 argument that the district court found that \u201cit was unable to consider the disparity between guideline sentences for crack versus powder cocaine\u201d is simply untrue. There is nothing in the record to support that argument. Under <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, -, 128 S.Ct. 558, 564, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), the district court <em>may </em>consider the sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine, but it is not required to. Here it did not. That decision is within the district court\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-6\">Shields was significantly involved in a major drug distribution scheme. The record reflects that the district court considered the \u00a7 3553 factors in light of the facts of Shields\u2019 case. Shields has not rebutted our presumption that the district court\u2019s within-guidelines sentence is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
