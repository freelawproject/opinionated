For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-23\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-24\">In 1998, a federal grand jury returned a superseding indictment, charging Potts with: possession with intent to distribute crack cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2 (Count 1); possession of unregistered firearms, in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5861(d) and 5871, and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2 (Count 2); use of a firearm in relation to a drug-trafficking crime, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 924(c) and 2 (Count 3); and being a felon in possession of firearms, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(2) and 924(a)(2). After a jury trial, the court entered a judgment of conviction against Potts on Counts 1, 2, and 4, imposing a life sentence as to Count <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>1 and concurrent sentences of 120 months\u2019 imprisonment as to Counts 2 and 4. After a direct appeal and a remand from the Supreme Court in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we affirmed Potts\u2019s convictions and sentences in 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-4\">In 2007, Potts\u2019s filed the instant Fed. R.Civ.P. 60(b)(3) motion, arguing that \u201cthe Honorable Magistrate Judge and the Government Attorneys perpetrated fraud upon the federal court by misinforming Petitioner at arraignment about the possible maximum penalty he faced on the Count One Drug Charge.\u201d Specifically, Potts argued that, despite being informed that he faced a maximum sentence of life imprisonment, he was subject only to a statutory maximum sentence of 30 years\u2019 imprisonment under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C) because no drug quantity was charged in the indictment. As a result, he requested that the district court \u201creverse the conviction and sentences in the instant case.... \u201d The motion was filed in the same court and under the same case number as the original criminal case.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-5\">The district court summarily denied Potts\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion without explanation. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-7\">\u201cThis court typically reviews a district court\u2019s ruling upon a Rule 60(b) motion for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Burke v. Smith, </em>252 F.3d 1260, 1263 (11th Cir.2001). However, we \u201creview questions concerning a district court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction <em>de novo.\u201d United States v. Al-Arian, </em>514 F.3d 1184, 1189 (11th Cir.2008) (emphasis added), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>(U.S. No. 08-137) (July 30, 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b884-8\">Rule 60(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides, <em>inter alia, </em>that the district court \u201cmay relieve a party or its legal representative from a final judgment, order, or proceeding\u201d if there is \u201cfraud (whether previously called intrinsic or extrinsic), misrepresentation, or misconduct by an opposing party.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(3). However, it is well-established that the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure do <em>not </em>provide for relief from judgment in a criminal case. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 1 (\u201cThese rules govern the procedure in all <em>civil </em>actions and proceedings ....\u201d) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b884-10\">In <em>United States v. Mosavi, </em>138 F.3d 1365, 1366 (11th Cir.1998), a defendant brought a Rule 60(b) motion challenging criminal forfeiture orders entered in his criminal case. Concluding that the \u201cdistrict court lacked the subject matter jurisdiction necessary to provide relief under Rule 60(b),\u201d we affirmed the district court\u2019s denial of the Rule 60(b) motion. <em>Id. </em>at 1365-66. We explained \u201cthat the defendant cannot challenge the criminal forfeiture orders at issue under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure\u201d because \u201c[t]he judgment and order that the defendant contests were entered, not in a civil case, but in a criminal case....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1366. In other words, \u201cRule 60(b) simply does not provide for relief from judgment in a criminal case, and as such the defendant cannot challenge the criminal forfeitures at issue under Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b).\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b884-11\">\n<em>III.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b884-12\">In this case, there is no dispute that Potts\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion sought relief from the judgment in his criminal case. In the motion, he argued that, due to the indictment\u2019s failure to allege drug quantity, he was misinformed regarding the applicable statutory penalties. In his prayer for relief, he specifically requested the district court to \u201creverse his conviction and sentences in the instant case.\u201d Further, the motion was filed in the same court and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>under the same case number as the original criminal case. Nor did the motion refer to or request the district court to reconsider any previous ruling in a civil action. In sum, because Potts\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion sought relief from the judgment entered in his criminal case, the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to grant Potts relief. <em>Mosavi, </em>138 F.3d at 1365-66. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
