Gil argues that the district court erred in denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion and that under <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323 (11th Cir.2008), cert. <em>denied, McFadden v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 965, 173 L.Ed.2d 156 (2009), <em>and cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 1601, 173 L.Ed.2d 689 (2009), the court had the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>discretion to apply a reduction because he was not sentenced within the career-offender guideline range. Alternatively, he argues that <em>Moore </em>was wrongly decided and that under <em>United States v. </em>Booker; 543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the district court could have reduced his sentence because the Guidelines are merely advisory. He also contends that the court should have considered the reasonableness of his sentence and the crack-to-powder-cocaine sentencing disparity, pursuant to <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">In a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding, \u201cwe review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. White, </em>305 F.3d 1264, 1267 (11th Cir.2002). \u201cWe review de novo questions of statutory interpretation.\u201d <em>United States v. Maupin, </em>520 F.3d 1304, 1306 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">A district court may modify a term of imprisonment in the case of a defendant who was sentenced based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). In <em>Moore, </em>we held that, if the defendant was sentenced as a career offender under \u00a7 4B1.1, and the range was not affected by \u00a7 2D1.1, then the sentence is not \u201cbased on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered.\u201d <em>Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1327-28. There, we noted that the base offense levels under \u00a7 2D1.1 played no role in the calculation of the sentencing guideline range for the defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 1327. Thus, even though Amendment 706 was retroactive, the district court was not authorized to reduce the sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 1330.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">Like Gil, the defendants in <em>Moore </em>argued that they were eligible for reductions because they received downward departures, and, thus, were not sentenced within the career offender guideline ranges. <em>Id. </em>at 1329. In rejecting this argument, we contrasted two district court cases where the defendants received subsequent sentencing reductions despite their status as career offenders. <em>Id. </em>In the first district court case, the sentencing court granted a career offender a downward departure, pursuant to U.S.S.G, \u00a7 4A1.3, based on the district court\u2019s finding that the criminal history category over-represented the seriousness of the defendant\u2019s criminal history and \u201csentenced the defendant within the otherwise applicable guideline range.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In the second district court case, the sentencing court similarly granted a career offender a downward departure under \u00a7 4A1.3 and \u201cassigned the offense level that would have applied absent the career offender designation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In both cases, the district courts exercised their discretion in granting a subsequent sentencing reduction based on their determination that the defendant\u2019s original sentences were not based on the career offender guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-9\">Here, Gil\u2019s initial base offense level from \u00a7 2D1.1 was a 30, with a three level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, leaving him with a total offense level of 27. However, because he was a career offender, he was assigned a base offense level of 34, pursuant to \u00a7 4Bl.l(b), and after a three level reduction for acceptance of responsibility was left with an offense level of 31. He was also assigned a criminal history category of VI, given his career offender status. Based on his offense level of 31 and criminal history category of VI, his guideline range was 188 to 255 months\u2019 imprisonment. After considering the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the district court sentenced Gil below the guideline range to 108 months\u2019 imprisonment. In doing so, the district court commented, in part, that the guideline range as determined by \u00a7 4B 1.1(b) was \u201ca lot of time for a small transaction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Alyg\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>Gil argues that the district court\u2019s downward variance to 108 months\u2019 imprisonment shows that it believed the criminal history was overstated by the career offender enhancement because this imprisonment term was equivalent to a base offense level of 31 and criminal history category of I. He notes that the district court commented during his sentencing hearing that 188 to 255 months was \u201ca lot of time for a small transaction.\u201d As such Gil argues that pursuant to the rationale of the district court cases discussed in <em>Moore, </em>the district court could have exercised its discretion to grant Gil\u2019s motion <em>for </em>a sentence reduction because his original sentence demonstrated the district court\u2019s disagreement with the criminal history category of VI provided for by the career offender enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"A2I\">While we agree with Gil that the district court expressed its concern with the amount of time of the sentencing range provided for by the career offender enhancement, we find that the district court did not then base Gil\u2019s actual sentence on the \u201cotherwise applicable guideline range\u201d as the district courts did in the cases cited in <em>Moore. </em>Even if we accept Gil\u2019s argument that the district court\u2019s sentence of 108 months\u2019 imprisonment is based on a combination of an offense level of 31 and criminal' history category of I, the offense level of 31 derives from the career offender offense levels and not from \u00a7 2D1.1. In addition, while imposing the 108 months\u2019 sentence, the district court stated that it was adopting the findings and conclusion in the Pre-Sentence Investigation Report and also that it was \u201caccepting the guideline range.\u201d Thus, there is no indication that the court based Gil\u2019s sentence on the guideline range, e.g. \u00a7 2D1.1, that would have applied absent the career-offender designation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See Moore, </em>541 F.Bd at 1327-28, 1380; U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.l(A)) (prohibiting reduction where \u201camendment does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range because of the operation of another guideline\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"AKx\">Moreover, the district court did not have authority to reduce Gil\u2019s sentence under <em>Booker </em>based on its reasonableness or the crack-to-powder-cocaine ratio. <em>See United States v. Jones, </em>548 F.3d 1366, 1369 (11th Cir.2008) (holding that <em>Booker </em>itself does not render a defendant eligible for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2)). Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"AEE\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"A_x\">. We have also reviewed the sentencing transcripts and note that nowhere does the district court indicate that it is sentencing Gil based on the \u201cotherwise applicable guideline range\u201d or that it had assigned an offense level that would apply absent the career offender enhancement. Rather we find that the district court's imposition of a sentence below the career offender guideline range was based on its review of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
