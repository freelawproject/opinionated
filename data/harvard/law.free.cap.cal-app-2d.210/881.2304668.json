Plaintiff prayed for injunctive relief to prevent payment of any money on account of said construction contract, contending that the contract is void. Nowhere in the complaint does plaintiff allege that he ever approached the defendant\u2019s board of trustees in an effort to obtain a correction of what he appears to contend are erroneous wage rates. Nowhere does plaintiff allege that he made any attempt to follow the administrative procedure provided by Labor Code section 1773.4. Nowhere does he allege that the collective bargaining agreements referred to by him were ever called to the atttention of the defendant or that a copy of said agreement was ever filed with the Director of Industrial Relations. After issuance of an original restraining order a hearing on an order to show cause was apparently had, the restraining order was dissolved and the preliminary injunction was denied. Plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-4\">Administrative Remedy</p>\n<p id=\"b900-5\">The facts and the law material to the right of the plaintiff to a preliminary injunction are, for all practical purposes, identical with those involved in <em>Hoffman </em>v. <em>Pedley School District, </em>No. 6872, <em>ante, </em>p. 72 [26 Cal.Rptr. 109], filed this day. For the reasons set forth in that opinion, the order is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-6\">Griffin, P. J., and Coughlin, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-7\">Appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied January 16, 1963.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
