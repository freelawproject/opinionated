There is no allegation that said agreements were ever called to the attention of defendant\u2019s board of trustees. There is no allegation that plaintiff or anyone ever approached defendant\u2019s board of trustees to ask a revision of the wage rate or ever suggested to the board that such wage rate was in error in any particular. There is no allegation that plaintiff, or anyone, filed a petition with the Director of Industrial Relations to correct said wage rate as is provided by Labor Code section 1773.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">For the reasons set forth in <em>Hoffman </em>v. <em>Pedley School District, </em>No. 6872, <em>ante, </em>p. 72 [26 Cal.Rptr. 109] filed this day, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-8\">Griffin, P.
