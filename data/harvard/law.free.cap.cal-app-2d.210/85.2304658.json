At the trial the officer testified respecting his conversation with Mrs. Flores that, among other things, \u201cI asked her if I might have permission to look through her house. She stated \u2018Yes\u2019 and started looking for the house key. Her mother came in, shortly thereafter, and there was some conversation about her having given the mother the house key. So they both looked, and then Mrs. Flores informed me that they couldn\u2019t find it, but that there was a broken window on the side of their house that was easy to get into.\u201d Thereafter, the officer asked the brother to accompany him to 1809 Logan Street; upon arrival went to the broken window; requested the brother to enter the home through this window; entered the house after the brother had complied with this request and opened the front door; and, upon search, located articles implicating the defendant in the burglary of the service station and the attempted burglary of the market. These articles were offered in evidence as exhibits in support of the People\u2019s case. The defendant objected thereto upon the ground that they had been obtained without a search warrant and in violation of his constitutional guarantee against unlawful searches and seizures. The court overruled the objection upon the ground that permission to make the subject search had been given. The defendant contends that this ruling was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">A search of premises made in good faith pursuant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>to consent voluntarily given by one having apparent authority to do so, is not unreasonable. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Caritativo, </em>46 Cal.2d 68, 73 [292 P.2d 513]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Michael, </em>45 Cal.2d 751, 753 [290 P.2d 852] ; <em>People </em>v. <em>Gorg, </em>45 Cal.2d 776, 783 [291 P.2d 469]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Ransome, </em>180 Cal.App.2d 140, 145 [4 Cal.Rptr. 347] ; <em>People </em>v. <em>Howard, </em>166 Ca.l.App.2d 638, 651 [334 P.2d 105].)  The existence of such consent is a question of fact to be determined by the trial court. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>47 Cal.2d 374, 377 [303 P.2d 721] ; <em>People </em>v. <em>Michael, supra, </em>45 Cal.2d 751, 752; <em>People </em>v. <em>McCoy, </em>195 Cal.App.2d 655, 657 [16 Cal.Rptr. 117].) If there is any substantial evidence to support such determination, it will be affirmed on appeal. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Daugherty, </em>40 Cal.2d 876, 885 [256 P.2d 911].)</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">In the instant case the evidence adequately supports the implied finding of the trial court that Mrs. Plores consented to the search of her home. The defendant\u2019s contention to the contrary is based on the testimony of Mrs. Plores and her brother that consent had not been given. However, this testimony merely raised a conflict in the evidence, the resolution of which was an exclusive function of the trial court. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Gorg, supra, </em>45 Cal.2d 776, 781; <em>People </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>184 Cal.App.2d 69, 76 [7 Cal.Rptr. 202] ; <em>People </em>v. <em>Melody, </em>164 Cal.App.2d 728, 734 [331 P.2d 72].) In this regard it is worthy of note that in response to a question by the trial judge, Mrs. Plores testified that she was looking for the key during the course of the officer\u2019s interview with her because she \u201cwas going to let him go look in the house.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">The defendant claims that, in any event, the search was unlawful because the evidence establishes without conflict that entry into the house through a window by Mrs. Flores \u2019 brother, and his subsequent opening the front door to permit the officer\u2019s admittance, was without her consent. However, it is obvious that the officer was the person who made the entry resulting in the search to which the defendant objects. The fact that the officer\u2019s entry was facilitated by the act of an agent using a contemplated way of entry did not avoid the consent to enter.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-9\">\u201cIn this proceeding we are not concerned with enforcing defendant\u2019s rights under the law of trespass and landlord and tenant, but with discouraging unreasonable activity on the part of law enforcement officers.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Gorg, supra, </em>45 Cal.2d 776, 783.)</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>Under the circumstances in the case at bar the method of admission into the subject premises and the subsequent search to which the defendant objects, were not unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">The order of the court admitting the evidence in question was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">Griffin, P. J., and Shepard, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
