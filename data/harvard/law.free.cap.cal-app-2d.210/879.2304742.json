This is the same case as that spoken of in <em>Hoffman </em>v. <em>Pedley School District, </em>No. 6872, <em>ante, </em>p. 72 [26 Cal.Rptr. 109], filed this day. The facts are the same except that the amended complaint, herein considered, added in its first paragraph a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"880\">*880</page-number>full description of plaintiff\u2019s representative capacity on behalf of the Building Construction Trades Council and various affiliate and member unions and dropped the defendant trustees as parties defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-4\">No effort was made to allege that the administrative processes provided by Labor Code section 1773.4 had been complied with and plaintiff concedes that no effort was, in fact, made to take that procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-5\">For the reasons set forth in <em>Hoffman </em>v. <em>Pedley School District, </em>No. 6872, <em>ante, </em>p. 72 [26 Cal.Rptr. 109], filed this day, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-6\">Griffin, P. J., and Coughlin, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-7\">Appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied January 16, 1963.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
