Practice. Decided by Judge Pope. Eulton Superior Court. October Term, 1868.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b647-7\">Starling H. Bryant made affidavit that, \u201c as a mill-wright, he claims a lien on a certain saw-mill\u201d on Terrell creek, on land lot 248, seventeenth district in said county, \u201c for personal services and labor performed as such mill-wright, in the building of said saw-mill for William McConnellthat \u201che claims to be due him as such mill-wright, as aforesaid, for such personal service and labor as aforesaid, from said Wm. McConnell, the owner of said saw-mill,\u201d $150 50, etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b647-8\">The Justice of the Inferior Court, before whom this affidavit was made, ordered the Clerk of said Court to issue a <em>ft. fa. </em>\u201cagainst said McConnell and said saw-mill\u201d for said sum and costs. In what shape the <em>ft. fa. </em>issued does not appear by the record. To arrest this <em>ft. fa., </em>McConnell made his affidavit that he did not owe the money claimed by said Bryant, and that the <em>ft. fa. </em>was proceeding illegally, because it was not in accordance with the statutes for such cases provided.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b647-9\">The parties were at issue and the cause on the appeal-.. When it was called, counsel of record for McConnell stated, that McConnell was not present, had made no arrangements to pay their fee, and that they would no longer represent him. Plaintiff\u2019s attorney introduced no testimony and took no ver*diet, but moved to take an order that defendant\u2019s affidavit be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>dismissed, that the <em>fi. fa. </em>proceed as if no defence had been filed, and that plaintiff have leave to enter judgment for costs. The order was granted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b648-5\">Attorneys, employed since the Court, representing McConnell, appear and say the Court erred in passing said order, in not requiring plaintiff to make out his cause before the jury, in not dismissing the proceeding, because it contained no items or particulars of his said services, and because it did .not state that plaintiff is a mill-wright, because <em>the fi. fa., </em>was against the land when the order of the Justice was that <em>fi. fa., </em>should issue against the saw-mill, and because land can not be sold under a <em>fi.fa. </em>to enforce a mill-wright\u2019s lien.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b648-6\">Arnold <em>&amp; </em>Boyles, for plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AO2I\">cited in support of the 1st and 2d points, Irwin\u2019s Code, sections 1970, 1973, 3405; 37 <em>Ga.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"b648-9\">The defendant in this case filed the affidavit authorized by the statute, which, with the plaintiff\u2019s affidavit, in the language of the statute, formed <em>\u201c </em>an issue to be returned to the Court, and tried as other causes.\u201d See Revised Code, secs. 1970, 1972.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-10\">When the defendant, McConnell, failed to appear and defend, as the issue was pending in the Court on the appeal, the plaintiff had a right to proceed <em>ex parte, </em>to make out his case. But he was bound to make out a <em>prima facie </em>case, by evidence to the jury, before he was entitled to a judgment. And after the issue was made up in Court, he had no right to proceed further with his affidavit or execution, till he obtained a judgment, and sued out an execution upon that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>We think the Court erred in ruling that the defendant\u2019s affidavit be dismissed, and that the execution proceed, and we, therefore, order that the judgment be reversed, and that the cause be remanded for another hearing.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
