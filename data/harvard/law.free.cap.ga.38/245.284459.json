A. Robinson, sworn on the part of plaintiffs, testified he knew Herbert W. Blair, formerly Blair &amp; Gennett. Blair had a stock of goods worth some, eight to ten thousand dollars, in same store with witness, each occupying half the store. Blair made an assignment .early in 1867; first heard of it from outside parties; then asked Blair, and Blair told him he had made an assignment. Swasey, one of the parties for whose benefit the assignment was made, had been in Columbus some two months before the assignment was made; made his headquarters at Blair\u2019s store; understood from Blair that Swasey was to send him goods to sell, to keep him employed. Blair expected goods to be sent soon after the assignment was made. A small lot was sent not long after, worth about $70 00; they were kept separate from the goods assigned. Clapp took possession soon after'the assignment was made; can\u2019t say whether it was as much as a week. Clapp arranged for the rent of thestore, and hired a Mr. Etheridge to take charge of the goods.

Code, secs. 1942, 1943, 1954, 1955. <em>3d Kelly, Ga. R., </em>158. 9th Bacon, Abr., 245. 11th Wendell R., 187. 2 John. Ch. R., 576.

Second, because the verdict was contrary to law and the evidence. The Court overruled the motion for a new trial, which is now assigned for error here.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">Was the charge of the Court right? How stood the old' law upon the question of assignments by insolvent debtors, prior to the Act of 1865-6, now incorporated in the new Code? By the 1954th section of the old Code, an assignment by an insolvent debtor of his property, in <em>trust </em>for the benefit of any one or more of his creditors, to the exclusion of any other creditor, in equal participation of such property, was declared to be <em>void. </em>By the 1942d section of the new Code, <em>only </em>such assignments of property by an insolvent debtor are declared void, <em>where any trust or benefit is reserved to the </em>assignor, <em>or any person for him.' </em>Why was an assignment made by an insolvent debtor of his property to one creditor, to the exclusion of others, void ? Because the <em>old law </em>declared <em>it should be so. </em>Why is <em>not </em>such an assignment void <em>now ? </em>Because, the law, as it now stands, <em>does -not declare </em>that it shall be so. Construing the 1943d section of the new Code, and the 1942d section, together, as being, <em>in pari materia, </em>the <em>intention </em>of the Legislature, we think, is quite plain, that an insolvent debtor may make an assignment of his property in trust, for the benefit of one or more of his creditors, to the exclusion of others, so that it is don e <em>bona fide, </em>and no <em>trust </em>or <em>benefit </em>be reserved to the assignor, or any person for him. There was no error in the charge of the Court upon this point in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">The jury having found the assignment to have been <em>bona </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number><em>fide </em>under the evidence submitted on the trial, and. the Court below being satisfied with the verdict, we will not disturb it by ordering a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">Let the judgment of the Court below be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
