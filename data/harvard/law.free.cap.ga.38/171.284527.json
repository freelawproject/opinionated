Decided by Judge Milner. \"Whitfield Superior Court. October Term, 1867.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b179-9\">On the 22d of July, 1866, Robert IT. Caldwell owed said Dickson $747 46, and gave him a mortgage on four slaves to secure it. On the 4th of June, 1857, Caldwell owed Dickson other debts, amounting to $450, and to secure them, gave him another mortgage on said slaves. These mortgages were uly recorded. Judgments of foreclosure was had on said mortgages on the 20th of October, 1859, and on the 5th of December, 1859, respectively. In 1859, (at what date does not appear,) said Caldwell became the agent of the Western and Atlantic Railroad, and so continued during 1860. In each year, he gave bond and security for his good conduct a3 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>such agent, and for 1860, said Dickson was one of his securities.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Ac6\">Caldwell, as such agent, was a defaulter, and the Comptroller General issued two <em>fi. fas. </em>against Caldwell and his securities on said bonds for said years for $1,316 07, and for $173 71, with interest, costs, etc., respectively. In January, 1861, these four j?. <em>fas. </em>were levied on said slaves, the slaves were sold under them, and brought $1,805 00. This fund being in the sheriff\u2019s hands, a motion was made to require him to pay the Dickson <em>fi. fa. </em>therewith. The Comptroller General resisted the motion upon a claim of priority of lien. . .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b180-6\">The Judge held that Dickson should be paid in preference to the State, but that, in as much as he was one of the securities against whom the State\u2019s small <em>fi. fa. </em>had been issued, its amount should be paid to the State out of said fund, and it should be given to Dickson, that he might control it against Caldwell, and that any surplus, after paying Dickson, should be paid to the State.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b180-7\">The Comptroller General assigns for error the decision that Dickson\u2019s <em>fi. fa. </em>had priority of lien before said State fi. <em>fas.</em></summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b180-8\">Sprayberry, J.

Revised Code, sec. 981. Acts of 1858, p. 62, secs. 1-6-7-8.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-9\">As the road is the property of the State, and its income as much part of her revenue as the taxes collected by her, it seems that these Acts are simply declaratory of what the law was prior to their passage.</p>\n<p id=\"ABj\">The property of Caldwell was sold, in this case, under a mortgage <em>fi. fa., </em>in favor of Dickson, and under two <em>fi. fas., </em>in favor of the State, issued by the Comptroller General against Caldwell, as a defaulting agent of the road. The <em>fi. fa. </em>in favor of Dickson, was an older lien than the <em>fi. fas. </em>in favor of the State; and would have been entitled to the money, if this had been a contest between two individuals. But in a contest between the State and an individual, we hold that she takes precedence, without regard to the date of the lien. 8 <em>Ga. R., </em>479; 11 <em>Ga., </em>364; 37 <em>Ga., </em>240; Revised Code, 2494, and Statutes above quoted.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-11\">It is insisted by the counsel for Dickson, that his lien had attached before the passage of the Act of 1858, and that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>Act is unconstitutional as against him, because it impairs the obligation of the contract between Caldwell and Dickson. We cannot yield our assent to this doctrine. As already stated, we think this statute only declaratory of what the law was at the time of its passage. But if it were otherwise, we do not see how the <em>obligation </em>of the contract between Caldwell and Dickson, can be impaired by the assertion by the State of the priority, in the distribution of this fund, which she claims and exercises in all cases, in the collection of her revenues.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
