If a passenger on a railroad be injured by a collision of the trains, and tbe evidence shows that, though the company (or it agents), was guilty of negligence, yet the-party injured could, by the exercise of ordinary diligence, have avoided the consequences to himself of that negligence, he is not entitled to recover any damages from the company.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b417-8\">2. If, in such a case, it appears that both the defandant and the plaintiff were guilty of negligence, and it does not further appear, from the evidence, that the deceased could, at the time of the injury, have avoided the consequence to himself of the negligence of the railroad company, or its agents, he is entitled to recover; but it is the duty of the jury to lessen the amount of their-verdict in proportion to the negligence and want of ordinary care of the passenger.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b417-9\">2.

In this ease, this Court feels constrained to reverse the judgment of the Court below, overruling the motion for a new trial, made by the plaintiff in error, on the ground that the Court erred in its charge to the jury, as to the rule for estimating damages in such cases, and on the further ground, that the verdict of the jury was decidedly against the weight of evidence, if not as to the absence of ordinary diligence on the part of the deceased, to escape the consequence to himself from the plaintiff\u2019s negligence, certainly as to the amount of the damages, in view of the rule that where both parties are at fault, the damages are to be diminished in proportion to the negligenee and want of ordinary care of the party injured.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b418-10\">Case. Motion for new trial. Decided by Judge Cole. Bibb Superior Court. November Term, 1867.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b418-11\">Arthur <em>W. </em>Johnson was a passenger upon the night passenger train from Macon to Atlanta, over the railroad of said company. That train was followed by a freight train. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>Some portion of its engine having broken, the passenger train was stopped. -Whilst it was stopped, Johnson stood upon the platform of one of its cars, and there remained till the freight train, running into the passenger train, killed him. Thereupon, his wife sued the company for damages.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b419-4\">The main question being, who was in fault, the parties read the evidence of very many persons. The plaintiff undertook to show that these trains were out of schedule <em>time; </em>that the officers of the company had violated some of its rules, and that the signal-man, sent back to give notice to the freight train, had gone back too short a distance, etc. On the other hand, the company undertook to show that Johnson was drinking; did show that he stood upon the rear platform of the rear car of the passenger train, etc. One of the witnesses said: \u201c It is my opinion Johnson could <em>not </em>have been in his seat at the moment of collision, but was at the door or \u00f3n the platform.\u201d The plaintiff's attorneys objected to this answer, as evidence, but the Court received it. It was shown that on the doors of each passenger car was a plate, with raised letters, as follows : \u25a0\u201c <em>Passengers must not stand on the platform.\u201d </em>George W. Adams, who had long been conversant witli other railroads, but who was never employed on the Macon and Western railroad, was allowed, over the defendant's objection, to testify that on railroads with which\u2019 he had been connected, the object of such notices on the doors of the passengercars, was only to keep passengers off the platforms when the train was in motion. He, also testified that a collision could not occur where both trains are off schedule time, without fault on the part of the railroad company. This, too, came in over the defendant\u2019s objections. None of the passengers who were inside the cars were damaged seriously, if at all, and quite a number .of the witnesses testified that they believed that had Johnson been inside, he had not been injured. To these opinions, the plaintiff objected, but her objections were \u2019 overruled. But when- the defendant proposed to read, from the answers of one of its witnesses, that <em>\u201c </em>it was the general opinion of passengers that all was done that could be done <em>to </em>prevent <em>the</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b419-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>accident, and that there was a card issued and signed by many of the passengers, exonerating the agents of the company from all blame,\u201d the Court rejected that answer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b420-5\">The card alluded to was in the following words:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b420-6\">\u201cA CARD.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b420-7\">\u201cMacon and Western Railroad, October 27th. 1865.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b420-8\">\u201c We, the undersigned, passengers of the train which left Macon on the night of the 26th of October, and which train was run into by a freight trian following, causing the death of A.

It had been published in the Macon Telegraph, and the original had been lost. It was made and signed on the spot, just after the catastrophe, but how long after, did not appear. (The company\u2019s attorneys, in the bill of exceptions, say it was fifteen or twenty minutes after- the catastrophe.) Under these circumstances, they offered it in evidence, but the Court refused to allow it to be read to the jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b420-11\">We pass to the question of the amount of damages.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b420-12\">The plaintiff\u2019s attorneys asked a witness the following questions: \u201c In your answer to a former set of interrogatories propounded to you by plaintiff, you stated that you thought the services of Arthur W. Johnson were worth $1,500 00 or $2,000 00 <em>per annum, </em>did you mean to say that his services were worth that sum, exclusive of the support of his family ?\u201d The question was objected to as leading. The Court held it was not leading, and the witness answered that he meant he could make that much \u201cclear of the support of his family.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b420-13\">Johnson was shown to have been between thirty and thirty-four years old when killed; most of the witnesses said about thirty-four. He had been a merchant, etc., and the witnesses who testified as to his income, put it from $1,500 00 to $2,500 00 <em>per annum.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b421-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>The returns of his property for taxation, made by himself, for a series of years, were as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b421-4\">For 1854,.........$ 865 00</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b421-5\">\u201c 1855,......... 530 00</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b421-6\">\u201c 1856,......... 1,300 00</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b421-7\">\u201c 1857,........ 2,900 00</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b421-8\">\u201c 1858,......... 3,950 00</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b421-9\">\u201c 1859,......... 10,987 00</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b421-10\">\u201c 1860,......... 13,044 00</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b421-11\">For 1861,.!.........$14,715 00</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b421-12\">\u201c 1862,........... 13,590 00</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b421-13\">\u201c 1863,........... 18,612 00</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b421-14\">\u201c 1864,........... 24,760 00</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b421-15\">\u201c 1865,...........No Return.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b421-16\">\u201c 1866, his estate, 4,450 00</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b421-17\">The inventory of the real and personal estate, made by his administrators, footed up $4,801 50.

Two witnesses estimated this as high as $3,000 00, another said $2,000 00, by his first marriage, and he did not know how much by his second, which occurred in 186 \u2014 . He was shown to have been industrious, of good habits generally, etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b421-18\">To arrive at the <em>quantum </em>of damages from these <em>data, </em>John M. B\u00d3ardman and Charles T. McCay were examined as experts. Boardman testified that he had been, since. 1854, a life insurance agent; had examined \u201cBartlett\u2019s Commercial Tables,\u201d and found them correct; that it contained a table of annuities, which was correct, and recognized as authority; that they were founded on the Carlisle Tables, which were gotten up at Carlisle, England, and generally received as authority by insurance men; that from these tables, counting interest at seven per cent., and allowing nothing for parts of annual income being added to the capital, he calculated the value of the life of a healthy man, thirty-four years old, upon an annual income of $2,000 00, to be $22,-749 57; of $700 00 income, to be $7,962 35; of $50 00 income, to be $568 73.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b421-19\">Charles F. McCay\u2019s testimony was as follows: The first question was to show his experience, etc., in such calculations, and the response to it, was as follows: \u201c I was professor of mathematics in the University of Georgia, and in the State College of South Carolina for many years, and since 1849, have been actuary or mathematician to The Southern Mutual</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b422-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>Life Insurance Company.' While I was at Athens and Columbia, I had the libraries enriched with all the standard works on the statistics of human mortality, and devoted much attention to the subject. I prepared, at various times, articles on these subjects, for Hunt\u2019s Merchant\u2019s Magazine, , which have received commendation from the best judges in the United States. Last year, I was invited by the superintendent of the Insurance Department of the State of New York, to give him my opinion of the proper method for valuing the liabilities of their-Life Insurance Companies, for my answers to which, I have received his thanks, and I subjoin the approval of the same from Mr. Bradley, actuary of the Mutual Benefit Life Insurance Company, which is one of the largest in the Union. I regard myself, therefore, as qualified by my education and studies, to give reliable answers to any question connected with life contingencies, especially in the South, where the rate of mortality is probably greater than in \u2022 the North, as is shown by the experience of the Southern Mutual Life Insurance Company, to which I have devoted careful attention:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b422-5\">\u201c Newark, N.

Now, what sum in gross, would, in money ? be equivalent to those depending on such person for the loss of this life?\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b423-5\"><em>Answer. </em>\u2014 \u201c The answer to this question depends, I think, on several other things besides the value of an annuity on the life of the deceased; for 1st, if the deceased had lived, his earnings would be partly consumed in his own support; and 2d, the earnings would not probably be continued the same until the end of life \u2014 as when old age had overtaken him, he would not be as able to labor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AJA\">\u201cAs to the first, the share that would have been consumed in his own support, I would remark that when a man\u2019s income is three, four, five, or six hundred dollars , all is usually consumed in the support of himself and family, and about a fourth or fifth of this, is usually his own expense. If he receives $1,000 00 or $1,500 00, he spends more, but lays by something.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b423-7\">. \u201c If he earns a larger sum, his savings are usually larger. The expenditures on his own support, when he receives $2,250 00, are probably less than a fifth. But I shall estimate them at a fifth in my calculation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b423-8\">\u201cAs to the second question \u2014 when his earnings would probably cease. I think at the age of.sixty, is a fair supposition. When an income depends on manual labor\u2019, it lasts usually till near this age. Where it comes from brains or mental skill or dexterity, it lasts till after sixty.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b423-9\">\u201c Counting, now, the mortality of Georgia at such a per centage above the European as I believe justified by experience; counting interest at seven .percent, per annum; counting the deceased\u2019s income at $2,250 00, the average of the $1,500 00, and $3,000 00 named in the question; counting this income to cease at the age of sixty; counting his portion of the expenditure for his own support at one-fifth of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>whole income, and counting that to be expended for his whole life, I find the loss to his family to be $17,672 00. If the jury shall be satisfied that his income is a larger or a smaller sum, this loss to be increased or diminished in proportion.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b424-5\"><em>Third Interrogatory. </em>\u2014 \u201cIn making this calculation of estimate, do you consider the question as equivalent to the purchase of a life-annuity of such person for same sum, or what is the difference ?\u201d <em>Answer. </em>\u2014 \u201c I do not consider, for the reason already given, the value of an annuity of $2,250 00 for his life, the true measure of the pecuniary loss to his family. The value of such annuity would be $26,356 00.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b424-6\"><em>Fourth Interrogatory. </em>\u2014 \u201c \"Would a sum of money, in gross, that would produce a certain life-annuity for such person for same sum, compensate pecuniarily for the loss of such life ? If not, what is the difference, and why?\u201d <em>Answer. </em>\u2014 \u201cI think such a sum of money as would produce. an annuity of $2,250 00, would more than compensate his family, for various reasons already given.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b424-7\"><em>Fifth Interrogatory. </em>\u2014 \u201c In. a life-annuity, the recipient takes the money himself, at the end of the year, and makes such disposition as he thinks proper. Now, in compensating for the loss of the life stated, ought not the consideration to increase the compensation that this person, whose intellect, capacity, and sagacity produces this sum in life, and puts into his business annually, increasing, to this extent, his profits and benefits to his family, while no such consideration affects the price for an-annuity producing a like sum, and if this is true, what sum is equivalent to this additional consideration?\u201d <em>Answer. </em>\u2014 \u201cIf the deceased had, extraordinary skill in money matters, the jury would be justified in increasing my estimate. I merely count money worth legal interest.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b424-9\">As to Bartlett\u2019s Tables, etc., he said he knew nothing of them, and that no old tables, as the Northampton, Carlisle, or Swedish, nor modern tables, as \u201cDr. Farr\u2019s English,\u201d founded on the mortality of England and Wales, would suit exactly for the latitude of Georgia.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b424-10\">Upon cross-examination, he answered: \u201cThe constitution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>and health of a person have much to do with the duration of life. My calculations above are based \"on the average of the whole community, good and bad. The English tables of Dr. Earr are based on the whole population, sick and well, weak and sound. My table of mortality is higher than this, because of our Southern latitude, nearly twenty-five per cent.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b425-4\">\u201c I think a reliable estimate can be made of the value of an annuity on one\u2019s life without knowing his constitution. If the deceased was in good health \u2014 not meaning by this perfect health, or free from every complaint or disorder \u2014 not below the average health of the whole population of the State, I consider that .his loss to his family was worth, at least, the sum named in my direct answer, $17,762 00, and that this valuation is founded on principles perfectly reliable. If the jury shall be satisfied that the deceased was in bad health, then I withdraw my calculation as not applicable. If he was in good health, whatever was his constitution, I consider my calculation reliable. Millions and tens of millions of money are invested in the United States on just such calculations, and they are as safely invested as if put into State or railroad bonds.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b425-5\">To the 3d cross-interrogatory he answered : \u201c It is usual to have a medical examination of any person who applies for life insurance, or a life-annuity. But it is not usual to reject the application for slight disorders. I have had my own life insured when my application showed that I had been much troubled with dyspepsia, and without any extra charge. Piles, asthma, and hernia, and other diseases of slight character, do not prevent the acceptance of an applicant. The tables of mortality which insurance companies use, include all such persons. If only the perfect cases were taken, the rate of mortality would be below their tables and calculations.\u201d)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b425-7\">To the 4th cross-interrogatory he answers: <em>\u201c </em>I have no personal knowledge of the income or health of Arthur W. Johnson. I only say, in my answers above, that, if he was in good health, and thirty-four years of age, and had an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>income of $2,250 00 a year, the pecuniary loss to his family was $17,672 00, (seventeen thousand six hundred and seventy-two dollars.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b426-5\">To the 5th cross-interrogatory he answers: \u201cI have nothing to add in favor of defendant, as I had nothing to add in favor of plaintiff. Knowing none of the parties, my answers relate only to abstract scientific questions, without reference to particular individuals.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b426-7\">The evidence being closed, the Court first gave to the jury a general charge, as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b426-8\">This case is brought by plaintiff to recover of the defendant, damages for the killing of her husband, while a passenger on the cars of defendant. You have heard the evidence, and you are to determine the case from the evidence and the law as I shall give it to you. You are the sole judges of the evidence, and you are to sift it, and weigh it, and apply it to the law. If there is a conflict in the evidence, you are to reconcile it, and make it harmonize if you can. But if you cannot harmonize it, then scrutinize it, and give your credence to that part that is best sustained by other witnesses, and giving to the evidence of the witnesses that had the best opportunity of knowing, and are sustained by the greatest weight of other evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b426-9\">Again, you are to disregard any and every consideration but the law and evidence. You are to be blind as to who are the parties, where they reside, or what are their necessities. Make your verdict speak the truth from the law and evidence as submitted to you.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b426-10\">This defendant was a carrier of passengers, and was bound to extraordinary diligence on behalf of itself and agents, to protect the lives and persons of its passengers. \u25a0 The defendant was obliged to furnish good and substantial and safe engine and cars, and good, competent and skillful engineers and other officers, agents and servants. If the defendant fails to furnish all these, and a passenger is injured in consequence thereof, the defendant is liable to the passenger for such damages as he can prove he has sustained.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b426-11\">If the jury believe, from the evidence in this case, that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>husband of the plaintiff was killed by the neglect of the defendant in providing any of these things; or, if they believe from the evidence, that the husband was killed by an extraordinary and unforeseen collision, which was the result of the negligence or want of diligence on the part of defendant, or its agents, and without any want of ordinary care on the part of the husband who was killed, then the plaintiff is entitled to recover.

By that Act, the right of action was given to the \u201c <em>legal representatives </em>of such deceased, to have and maintain an action at law against the person committing the act from which the death has resulted, one-half of the recovery to be paid to the wife and children, or the husband of the deceased, if any, in case of his or her estate being insolvent.\u201d This Act was subsequently amended, and by section 2920, (new Code), it is provided that, \u201c A widow, or if no widow, a child or children, may'recover for the homicide of the husband or parent; and if suit be brought by the widow or children, and the former, or one of the latter dies pending the \u00e1ction, the same shall survive, in the first case, to the children, and in the latter case, to the surviving child or children.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"123\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b437-5\">By this legislation, it appears that, at first, a right of action was given to the legal representatives of the deceased in such cases, <em>in part </em>for the benefit of the deceased\u2019s estate, and <em>in part </em>for the benefit of his wife and children, if he died insolvent. By the last Act, the right of action is taken away from the legal representatives, and the cause of action, <em>as far as the estate is concerned, </em>is put upon a footing with all other torts, and does not survive -to his representatives. This last provision of the law looks alone to the widow, and if no widow, to the child or children, husband or father.</p>\n<p data-order=\"124\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b437-6\">This view is sustained by the high authority of the English Courts, construing the Act 9 and 10 Victoria, which is very similar in its provisions to our own law. There, the-right of action is given to the legal representative, but it is <em>for the benefit </em>of the family. In the case of Blake vs. Midland Railway Company, 83, English Common Law Reports, the income of the deceased was calculated at \u00bf\u00a3850 a year. \u201cThe learned Judge suggested to the jury, as a mode of estimating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>the pecuniary loss, to take so much per annum <em>of that sum as a wife living with her husband, and maintained according to her station in life, might be supposed to enjoy.\u201d </em>The jury found a verdict of \u00bf64,000. A new trial was granted, on the ground that the damages were excessive. The same doctrine was held by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, that the widow could recover the pecuniary loss sustained by her, viz: \u201ca reasonable support and maintenance for herself.\u201d Pennsylvania Railroad Company vs. Kelly, 31 Pennsylvania State, 373.

The verdict was for the plaintiff. The defendant moves for a new trial, on the ground, first, of error in the Court in admitting and in excluding testimony, but mainly on the ground that the Court erred in his charge to the jury as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>the measure of damages, and on the ground that the verdict of the jury was contrary to the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\">The plaintiff moves for a new trial on several minor grounds, but mainly on the ground that the Court erred in charging the jury, (this being a suit against a railroad company for the homicide of a passenger,) that the plaintiff could not recover if her husband, by the exercise of ordinary care, could have avoided the consequences to himself of the defendant\u2019s negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">1. It. is true that there is a' special title in the Code, sections 2978 to 2985, concerning damages by railroads, and that there are several more stringent rules provided against railroad companies, regulating their liability for damages, than are provided against individuals. We do not, however, see any reason why the general principles contained in sections 2917 to 2921, should not apply to physical injuries by railroads. Indeed, it is from section 2920 that the plaintiff in this case gets her right to recover at all. The rule, section 2921, <em>\u201c </em>If the plaintiff, by ordinary care, could have avoided the injury to himself, caused by the defendant\u2019s negligence, he cannot recover at all,\u201d applies, in our opinion, to all cases, and it is a wise and just rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">The man who neglects ordinary care to <em>avoid </em>an injury, has no just right to seek redress, if that injury is produced by the negligence of another, and we see nothing in the character of a railroad company which should subject it to damages for an injury caused by the neglect of its agents, where the person injured might, by the exercise of ordinary care, have <em>avoided </em>the consequences to himself. It is objected that this is a harsh rule, and it is even contended, that, though in the Code, it is not law, because beyond, the power of the compilers, who were not authorized to <em>make- </em>law. If. is sufficient for this, to say, that both the Constitutions of 1865 and 1868 adopt the Code, and it is not worth while to discuss the extent of the powers of the compilers. Nor is this rule less hard upon the defendant than was the common law. Mr. Pearce, American Railroad Law, 272, announces it as a general principle of the common law, \u201cThat the rule resulting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>from all the authorities is, that a party suffering injury by a collision, cannot recover if he was himself chargeable with a want of ordinary care, and thereby contributed to the injury. And in Laing vs. Colder, 8th Barr, it was decided, <em>\u201c </em>That the company is not chargeable for an injury to a passenger which would not have occurred ,but for his own negligence, or to which his own negligence substantially contributed, notwithstanding, the company itself is chargeable with a breach of duty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">Our own Courts, previously to the Code, had substantially adopted the same rule, and in 19 <em>Ga. R., </em>440, this Court, in effect, announces the rule as it exists in this section of the Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">Our Code, sec. 2970, requires a railroad company to prove, affirmatively, diligence on its part, and declares that the presumption is, in all cases, against the company. It also provides, sec. 2980, that \u201c if the complainant and the- agents of the company are both at fault, the former may recover, but the damages shall be diminished by the jury, in proportion to the amount of default attributable to each of the parties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">The common law rule was, that however negligent the defendant may have been, yet, if the negligence of the plaintiff <em>contributed </em>to the injury of the plaintiffj he was without remedy. Sedgwick on Damages, 468.</p>\n<p id=\"AEcG\">There could be at common law no apportionment of damages. See cases cited, Pierce on Am. R. R. Law, 272-275; Angel on Carriers, 642. A wrong-doer himselfj who has contributed to an injury sustained, can not ask for redress. 8 Man., and Gran &amp; Scott, 114.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-10\">2. Our Code, however, in the case of railroads, adopts a different rule, and provides, in certain- eases, for an apportionment of the damages according to the fault of both parties. This, as is said by Judge Benning, in 26 <em>Ga., 250, </em>was the English Admiralty rule, and, taken in connection with the rule in sec. 2921 of the Code, is wise and just. As a matter of course, these rules are to be taken together. Mere want of ordinary care, on the part of the plaintiff, will not relieve the defendant, unless <em>he </em>be totally free from fault. Taken <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>together, as we understand the two sections, sec. 2921 and sec. 2980, the rule in Georgia is this: <em>\u201c </em>If the plaintiff, by the exercise of ordinary care, could have <em>avoided </em>the consequences to himself of the defendant\u2019s negligence, he can not recover at all. But in other cases, (that is, in cases where, by ordinary care, he could <em>not </em>have avoided the consequences of defendant\u2019s negligence,) the circumstance that the plaintiff may have, in some way, contributed to the injury sustained, shall not entirely relieve the defendant, but the damages shall be apportioned according to the amount of default attributable to each. And it seems to us, that the Code thus happily settles a subject upon which there has been some conflict of opinion, and no little display of learning and argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">3. We have not been able to agree with the Court below as to the rule to be adopted for estimating the damages which the wife has suffered by the homicide of the husband. This is a new question not only in Georgia, but wherever the common law is in force. The right to sue at all, depends upon the statute, and the rights of the parties must turn upon its terms. Our first Act gave the right to sue to the administrator, and enacted that, if the estate was insolvent, one-half the recovery should be paid by him to the wife and children. Act 23d February, 1850. The Act of 1856, declared the right to vest in the wife, if any; if not, in the children, and if none, in the legal representatives.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">Under these Acts, we are inclined to think it was the intention of the Legislature to give a remedy for the full value of the deceased\u2019s life. But the Code drops the legal representatives altogether, and gives the right only in case of the homicide of a <em>husband or </em>parent, and only to the widow, or, if none, to the children. Code, sec. 2920. This change in the law is significant. Why is no remedy given, except in case of the death of a husband or parent, and why are the representatives dropped ? Simply, as it seems to us, because it was intended only to give to the wife damages for <em>her </em>loss, or, if no wife, then to the children, for <em>their </em>loss. What, then, is the loss of the wife ? Her legal loss ? It is that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>which she was, by law, entitled to from her husband, a. reasonable support, according to his condition in life. We are aware that this is but a poor compensation for the loss of a loved one. But would any pecuniary rule meet the actual damages? We trow not, and we do not suppose anything was intended, by the Legislature, but to supply the loss to the wife of her actual legal rights, by the death of her husband. Anything more than this, would set us adrift, without chart or compass. The real value of a life, is incalculable, and its actual money-value is all that can be estimated. But neither the wife nor the children have any legal <em>right </em>in the earnings of the husband or parent, except for a reasonable support, according to his condition in life. He may, it is true, give them more, or, if he dies without disposing of his estate, they will inherit it. But they have, in law, no. pecuniary interest, no legal right in his property, except, as we have said, for a reasonable support, according to his condition in life. This, they have a right to demand, and this, in our judgment, will, upon the whole, best satisfy the peculiar language of the Code, and the history of the legislation in this State on this subject. In estimating the damages, therefore, in a case where the wife is suing for the homicide of her husband, who was without fault, the jury are to inquire what would be a reasonable support for the wife, -according to the circumstances in life of the husband, as they existed at his death, and as they may be reasonably supposed to exist in the future, in view of his character, habits occupation, and prospects in life, and when the annual money-value of that support has been found, to give, as damages, its present worth, according to the expectation of life of the deceased, as ascertained by the mortuary tables of established reputation. This-rule, as we believe, will approach nearly to a means of measuring the actual legal money-value of the life to the wife, though we do not pretend that it will, at all, compensate her for the loss of her husband \u2014 that, money, to any amount, cannot do, and it is vain to attempt it.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">We have said nothing as to the children, and are free to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>say that their <em>status, </em>in an action of this kind, has given us much trouble. In the estimate of damages, ought they to be considered? The statute is not clear upon the subject. If the widow recovers, she recovers in her <em>own name, </em>and she holds the recovery in her <em>own right. </em>The children have no claim upon it. She may marry, and thus convey it t\u00f3 a stranger, or dispose of it at her pleasure. Why should any claim of theirs be considered in a suit by the wife? On the other hand, if there be no widow, the children may sue, and if she die pending her action, the <em>same </em>shall survive to the children. Code, sec. 2920. And it is also true that, by the homicide of the husband, an additional moral, if not legal, duty is cast'upon her for the support, at least, of minor children. In the decision of the Court, at the head of this opinion, we have said nothing about the child or children, believing that, in a suit by the wife, <em>her </em>loss is the only matter for consideration. The statute is very meagre in its provisions. It does not provide full remedies, and we do not feel authorized to extend it beyond its terms. We hope the Legislature may make the law, upon this subject, more precise. \u2022 What is so uncertain as children? Does it mean minor children only, or all children ? In a matter of such importance, the law ought to be clear, and as the right here given, is one wholly the.creation of the Legislature, we hope it may be more accurately defined by that body. On principles of justice, the widow and children stand on the same footing; yet, as the right of action is given only to the widow, the recovery will be for her sole' benefit. We do not feel, therefore, that the rights of the children, or the damage to them, where the suit is by the widow, is matter for consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-4\">4. An experienced railroad man, who has made the management of cars, engines, etc., his business for years, is as fairly an expert as one skilled in any other art, and his evidence stands upon the same footing. We think, however, that the explanation by Mr. Adams, of the meaning which the railroad companies with which he had been connected attached to the notice that \u201c passengers must not stand on the platform,\u201d was not proper evidence. The words stand <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>for themselves. Suppose he had undertaken to explain by stating that they <em>meant </em>something more, instead of something less than their plain import. Ought that, too, <em>to </em>be evidence ? The facts of this case show that the platform is not a safe place, even when the car is not in motion. The .old rule is the safe one. Let the words speak for themselves. If the door is opened at all, there is no limit. 1 Greenleaf Ev., sec 280.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">5. The precise position of Mr. Johnson, at the moment of the collision, is not positively known. He was found on the ground; he had been on the platform very shortly before. The witnesses stated the facts, where they saw him and where he was found. It is sometimes very difficult to draw the line between what is evidence, as a fact, and what is a conclusion of the witness. Much of what we state as fact, is, in truth, only the conclusion of our minds from very conclusive evidence. The statement that a man remained an hour in a room, may safely be made by one who saw him go in and come out, and who, having good opportunities, failed to see him come out in the mean time, and yet after all it may be, and is, a mere conclusion. <em>We </em>think the <em>opinion </em>of the witness is not evidence. If the witness <em>state </em>the presence of the deceased on the platform, at the moment of the collision, <em>as a fact, </em>and it afterwards appear that this is only his conclusion, from his presence there immediately before and his position afterwards, we think his evidence ought not be excluded. His statement of the <em>fact </em>is weakened, it is true, but it is often very difficult to draw the line, when, in such a matter, fact ends and opinion begins. <em>We </em>do not think there is any danger that the jury should be misled. If his statement is only given as opinion, it is inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">6. The card was, without doubt, inadmissible. All the parties to it were competent witnesses. It might be used, perhaps, to contradict or qualify the evidence of any witness who signed it, if proper foundation was laid, as in case of other statements, but not as original evidence. <em>We </em>know of no rule that justifies its admission. It is not even the state<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>ment of one of the parties to the issue. As a part of the <em>res gestee, </em>it must have been <em>during </em>the occurrence, or so nearly coincident as to be free from all suspicion of after thought. Code,, sec. 3720. <em>This </em>was next day, and after much dispute and crimination, and, as the other evidence shows, <em>against </em>the <em>first </em>impressions of the passengers.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">7. The liability of a common carrier, for injury to a passenger, is somewhat different from his liability for goods. The latter he stores away at his own discretion, the former is a sentient being, and has certain duties of his own to perform. The company may make reasonable rules to regulate the conduct of its passengers, and it is the duty of passengers to comply with those rules. Code, 2043. More especially is this true, when the rule is for the passenger\u2019s own safety. The platform, as is plain to the meanest capacity, is not made to stand upon. The company provides seats, and a shelter for its passengers, and the platform is, as to them, but the passway to their proper place; and it is a reasonable and proper rule, which the company may prescribe, that passengers should not stand upon the platform. It is a rule for the railroad\u2019s own convenience; passengers are in the way, a hindrance to the proper management of the train, in that position. It is also true, that it is a place of danger. Whilst the cars are running it is emphatically so, but even when the cars are not in motion, it is an unsafe place.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">8. The evidence of the notice was very strong; sufficient to cast the <em>onus </em>of want of knowledge on the plaintiff. Indeed, at this day, considering the familiarity of all classes-with railroads, and' the evidence which the very nature of the case offers, it would seem that, <em>prima facie, </em>every person ought to know that the platform is not a passenger\u2019s place, except to pass over. Suppose one were to stand on the steps, or mount the railing, or get on the top of the car, would not the presumption be against him ?</p>\n<p id=\"b445-8\">We cannot-but think that the jury in this case have not given due consideration to the negligence of the deceased. The evidence is conclusive that he was on the platform, and that his position was, in fact, the occasion of his death. There <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>is evidence, too, that he was warned <em>by one of the company\u2019s employees </em>of the impending danger, in time to have avoided the consequences; others did avoid it, under the same warning. We are not disposed, however, to hold a man, under such circumstances, to the same coolness and wisdom of action as after the event, and as calm spectators, we may think we would have made use of. Something, perhaps much, must be allowed for alarm and confusion and temperament. We do not, therefore, hold that, under the evidence, it is clear he could have avoided, by ordinary care, the consequences of the defendant\u2019s negligence.. We do think, however, that though the company was at fault, the deceased was also very careless, nay reckless. He had no business on the platform, it was a place of danger, and always is. It was known to him that a train was coming. He was warned by several of the danger, and ordered by one of the company\u2019s employees to get off, as danger was imminent.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">9. After the warning, and after he heard the coming train, a passenger went into the car, got his valise, came out, again warned the deceased, got off the train, went to the side of the track, saw the coming train, and again, in a loud voice, gave warning; and yet, deceased, foolishly or recklessly, stood his ground. It is, too, a significant fact, that he had been drinking, and was on the platform, with his hat off. We think both parties were at fault, and, under sec. 2980 of the Code, the damages ought to be diminished by the jury,, in proportion to the fault of each.. We do not think the jury has done this. We would not measure their verdict with accuracy. The jury are the judges of the facts, and it is only when they are so wide of the mark as to indicate passion, mistake, or some error, based upon misunderstanding of law, that a court ought to interfere. We think, in this case, under the evidence, as it is before us in the record, the jury have either mistaken the law, or have acted under the influence of passion, natural, perhaps, in view of the parties, but still, illegal. In view of all the facts, and of the law, as we understand it, we think the verdict is wrong, and the damages, under the evidence, excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
