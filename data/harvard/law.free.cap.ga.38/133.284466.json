The Court below held that Kaufman could so discharge his said promise. This Court reversed that judgment, and ordered a new trial. See <em>37th Geo. B., </em>601.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b141-12\">When the case went to trial again, the plaintiffs asked for a verdict for the amount pf rent admitted to be due, in Amer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>ican gold coin, <em>plus </em>the admitted premium on American gold coin, in greenbacks. The defendants\u2019 attorney objected to this, and asked the Court to charge the jury that a distress-warrant is an execution, and can only issue for. money generally; that though the contract in this case may have been specific, yet, the plaintiffs, having elected a distress-warrant as their form of i\u2019emedy, could not, in that form of proceeding, recover more than the amount expressed therein in the legal currency of the country, known as United States legal tender treasury notes.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b142-4\">The Court refused so to charge, but charged that this case, having been carried to the Supreme Court, and the decision of the City Court having been reversed, the judgment of the Supreme Court should govern all similar cases, and was the special law of this case, and that they should find in accord- ' anee with said Supreme Court decision; that under said decision, plaintiffs could recover, in that form of action, the market value of the sum of money, in American gold coin, which they claimed to be due. The jury found accordingly.

This case was before this Court at the last term, when the j udgment of the Court below was reversed, and a new trial ordered, upon the ground that the Court erred in holding, that a contract for the payment of a specific sum, in American gold coin, could be discharged by the payment of the same nominal sum, in what is generally known as United States legal tender treasury notes. Upon the new trial, in the Court below, that Court charged the jury in conformity with the law as ruled by this Court in that particular case. There was no error in the charge of the Court below upon that point.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
