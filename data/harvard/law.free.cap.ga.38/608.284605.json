The ninth by-law of this corporation is a legal and proper one, in view of the objects of the society ; but the society has not an uncontrollable discretion in its construction and enforcement.

Chatham Superior Court. January Term, 1869.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b616-13\">James J. Waring filed in the Superior Court of Chatham -county/his petition for a writ of <em>mandamus, </em>with certain exhibits and affidavits, averring the following facts: * * * * * By an Act of the General Assembly of the State of Georgia, assented to December 12th, 1804, \u201cThe Georgia Medical Society\u201d was duly incorporated for the purposes in said act mentioned, and with the powers and -privileges therein specified. The principal place of business of said corporation is in the said county.

At a regular meeting of the said corporation, on the second day of September, 1868, the committee, whose names were signed to said charges and specifications, made a report of their action; at said meeting Waring excepted to said charges and specifications, as being contrary to law, and it was determined by the said corporation that the committee give the names of parties referred to in said charges and specifications.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b617-4\">At a subsequent meeting of the said corporation, on the 30th day of September, 1868, Waring was tried for the matters contained in said charges and specifications; he again excepted to the right of the corporation to try him as aforesaid, and the corporation found him guilty as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b617-5\">Specification 1st, charge 1st, guilty; specification 2d, charge 1st, guilty; charge 1st, guilty; specification 1st, charge 2d, guilty; specification 2d, charge 2d, guilty; charge 2d, guilty. And not guilty as follows: Specification 3d, charge 2d, not guilty.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b617-6\">A vote for his expulsion from said corporation having then been defeated, it was moved and carried that he be notified by a committee appointed for that purpose, that, after due deliberation, he had been found guilty of the charges and specifications as above stated; he considers this deliberate action of the society as the gravest censure; notwithstanding this decision of the said corporation, it was further moved, and carried, that he be brought before the society, informed of the decision, and censured by the president. To this last censure he objected, and left the room in which the meeting was being held, but returning in a few moments, stated that after considering the matter he would receive the censure.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b617-7\">At the next regular meeting of said corporation, on the seventh day of October, 1868, it was resolved that the presence of Waring being detrimental to the interest of the society he be requested to tender his resignation on or before the next regular meeting of the same, which proposition he declined ; at the meeting thereafter of the said corporation, on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>the 14fch day of October, 1868, the following preamble and resolutions were offered and passed, viz :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b618-5\"><em>\u201c Whereas, </em>at a meeting of the Georgia Medical Society, held on October, 7th, 1868, at the residence of Dr. J.

It is a <em>private civil corporation: </em>See Act of Incorporation. The College of Physicians in London, incorporated for the purpose of improving the science of medicine, held to be a <em>private civil corporation: 1 </em>Blackstone\u2019s Com., Marg. p. 471. This Medical Society, though a private corporation, has for its objects matters of public interest \u2014 for the public have an interest in the improvement of the science of medicine and the lessening of the fatality induced by climate and incidental causes: 4 Burr., 2186-7-8; Ur. Askew\u2019s case. The Legislature declares the Act of Incorporation to be a public act, thus declaring their opinion that the public were interested: See Public and Private Acts, 1 Blackstone\u2019s Com. This, then, being a <em>private civil corporation, </em>it is subject to no visitorial power save that of the Superior Court of this county, which is the same as the King\u2019s Bench in England, \u201c where, and where only, all misbehaviours of this kind of corporations are .inquired into and redressed and all their controversies decided:\u201d 1 Blackstone\u2019s Com., Marg. p. 481; 2 John. Chan. R., 335, etc. (Kent\u2019s decisions). But, if this be a private eleemosynary corporation, the original founders, becoming themselves the corporators, and having no one to visit, can not be both <em>visitors </em>and <em>'visited, </em>but are subject to the laws of the land administered' by the courts: Darmouth College, 4 Wheat., 674-5; Plainfield Academy, 6 Conn., 544-5. Each individual member of a corporation is said to have a franchise or freedom: 2 Blackstone\u2019s Com., Marg. p. 37. A franchise is property; it is an incorporated hereditament: 2 Blackstone\u2019s Com., Marg. p. 21. The privilege of membership or franchise in a corporation is property, and valuable though it have no market value: 4 Wheat., 699. 657.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b627-5\">If the relator has been deprived of this franchise, .his property, he has a clear legal right to be restored, unless he has beeen legally expelled. And this can only be attained by compelling the Georgia Medical Society, in its <em>corporate </em>and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number><em>official </em>capacity, to restore to him the rights, privilege, and franchise of a corporator. To accomplish this, <em>mandamus </em>is the remedy : 20 Pick, 495; 2 Burr, 1045 ; 3 Burr, 1265; 4 Bacon Abg., p. 500; Con. of Geo., p. 13; Code, 3142; 1st Cranch, 168 \u2014 U. S. Supreme Court. All corporate duties are <em>official duties </em>in the meaning of the Code, for in another section it declares that every corporation acts through its officers: Irwin\u2019s Code, sec. 1679; Ang. <em>&amp; </em>Ames, sec. 696-7, 8th ed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b628-5\">Section 3143 of the Code, which says that <em>mandamus </em>does not lie as a private remedy between individuals, does not mean that it will not lie between an individual and a corporation. Section 5 of the Code, which says the word <em>person, </em>when used, shall mean corporation, does not say when the word <em>individuals </em>is used it shall mean corporations; and the use of the term <em>individuals </em>instead of <em>person, </em>proves that the legislature drew the distinction. Besides, such a reading would make it applicable equally to <em>public </em>and <em>private </em>corporations.</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b628-6\">The writ is not limited to public corporations. See Angel &amp; Ames on Private Corporations, chapter on <em>mandamus, </em>and all the cases cited by relator.</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b628-7\">Nor is it limited to the enforcement of <em>public rights. </em>For it lies to be restored a member of a church; Green vs. African Methodist Church: 1st Serg\u2019t <em>&amp; </em>Rawle, 254. It lies to restore members of private corporations for charitable purposes : Com. vs. St. Patrick\u2019s Society, 2 Binney, 448 ; Com. vs. Penn. Ben. Ins., 2 Serg\u2019t &amp; Rawle. It lies to restore a corporator of a private academic corporation, though no emoluments were attached: Fuller vs. Plainfield School, 6 Conn., 532. It lies to restore a doctor to the college of physicians to <em>the franchise </em>of membership, though not to the corporate offices, Dr. Goodard\u2019s case: 4 Bacon\u2019s Abr., 507. It lies to admit one who has been found eligible to the college of physicians, which Blackstone has said, as above, to be a private civil corporation; and in this case Lord Mansfield said the respondent was a <em>corporation, </em>and, therefore, the Court had <em>jwisdiction, </em>Dr. Askew\u2019s case: 4 Burr, 2186-7-8. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>lies to compel a private corporation, the Savannah and Ogeechec Canal Company, to execute a contract and build a bridge over a private road for private use: 26 <em>Ga., </em>665. And in case of a bank, a private corporation : 12 <em>Ga., </em>178. The performance of a corporate <em>function </em>is a <em>duty </em>not to be demanded by action, but compelled by <em>mandamus: </em>2 Sel. N., P. 1083 \u2014 note, late edition; 5 Watts, 152; 4 <em>Ga., </em>44. It lies when there is a right and no other specific and adequate legal remedy : 3 Burr, 1267; 4 <em>Ga., </em>117; 12 <em>Ga., </em>178; 26 <em>Ga., </em>665. The remedy to prevent <em>mandamus </em>must be at law : Ang. <em>&amp; </em>Ames, 711; 3 Term, 651; 10 Wend., 293 ; 1 Cow., 423; 12 John., N. Y., 414. The remedy to deprive one of the writ of <em>mandamus </em>must be adequate and specific: Angel <em>&amp; </em>Ames on Cor., sec. 712; 26 <em>Ga., </em>676.</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b629-5\">Ungentlemanly conduct is not sufficient excuse for not restoring him or proper for expelling him. The difference between amotion which relates to the removal of <em>corporate officers </em>and <em>disfranchisement, </em>which is the taking away of the <em>franchise, the property </em>of the corporator: 2 Kent, 298; Wilcock on Mun. Cor., 150; Grant on Cor. In a corporation of this kind, and particularly where there is joint property, a corporator can not be disfranchised unless the authority is expressly given in the charter : 2 Kent, 298; Dartmouth College, 4 Wheat., 675-6; Bowdoin College, 1 Sumner, 301; Plainfield Academy, 6 Conn., 545-6; 2 Raymond, 1566; Ang. &amp; Ames on Cor., chap. 12, secs. 408 and 409, 8th ed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b629-6\">The <em>incidental </em>or <em>implied </em>power of <em>amotion </em>has been determined to exist for three causes: 1st. Where the officer has been guilty of some offence which is infamous and has been convicted by a jury. 2d. Where he has been guilty of some offence against his oath of office and duty as a corpora-tor. 3d. Where he has been guilty of an offence of a mixed nature, that is infamous and against his duty as a corporator, such as <em>bribery: </em>2 Esp. N. P., 317-19; 1 Burr, 538; 2 Binney, 448. The cause returned, \u201cungentlemanly conduct,\u201d does not come within either of the above. Eeliance is placed upon a by-law, which the society has no authority to make, to sustain the return. 1st. Because there is no.such power <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>to make such a by-law expressly conferred in the charter; see cases above cited. 2d. Because, when the authority is incidental or implied, it must rest in the <em>whole body, </em>and this by-law gives the power to two-thirds present, when a majority of the whole must do it: 8th Term, 352; 10 Mood, 76; Cowper, 503. 3d. The by-law creates a forfeiture, and. is void: 1 Bishop Crim. L., sec. 58. 4th. The by-law is highly penal, and must be tested by the law relating to such statutes: 1 Bishop Crim. L., see. 55. It does not define ungentlemanly conduct, and therefore does not prescribe a rule of conduct: 1 Black\u2019s Com., Marg. p. 44-60. It is void for ambiguity : 1 Bishop Crim. L., sec. 55.</p>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b630-6\">The society may construe anything to be ungentlemanly conduct': Eden on Penal Laws, 309. Whenever the society interprets this by-law, and makes that punishable which the law previously permitted, they make the by-law <em>ex post </em>facto: Eden on Penal Laws, 309. The manner of construing this by-law enables the society to legislate upon the <em>social status </em>of the <em>citizen, </em>and to punish for <em>opinions, </em>which is unconstitutional : See Constitution of Georgia, secs. 9, 10. This bylaw takes away the property of relator without due process of law, and is void : Cons. of Ga., p. 1, sec. 111. If the bylaw is, then, illegal, all action under it is illegal, and the <em>mandamus </em>should be made at once peremptory: 2 Binney, 448; 1st Black.\u2019s Comm., 476, Marg. p. But if the by-law should be held legal, the return under it is still insufficient. 1st. Because it does not state that every individual member was summoned for that purpose; 2 Burr, 723 ; 1 Stra., 1051; 2 Burr, 738; Tappan on Mand., Marg. p. 201. 2d. The return should set forth all necessary facts precisely, to show that the person was removed in a legal and proper manner and for legal cause; it is not sufficient to set out <em>conclusion only: </em>2 Burr, 731; 2 Esp. N. P., 682; 1 Serg\u2019t <em>&amp; </em>Rawle, 255.</p>\n<p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b630-7\">A return in too general terms is bad, as to say that the party had absolutely refused to obey rules and orders without saying what these rules and orders were: 2 Lord Raymond, 1564; 2 Esp. N. P., 683. A return for neglect of duty has been held to be bad, without stating the particular instances <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>of neglect, that the Court may judge: 1 Stra., 58; 2 Esp. N. P., 683; Tappan on Mand., Marg. p. 199. A return which does not contain the specific charges and specifications is bad : Angel <em>&amp; </em>Ames on Cor., top page 597, 2d edition; 6 Serg\u2019t <em>&amp; </em>Rawle, 476. If this return is not good, it should be quashed, and the peremptory <em>mandamus </em>awarded : Tappan on Mand., 358-9, Marg. p.; 2 Burr, 723 ; 2 Term, 181; 3 East., 188; 8 Term, 353; 1st Serg\u2019t <em>&amp; </em>Rawle, 255; 2 Serg\u2019t &amp; Rawle, 141; 2 Binney, 449-450 ; 6 Conn., 543. Strictness not dispensed with 'in a return by the Statute of Ann : Tappan on Mand., top page 394. If the return is insffiucient there is nothing to submit to a jury.</p>\n<p data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b631-5\">But if this return is to be considered with the petition, and we are to look to it for an explanation of the words specific charges, there is still no dispute about facts, for the petition then constitutes the return. No matter what they may be called, whether ungentlemanly conduct or any other name, it is the substance, the <em>specifications, </em>not the charge, which makes the offence: <em>O\u2019Halloran vs. State of Georgia, </em>31 <em>Ga., </em>206. Nor do they come under any one of the heads above mentioned, for which a corporation can exercise the incidental power of amotion even. The act is done <em>malo animo </em>in cases giving incidental power of amotion: 2 Esp. N. P., 318. To make a crime or an offence there must be a combination of act and intent: Code of Ga., sec. 4227. The malfeasance must be infamous, such as forgery, and a conviction for an assault is not enough <em>to amove: </em>2 Esp. N. P., Marg. p. 677. The offence, if not infamous, must have some respect to \"the corporation that is detrimental to its liberties, privileges,- or franchises-: 2 Esp. N. P., marg. p. 677, No. 3. Personal offence from one member to another, or a mere <em>contempt </em>of, or contemptuous words used to, the corporation or any member, not sufficient ground of <em>amotion </em>even: 2 Esp. N. P., Marg. p. 677, No. 3; Dr. Bentley\u2019s case, 1 Strange, 557. It is not sufficient to disfranchise: 2 Binney, 448 ; 6 Conn., 544.</p>\n<p data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b631-6\">The 9th by-law itself requires that <em>specific charges </em>and specifications be handed to the accused one month before-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>action. The record shows that the relator was found guilty the night the resolutions were introduced, when he was not present. His notice was that he would be expelled unless he resigned. This was clearly <em>illegal, </em>not simply irregular : 8 Term, 352; T. U. P. Charlton, 235. The whole record shows that the action on the last charges or <em>resolutions </em>was but a reconsideration of the sentence passed upon relator after the trial upon the first charges, and, therefore, illegal and void. The case is similar to the Commonwealth vs. the Guardians of the Poor: 6 Serg\u2019t <em>&amp; </em>Rawle, 469. The traverse of respondents must be confined to facts; it cannot go to legal consequences: 2 Burr, 731, bottom of the page; Tappan on Mand., top page 393. Traverse of immaterial matter is bad: Tappan on Mand., top p. 392. All material suggestions and allegations of the writ, which are not denied or traversed by the return, are in contemplation of law admitted by respondents : Tappan on Mand., top p. 392.</p>\n<p data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b632-5\">Thomas E. Loyd replied:</p>\n<p data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b632-6\">\u2022 This is strictly a private corporation. There is nothing like emolument or pecuniary interest to any of its members contemplated. It is entirely a voluntary society, and no one has a right to membership except he be duly elected by the ballots of two-thirds of the members. The charter of incorporation from the State does not create this association. It existed before the charter. The charter gave it some privileges, but did not change the character of the association : 4 \"Wheaton, p. 638. Such being the character of this corporation, the courts will not interfere by <em>mandamus,, </em>but leave its affairs under the control of its members: Tappan on Mandamus m. p. 137, 138, m. p. 216, 217; Carthew, p. 92; 1 Modern, m. p. 83; 2 Shower, 178, 191; 2 Barn &amp; Ald, 622; 5 Barn <em>&amp; </em>Ald, 899. What right did the relator acquire by becoming a member of the corporation ? - He did not obtain a license to practice as a physician, for that is given him by the laws of Georgia: Code, sec. 1416-1424. Nor does his expulsion in any way conflict with that right. The rule with .reference to consultation gives no positive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>right, it is only negative in its character. The return discloses that there are no anatomical specimens, and but a few books, or plates, for the deprivation of which, monetary damages may be assessed in an action at law: 7 East, 353.</p>\n<p data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b633-5\">The rights then, if any, of which the relator has been deprived, are mere private rights, for which <em>mandamus </em>will not lie by the Code of Georgia: Code, secs 3143 and 5. But, allowing that the relator had rights, he was properly expelled under the by-laws, Article IX. \"We say that this is a good by-law, and one which the society had a right to pass: 7 T. R., 278. The power of expulsion and disfranchisement is incident to a corporation of this character, where no pecuniary interests are involved: 2 Kent Com., 297, 1 Burrows, 589 ; Crabbe on Real Prop., 387.</p>\n<p data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b633-6\">\u2022 The party received full notice under the by-law, with an opportunity to defend, but contented himself with protesting against the action of the society. The offence with which he was charged, was committed in the face of the society, and he was properly expelled. But, if the validity of the bylaw is doubtful, it does not lie in the mouth of the relator to say so. He joined the society under the by-law: 5 Burrows, 2761. If this be so, it answers the counsel\u2019s argument with reference to the deprivation of property. The relator only took any property or franchise <em>sub modo. </em>He could hold it so long as he did not violate the constitution and bylaws of the society ; he consented to forfeit it if he did violate Article IX of the by-laws. Even if the proceedings have not been conducted with perfect regularity, still, if good cause for disfranchisement be shewn, the <em>mandamus </em>will not be granted: 2 Term, 177; 2 Cowper, p. 523.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b633-7\">Brown, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">1. It was insisted, in this ease, that the Georgia Medical Society was in existence long before it was incorporated, and that its objects were in no way changed by its application for and acceptance of its present charter from the State. This may be very true, but its legal responsibilities were changed by the acceptance of the charter. While it remained a vol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>untary society, the courts had no jurisdiction over it, if it violated no law of the State, and its members had no property in their membership which the law could protect.- But its acceptance of the charter subjected it to the supervision of the proper legal authorities having jurisdiction in such cases: 4 Wheat., 674-5; 6 Conn., 544-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">2. When the voluntary society accepted the charter, it became a private, civil corporation, and the corporators, then in being, acquired a property in the franchise, and every person who has since become a corporator has acquired a like property. The property which the corporator acquires is not visible, tangible property; but it is none the less property, because it is invisible and intangible. It is not -a corporeal hereditament; but it is incorporeal. Blackstone, in his Commentaries, volume 2, page 21, says: That incorporeal hereditaments are divided into ten sorts; one of these consists of <em>franchises. </em>Bouvier, in his Law Dictionary, volume 1, page 593, says the word franchise has several meanings, one of which he gives as follows: <em>\u201c </em>It is a certain privilege conferred by grant from the government and vested in individuals. Corporations or bodies politic are the most usual franchise known to our law.\u201d The law books are full of the doctrine that persons may have a property in incorporeal hereditaments, franchises, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">Property, says Bouvier, volume 2, page 381, is divided into corporeal and incorporeal. The former comprehends such property as is perceptible to the senses, as lands, houses, goods, merchandize and the like; <em>the latter </em>consists in <em>legal rights </em>as dioses in action, easements and <em>the like, </em>Blackstone says, volume 2, page 37, it is likewise a franchise for a number of persons to be incorporated and subsist as a body politic, with power to maintain perpetual succession, and to do other corporate acts, and each <em>individual member </em>of such corporation is also said to have a franchise or freedom. We think it well settled by these and other authorities, that a corporator in a private, civil corporation, has a property in the franchise, of which he can not be deprived without due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>3. It was insisted by the learned counsel for the plaintiff in error, that the ninth by-law of this corporation, is unauthorized by the charter, and that the corporation is not justifiable in-expelling a member for its violation, that to deprive a corporator of his property in the franchise under it, is to deprive him of his property without due process of law. We think the ninth by-law a proper one in view of the objects of the society, and we hold that the charter conferred upon the corporation the power to ordain and establish it, and that they have the power to expel a member when a proper case arises under it.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">But we hold that the society has not an uncontrollable- discretion in its construction and enforcement. They cannot, under pretext of enforcing this rule, take personal or private revenge, or make it the instrument of religious intolerance, or political proscription. When a member feels that he is aggrieved or injured by the illegal or oppressive action of the body, it is his right to appeal to the Courts for redress and protection; and it is the right and duty of the Court to investigate such charges, when properly before it, and to judge of the legality of the action of the society in expelling a member or depriving him of any other legal right.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">4. The rule of law on this subject is thus-stated by Judge Blackstone, volume 1, page 381. The king being thus constited by law, visitor of <em>all civil </em>corporations, the law has also appointed the place where he shall exercise this jurisdiction, which is the Court of King\u2019s Bench, where, and where only, all misbehaviors of this kind of corporations, are inquired into and redressed, and all their controversies decided. In this State the same visitorial power of correcting the misbehaviors of these corporations, and deciding their controversies, is vested in the Superior Courts of the counties where they are located, which, in England, belongs to the King\u2019s Bench. See 5 John. Ch. R., 335.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">It was contended, with much zeal and ability, by the able counsel for the defendant in error, that <em>mandamus </em>is not the proper remedy, even if we admit that the rights of Dr. Waring have been infringed, or that he has been deprived of them <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>by the illegal action of the society. The rule, as laid down by this Court in a number of cases, is that a person having a clear legal right under the laws of this State, is entitled to the writ of <em>mandamus, </em>if he has no other remedy to enforce it: 4 <em>Ga., </em>26 and <em>116; </em>12 <em>Ga., 170; </em>26 <em>Ga., </em>665.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">But it is insisted that the Code, section 3143, has changed this rule, and that <em>mandamus </em>does not now lie as a private remedy between individuals to enforce private rights. We do not think this section of the Code was intended to deny the writ to the corporator, who is deprived of this rights by the corporation, when he has no other adequate remedy, for their enforcement. A corporation having been created, invested with certain powers, and charged with certain duties to be performed for the benefit of the public, is not a private <em>individual, </em>in the sense of the word as used in said section of the Code, and a corporator whose rights are withheld or violated by the corporation, who is without other remedy, is entitled to the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">In the Commonwealth <em>ex rel., </em>etc., vs. The Mayor of Lancaster, 5 Watts, 152, Gibson, C. J., says: \u201cAn <em>action </em>to enforce the right could not be maintained against the corporation because performance of a <em>corporate function </em>is not a duty to be demanded by action; and unless recourse could be had to the <em>functionary </em>in the first instance, the relator might have a cause for redress without a remedy.\u201d See 4 <em>Ga., </em>44.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">Here the discharge of a corporate duty' is treated as an office or function, and the corporation as a functionary. In this sense, no doubt, the legislature, in the adoption of the Code, intended to treat them.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-8\">The object of this society, as cited in their charter, was \u201c for the purpose of lessening the fatality induced by climate and incidental causes, and improving the science of medicine.\u201d The whole community have an interest in the success of this laudable undertaking; and if the functions conferred by the charter, for the benefit of the public, are not faithfully performed, and one of the corporators, who has no other adequate redress, is injured by the conduct of the corporation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>(the functionary,) the Courts will grant him relief by <em>mandamus.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">6. The record in this case shows no sufficient cause to justify the society in expelling Dr. Waring from his rights and privileges as a corporator. He was expelled for doing that which the law of this State not only authorizes but encourages. His offending consists in the fact that he became one of the sureties on the official bond of a colored citizen of his county, who had been elected Clerk of the Superior Court of the county, by a majority of the legal votes cast at the election for that office, and in the further fact that he became surety on the bonds of certain other colored citizens who were charged with the offence of riot, for their appearance at Court to answer the charge as the law directs. The very fact that the law requires the Clerk of the Superior Court to give bond and security- for the faithful discharge of his duties, is sufficient to justify any citizen of the county in becoming one of his sureties, and to protect him in contemplation of law, from the imputation of having forfeited his position as a gentleman by so doing.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">Again, it is not the object of law to punish citizens of this State, whether white or black, by imprisonment, for offences of which they have never been convicted. When they are charged with violations of the Penal Code, the requirement of the law is, that they appear at the proper time and place, and answer the charge; and to secure such appearance, they are required to give bond and security, and it is only on failure to give the bond, that they can be imprisoned. As innocent persons are often confined in prison under charges, because of their inability to give bond, the law favors bail whenever the offense is, by law, bailable. And the law favors this even in the case of the guilty, till the trial. This is not only best for the public, as it saves the tax-payers the expense of keeping them in jail, but it is just to the accused, who receive the legal punishment for their crimes, if guilty, under the sentence of the Court after legal conviction. How then does a citizen forfeit his corporate rights as a member of a civil corporation, or his position as a gentleman, by doing an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>act that is not only encouraged, by the laws of his State, but is a positive public benefit ?</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">But it is said Dr. Waring was not expelled for becoming surety on the bonds above mentioned, but for ungentlemanly conduct in the presence of the society. \u25a0 What ungentlemanly conduct ? The ninth by-law requires that \u201cspecific charges <em>\u201d </em>be set forth and handed to the accused at least one month before the society takes action thereon. What specific charges of ungentlemanly conduct in presence of the society, were ever handed to Dr. Waring?' What did he say or do in presence of the society, to forfeit his position as a gentleman? The record is silent. That silence is significant. That which is material and is not averred by the society in their answer is presumed not to exist. Ho ungentlemanly conduct in presence of the society is set forth in their response, and this Court must presume none existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">Dr. Waring was convicted of the charges first mentioned, in reference to the suretyship, and brought formally before the society, and censured. To this illegal and unauthorized proceeding he submitted. But, not satisfied with this, at the next meeting of the society, he was again brought up, and his resignation demanded, and he was given till the succeeding meeting to comply with the imperious and unauthorized demand.- This he declined to do. And a preamble and resolutions were then passed, setting a future day when the society would vote on his expulsion for refusing to resign, and for discourteous behavior towards the society at two former meetings. In what the discourteous behavior consisted we are not informed by the record. In the meantime, however, the gracious privilege of avoiding expulsion by resignation was still held out to Dr. Waring. When the time came for the much cherished object, by the infliction of the extreme penalty of expulsion, Dr. Waring was at home, sick, and unable to attend'; but he wrote the society, disclaiming all intentional discourtesy to it or its members; and protested against the irregularity and illegality of the course resolved upon, as set forth in said preamble and resolutions. But all to no effect. His expulsion was pre-determined, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>that determination was executed. A more illegal or unjustifiable proceeding lias seldom been brought before a Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">After argument had, and a thorough examination of this case, it is the unanimous judgment of this Court, that the judgment of the Court below be reversed, and the Judge of the Superior Courts of said county is hereby instructed and ordered to grant a peremptory <em>mandamus, </em>commanding and compelling the said \u201cThe Georgia Medical Society\u201d to restore the said Dr. James J. Waring to all his rights and privileges as a corporator in said society.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
