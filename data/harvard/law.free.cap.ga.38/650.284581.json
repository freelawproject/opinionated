The qustion is <em>res </em>adju\u2022 <em>dicata.</em></headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b658-10\">Motion for new trial. Decided by Judge Clark.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">We see no cause for complaint at the decision of this case, in 37 <em>Ga. R., </em>48. That ruling is sustained by <em>Mitchell vs. Printup, </em>25 <em>Ga. R., </em>182, and by <em>Beard vs. Simmons, </em>9 <em>Ga. R., </em>4. The other application for new trial, in this case, was made upon the identical ground set forth in this application, and was overruled by this Court. A party can not avoid the effect of a solemn adjudication of his rights in a Court of competent jurisdiction, by a change <em>of forum, </em>from the equity to the law side of the Court. The maxim \u201c <em>res judicatae pro veritate accipiuntur,\u201d </em>is applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
