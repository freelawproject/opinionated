Although we question the Superior Court's interpretation, in its September 28, 2015 decision reversing and remanding the decision of the Merit Employee Relations Board, of 29\n   <em>\n    Del. C.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 10122 to require twenty-days advance notice of a change in the start time of a previously noticed hearing due to weather conditions, we conclude that the cross-appeal is moot in light of our affirmance of the Superior Court's September 29, 2017 decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   NOW, THEREFORE, IT IS ORDERED that the judgment of the Superior Court is AFFIRMED.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
