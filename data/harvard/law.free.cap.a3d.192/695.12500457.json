Recent Supreme Court Decisions Applicable to Juvenile Offenders\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   During the past 15 years, the Supreme Court has issued a series of decisions in which it held that the Eighth Amendment to the federal Constitution places limits on the sentencing of juvenile offenders that do not apply to the sentencing of adult offenders. In particular, the Court has held that the Eighth Amendment bars imposition of the death penalty and severely restricts the imposition of a sentence of life without parole.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    Juvenile offenders may not be sentenced to the death penalty\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Roper v. Simmons\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In 2005, the Supreme Court held that the Eighth Amendment's proscription against \"cruel and unusual punishments\" prohibits the imposition of the death penalty\n   against a defendant who committed the offense as a juvenile -\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , when the defendant was less than 18 years old.\n   <em>\n    Roper v.

The Court found the basis for this consensus in well accepted differences between juveniles and adults. It stated that the death penalty is reserved for the worst offenders, and that several characteristics of juveniles make it difficult to reliably say whether a juvenile offender belongs in that category.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The Court identified the following characteristics of juveniles: (1) juveniles lack maturity, leading to \"an underdeveloped sense of responsibility,\" as well as \"impetuous and ill-considered actions and decisions\"; (2) juveniles are more vulnerable or susceptible to negative influences and peer pressure due, in part, to juveniles having less control over their environment or freedom \"to extricate themselves from a criminogenic setting\"; (3) the personality of a juvenile is not as well formed as that of an adult, and their traits are more transitory and less fixed.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5928574\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/551/\">\n    543 U.S. at 569-70\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5928574\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/551/\">\n    125 S.Ct. 1183\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotations and citations omitted). In light of these characteristics, the usual sentencing justifications for the death penalty - retribution and deterrence - did not provide adequate justification for imposing the death penalty against juvenile offenders.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5928574\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/551/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5928574\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/551/\">\n    at 571-72\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5928574\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/551/\">\n    125 S.Ct. 1183\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Court concluded that the differences between juveniles and adults \"are too marked and well understood to risk allowing a youthful person to receive the death penalty despite insufficient culpability.\" The confluence of these factors led the Supreme Court to adopt a categorical prohibition against the imposition of the death penalty against juvenile offenders.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5928574\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/551/\">\n    543 U.S. at 572-73\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5928574\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/551/\">\n    125 S.Ct. 1183\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    Juvenile non-homicide offenders may not be sentenced to life without parole\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Graham v.

In contrast to its decision in\n   <em>\n    Roper\n   </em>\n   , the Court did not conclude that this punishment was unconstitutional for all juvenile offenders. Rather, the Court drew a distinction between juveniles convicted of homicide and those who had been convicted of other offenses, and held that a sentence of life without parole violates the Eighth Amendment when imposed on a juvenile offender who did not commit homicide.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12448995,3641893\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/560/48/\">\n    560 U.S. at 82\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12448995,3641893\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/560/48/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 2011\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The Court first considered whether there were \"indicia of a national consensus\" on the subject. After reviewing various statistics on state laws concerning juvenile sentencing and actual practice, the Court concluded that \"life without parole sentences for juveniles convicted of nonhomicide crimes is as rare as other sentencing practices found to be cruel and unusual.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12448995,3641893\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/560/48/\">\n    560 U.S. at 66\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12448995,3641893\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/560/48/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 2011\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court then considered whether the challenged practice serves legitimate penological goals. The Court reiterated its analysis in\n   <em>\n    Roper\n   </em>\n   that juveniles have \"lessened culpability\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   in comparison to adults. It also distinguished between homicide and non-homicide offenders, recognizing that \"defendants who do not kill, intend to kill, or foresee that life will be taken are categorically less deserving of the most serious form of punishment than are murderers.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12448995,3641893\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/560/48/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12448995,3641893\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/560/48/\">\n    at 69\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12448995,3641893\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/560/48/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 2011\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Court considered the common purposes of sentencing schemes: retribution, deterrence, incapacitation, and rehabilitation. Retribution was insufficient because \"the heart of the retribution rationale is that a criminal sentence must be directly related to the personal culpability of the criminal offender[,]\" and that \"the case for retribution is not as strong with a minor as with an adult.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12448995,3641893\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/560/48/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). Deterrence could not justify the sentence because the characteristics that make juveniles more likely to make bad decisions also make them less likely to consider the possibility of punishment, which is a prerequisite to a deterrent effect.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12448995,3641893\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/560/48/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12448995,3641893\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/560/48/\">\n    at 72\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12448995,3641893\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/560/48/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 2011\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Incapacitation could not support the sentence because of the difficulty in determining whether a juvenile defendant is incorrigible at the time of sentencing -\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   \"to differentiate between the juvenile offender whose crime reflects unfortunate yet transient immaturity, and the rare juvenile offender whose crime reflects irreparable corruption.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12448995,3641893\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/560/48/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12448995,3641893\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/560/48/\">\n    at 72-73\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12448995,3641893\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/560/48/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 2011\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Roper\n   </em>\n   ).

The General Assembly has exercised that constitutional authority by creating the Maryland Parole Commission and enacting statutes governing the process by which an inmate can seek release on parole.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Maryland Code, Correctional Services Article (\"CS\"), \u00a7 7-101\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   Pursuant to legislative direction, the Parole Commission has adopted regulations governing its policies and activities with respect to parole.

CS \u00a7 7-301(a) ; COMAR 12.08.01.17A. There are a number of exceptions to that general rule, two of which are pertinent to this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   First, if the inmate was convicted of a violent crime committed after October 1, 1994, the inmate is not eligible for parole consideration until the inmate has served one-half of the aggregate sentence for the violent crimes,\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   or one-fourth of the aggregate sentence, whichever is greater. CS \u00a7 7-301(c)(1)(i) ; COMAR 12.08.01.17A(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Second, an inmate sentenced to life imprisonment with the possibility of parole is not eligible for parole consideration until the inmate has served 15 years (or the equivalent of 15 years taking into account diminution credits). CS \u00a7 7-301(d)(1) ; COMAR 12.08.01.17A(7). In certain cases in which the inmate was convicted of first-degree murder, the inmate may not be eligible for parole until the inmate has served 25 years (taking into account diminution credits).

Hearings may be conducted by a hearing examiner employed by the Parole Commission or by a Commissioner, except that only Commissioners may conduct hearings\n   in certain enumerated cases.

In a feature that distinguishes the parole system in Maryland from that in most other states,\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Governor plays a role in cases where the inmate is serving a life sentence.

CS \u00a7 7-301(d)(5)(i) ; COMAR 12.08.01.17A(7)(g). The Governor may approve or disapprove the Parole Commission's recommendation, but if the Governor does not do either within 180 days of receipt of the recommendation and the inmate has already served 25 years, the Parole Commission's recommendation becomes the effective decision on parole.

In 1995, in the course of denying parole to several inmates serving life sentences, Governor Parris Glendening declared that he would not approve the parole of any prisoner serving a life sentence unless the inmate was very old or terminally ill. (Under the statute at that time, the Governor's affirmative approval was an absolute prerequisite for parole of an inmate serving a life sentence; gubernatorial inaction could not result in parole). As a result, the Division of Correction and the Parole Commission halted their consideration of parole recommendations for inmates serving life sentences. The Governor's announcement sparked constitutional challenges to the policy and to the Maryland parole system.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Several inmates challenged the Glendening policy as a violation of the\n   <em>\n    ex post facto\n   </em>\n   clause of the State and federal Constitutions - in particular, they contended that the Governor's\n   policy had converted a life sentence with the possibility of parole to a life sentence without parole.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lomax v.

Recent legal developments have suggested that parole of inmates serving life sentences will no longer be blocked by such a policy. In 2011, the Legislature amended the statute to provide that gubernatorial inaction in the face of a favorable parole recommendation would not block release of certain inmates serving life sentences.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   footnote 13, above.

These cases present three permutations: (1) a homicide case in which the defendant received a sentence of life imprisonment; (2) a non-homicide case in which the defendant received a sentence of life imprisonment; and (3) a non-homicide case involving multiple offenses in which the defendant received an aggregate sentence of 100 years imprisonment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   1.

Those offenses all related to the fatal shooting of another man. On September 16, 1999, a jury in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City found Mr. Carter guilty of first-degree murder, use of a handgun in a crime of violence, and possession of a handgun.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   He was sentenced on November 9, 1999. The State recommended a life sentence with all but 50 years suspended for the murder, and 20 years for the handgun use charge. (The State indicated that it did not object to running the sentence for the handgun charge concurrently with the sentence for the murder charge.) Mr. Carter's counsel asked that the court suspend a significant portion of the sentence, citing his youth, unstable home life, and limited capacity for understanding. In allocution, Mr. Carter denied committing the murder. The Circuit Court stated that it was \"not satisfied that [Mr. Carter] would be anything other than a detriment and a danger to other people on the street[,]\" and sentenced Mr. Carter to a life sentence for the murder with a consecutive 20 year term for the handgun charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   We understand that Mr. Carter will become eligible for parole after serving 25 years (with allowance for diminution credits), as a result of his consecutive sentences for homicide (eligible after serving 15 years) and for the handgun charge, a violent crime (eligible after serving one-half the sentence - that is, 10 years). CS \u00a7 7-301(d)(1) ; CS \u00a7 7-301(c)(1)(ii). We were advised by his counsel at oral argument that it is anticipated that he will have a parole hearing sometime later this year or next year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   On September 28, 2015, Mr. Carter filed a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   motion under Maryland Rule 4-345 to correct an illegal sentence. The motion relied primarily on\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   , arguing that the sentencing judge should have considered Mr. Carter's youth, intellectual and psychological disabilities, and social background. In addition, Mr. Carter highlighted several accomplishments during his incarceration, which he said demonstrated that he was amenable to rehabilitation. The Circuit Court denied Mr. Carter's motion. In its written order, the court noted that, unlike the situation in\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   , Mr. Carter had not been sentenced to life without parole and therefore will eventually be eligible for parole consideration - a decision it felt was \"properly left to the executive branch.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Mr. Carter sought review in the Court of Special Appeals. Mr. Carter argued that, in light of Governor Glendening's stated policy,\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   his sentence was functionally one of life without the possibility of parole. In an unreported opinion dated August 11, 2017, the Court of Special Appeals rejected that argument and dismissed the appeal as premature. The intermediate appellate court reasoned that Mr. Carter was not yet eligible for parole, that the Parole Commission had not yet made a recommendation to the Governor, that the Governor had not yet disapproved such a recommendation, and accordingly, that Mr. Carter had suffered no legally cognizable harm under the recent Eighth Amendment case law. The court also held that Mr. Carter lacked standing to argue that Maryland's parole system is unconstitutional as applied to all juvenile offenders serving life sentences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Mr. Carter petitioned this Court for a writ of\n   <em>\n    certiorari\n   </em>\n   , which we granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   2. James Bowie\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   <em>\n    Convicted of non-homicide offenses and sentenced to life with eligibility for parole\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   James Bowie was 17 years and 11 months old when he committed the offenses for which he is currently imprisoned. In February 1996, a grand jury in the Circuit Court for Charles County charged him with attempted first-degree murder, attempted second-degree murder, robbery with a deadly weapon, and related counts all arising from the same incident. Pursuant to an agreement with the State, on October 7, 1996, he pled not guilty, waived trial by jury, and submitted to a bench trial based on a stipulation of facts which included an understanding that the judge could consider evidence that had been introduced at the trial of his co-defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   The evidence demonstrated that, on December 28, 1995, Mr. Bowie and two friends, after a day of drinking alcohol and smoking crack cocaine, went to the home of a 67-year old\n   waterman at the suggestion of one of the friends. Mr. Bowie and the friend who had selected the victim entered the house to rob the waterman. The friend sprayed the victim with mace and Mr. Bowie repeatedly hit the waterman in the head with a baseball bat, fracturing the man's skull. The man survived. Mr. Bowie and his friend stole $500 in cash, which they used to buy more cocaine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   At the trial on October 7, 1996, the court found Mr. Bowie guilty of attempted first-degree murder, attempted second-degree murder, and robbery with a deadly weapon. Sentencing took place on January 21, 1997. At the sentencing,\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   the State emphasized the severity of the crime and how close the victim had come to dying. Defense counsel outlined Mr. Bowie's family history, which was marked by his parents' substance abuse, divorce, and abandonment of Mr. Bowie. Counsel also described Mr. Bowie's own resort to substance abuse at a young age, and attributed Mr. Bowie's poor judgment in part to his young age. Defense counsel emphasized Mr. Bowie's remorse and candor with police. He indicated that the sentencing guidelines at that time would suggest a sentence between three years and three months and 13 years, depending on aggravating circumstances, and asked that it be served at the Patuxent Institution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   The court sentenced Mr. Bowie to life in prison on the attempted murder count and a concurrent 20-year sentence on the robbery count. In reaching that decision, the judge stated that rehabilitation was either not an issue in this case or, at best, an incidental consideration because Mr. Bowie was \"somebody who is capable of this kind of engineering and participating actively in this kind of horror.\" The court viewed the primary aims of a sentence in Mr. Bowie's case as \"segregating people of this sort, who are capable of this kind\n   of behavior ... where they can't harm the rest of us[,]\" with retribution \"[c]lose on [its] heels[.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   On direct appeal, the Court of Special Appeals affirmed the conviction in an unreported opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   Mr. Bowie became eligible for parole after serving 15 years of his sentence (or its equivalent taking into account diminution credits). CS \u00a7 7-301(d)(1). We understand that he became eligible by at least January 2011, even if he had no diminution credits. We were advised at oral argument that Mr. Bowie had a parole hearing approximately 12 years into his sentence, that the Parole Commission did not make a recommendation at that time, and that his case was \"set off\" for future consideration by the Parole Commission.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   It is expected that he will have another hearing in the not too distant future.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   In March 2016, Mr. Bowie filed a motion under Maryland Rule 4-345 to correct an illegal sentence. In support of that motion, he attached information that he had obtained from the Parole Commission that, during the previous 20 years, the Parole Commission had recommended parole for 27 inmates serving life sentences, that governors had denied 24 of those recommendations, and that three remained pending. In his motion, Mr. Bowie argued that those statistics established that the Maryland parole system with respect to juvenile offenders serving life sentences was in fact an executive clemency system that was unconstitutional under\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   . He asserted that the Maryland parole scheme does not afford an offender a meaningful opportunity to obtain release based on demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation and \"therefore converts a 'life' sentence into - for constitutional purposes - a 'life without parole' sentence.\" The Circuit Court denied the motion without holding a hearing. In its order, the Circuit Court cited\n   <em>\n    Kanaras\n   </em>\n   and stated that \"the acts of the Parole Commission and the Commissioner of Correction, which may\n   have the effect of denying certain inmates parole consideration\" do not render a sentence illegal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Mr. Bowie appealed. In an unreported opinion dated August 11, 2017, the Court of Special Appeals affirmed the Circuit Court for the same reasons that it had dismissed Mr. Carter's appeal\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   -\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   Mr. Bowie's claims were premature because the Commission had not yet recommended him for parole to the Governor, and there was no indication that the Parole Commission would not apply the factors related to juvenile offenders in its regulations, so his alleged injury was conjectural or hypothetical and he lacked standing to challenge the constitutionality of Maryland's parole system.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   Mr. Bowie petitioned this Court for a writ of\n   <em>\n    certiorari\n   </em>\n   , which we granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   3. Matthew McCullough\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   <em>\n    Convicted of non-homicide offenses and sentenced to aggregate 100-year sentence\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Matthew McCullough was 17 years old when he committed the offenses for which he is currently imprisoned. In May 2004, a grand jury in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County charged him with various offenses arising from a non-fatal shooting incident at his high school in which several students were injured. The case was tried before a jury in November 2004. The jury found Mr. McCullough guilty of four counts of first-degree assault, although it acquitted him of attempted murder and related counts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   According to the evidence at trial, Mr. McCullough, a transfer student at the school, had had a dispute with another student and was required to stay away from the school for a \"cool down\" period of several days. However, on the day of the incident, Mr. McCullough returned to the school several times with different friends. On the final occasion, during a charity basketball game at the school, one of the friends brought a\n   gun, shots were fired (some by Mr. McCullough), and four students were injured. One of the injured students was paralyzed and confined to a wheelchair as a result of the incident. The evidence was not definitive on who fired the shots that resulted in the injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   At the sentencing in January 2005, the prosecution argued for a sentence \"substantially in excess\" of the 50 years incarceration previously imposed on Mr. McCullough's adult co-defendant who had pled guilty under a plea agreement that included a binding term concerning the sentence. The State pointed to Mr. McCullough's role in precipitating the incident, as well as his apparent lack of remorse or willingness to take responsibility for his actions. On Mr. McCullough's behalf, defense counsel asserted that, prior to the death of Mr. McCullough's father in 2003, which resulted in his transfer to the school, Mr. McCullough had been a courteous and respectful member of his community. Witnesses who testified on his behalf at the sentencing said that he was a candidate for rehabilitation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   The Circuit Court acknowledged that the sentencing guidelines suggested a sentence between five and 10 years for each of the four counts, but stated that the guidelines did not capture how \"vicious and heinous\" the particular crime was and imposed the maximum period of incarceration - 25 years - for each assault count to run consecutively. Thus, Mr. McCullough's aggregate sentence was 100 years incarceration. Mr. McCullough appealed and argued, among other things, that the aggregate sentence violated the constitutional proscription against cruel and unusual punishment. The Court of Special Appeals affirmed the convictions and sentence in an unreported opinion dated November 28, 2005 - a decision that pre-dated the Supreme Court's decisions in\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   Under current Maryland law, Mr. McCullough will become eligible for parole consideration after serving 50 years of his aggregate sentence - a date decades in the future.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   In 2007, Mr. McCullough filed a petition for postconviction review alleging ineffective assistance of counsel, which was denied. The Court of Special Appeals denied his application\n   for leave to appeal that decision. Mr. McCullough raised similar claims in a\n   <em>\n    habeas corpus\n   </em>\n   proceeding in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, which denied that petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   In March 2016, Mr. McCullough filed a motion under Maryland Rule 4-345 to correct an illegal sentence, citing\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   and the other Eighth Amendment decisions concerning the sentencing of juvenile\n   offenders to life without parole. He argued that his 100-year aggregate sentence provided no meaningful opportunity for release, in violation of the constitutional prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. The Circuit Court denied that motion without a hearing. Mr. McCullough appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   In an opinion dated August 30, 2017, the Court of Special Appeals affirmed that decision.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12314323,12490742\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/233/702/\">\n    233 Md.

In the alternative, the court held that, even if\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   does apply to those circumstances, Mr. McCullough will be eligible for parole after serving 50 years, a period that the court believed was within his natural life expectancy and therefore shorter than a life sentence.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12314323,12490742\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/233/702/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12314323,12490742\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/233/702/\">\n    at 744-45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12314323,12490742\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/233/702/\">\n    168 A.3d 1045\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

None of the three Petitioners was formally sentenced to life without parole. In each case, the Petitioner is pursuing a motion under Maryland Rule 4-345 to correct an illegal sentence, where the motion is based in large part on an argument that the law and practice governing the Maryland parole system has converted the Petitioner's sentence into one that is effectively life without parole. Because there are significant differences in the issues as they relate to an inmate who is serving a formal life sentence - like Mr. Carter and Mr. Bowie - and one who is serving a term of years - like Mr. McCullough - we discuss them separately.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     A.

Whether the Motions to Correct an Illegal Sentence can be Decided\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   The State argues that the appeals of Mr. Carter and Mr. Bowie are premature. The Court of Special Appeals agreed on the grounds that Mr. Carter and Mr. Bowie lacked standing, that their claims were not ripe, and that the canon of constitutional avoidance counseled against resolving those claims at this time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   <em>\n    Standing\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   With respect to the concept of standing, both Mr. Carter and Mr. Bowie are currently serving life sentences. There is no question that they have standing\n   to file a motion to correct an illegal sentence\n   under Maryland Rule 4-345.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jones v.

Under those cases, a life sentence imposed on a juvenile offender must provide \"a meaningful opportunity for release\" in the future based on the offender's rehabilitation - unless the offender was convicted of homicide and determined to be incorrigible in an individualized sentencing proceeding. If the laws and regulations governing the Maryland parole system with respect to a juvenile offender serving a life sentence do not provide that opportunity, a sentence of life imprisonment fails under the Eighth Amendment prohibition against cruel and unusual punishments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   The answer to the question as to whether the Maryland parole system provides a meaningful opportunity for release does not turn on the outcome of a particular parole hearing. The parole system may be fully compliant with the Eighth Amendment and deny release to an inmate like Mr. Carter or Mr. Bowie. As the Supreme Court stated in\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   , the Eighth Amendment does not require a \"guarantee [of] eventual freedom.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12448995,3641893\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/560/48/\">\n    560 U.S. at 75\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12448995,3641893\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/560/48/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 2011\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . On the other hand, a parole system that fails to comply with Eighth Amendment standards and that is an executive clemency system in disguise may nevertheless result in the release of a juvenile offender serving a life sentence. Such a result may render a claim under\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   moot, but it would not determine the merits of the claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   Thus, the outcome of a parole hearing does not necessarily indicate whether the parole system complies with the Eighth Amendment. To the extent that the claims of Mr. Carter and Mr. Bowie are based on the structure of the parole system in Maryland (as opposed to its operation in practice), adjudication of their claims that their sentences are illegal need not await the outcome of their parole hearings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   <em>\n    Canon of Constitutional Avoidance\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   With respect to the canon of constitutional avoidance, it is true that \"[t]his Court has emphasized, time after time, that the Court's strong and established policy is to decide constitutional issues only when necessary.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   <em>\n    VNA Hospice of Md. v.

However, that canon relates to\n   <em>\n    how\n   </em>\n   a court decides a case, not\n   <em>\n    whether\n   </em>\n   it decides the case. We will not decide constitutional questions in these cases if we can resolve these appeals without doing so. But we cannot resort to that rationale to avoid deciding these cases at all.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   2. What Claims are Cognizable on a Motion to Correct an Illegal Sentence\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   There remains the question whether the contentions of Mr. Carter and Mr. Bowie are cognizable in a proceeding\n   on a motion to correct an illegal sentence under Maryland Rule 4-345. \"A motion to correct an illegal sentence ordinarily can be granted only where there is some illegality in the sentence itself or where no sentence should have been imposed.\"\n   <em>\n    Evans v.

There is a distinction \"between errors that inhere in the sentence itself, and other errors that may affect a sentence but do not fall under the purview of Rule 4-345(a).\"\n   <em>\n    Barnes v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3703430\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/423/75/#p85\">\n    423 Md. 75\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 85,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3703430\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/423/75/#p85\">\n    31 A.3d 203\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2011).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Kanaras,\n   </em>\n   the Court distinguished between sentences that are \"inherently\" illegal and those that are carried out in some illegal fashion. How the Parole Commission and the Governor are supposed to discharge their duties under Maryland law is inherent in the sentence, but what they do in practice is not. As the Court stated in\n   <em>\n    Kanaras\n   </em>\n   , other causes of action are more appropriate to litigate claims that the Parole Commission and others involved in the parole system are not carrying out their responsibilities.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Kanaras\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11479347\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/357/170/\">\n    357 Md. at 185\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11479064,11479347,11479236\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/742/508/\">\n    742 A.2d 508\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . To the extent that Mr. Carter and Mr. Bowie are challenging the actual practice of the Parole Commission and the Governor in making parole decisions,\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   their claims are outside the scope of a motion to correct an illegal sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   We thus agree with the Court of Special Appeals that whether the Parole Commission and others involved in the parole system are carrying out their duties in practice is not at issue in this appeal.

And, under\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Solem\n   </em>\n   , an executive clemency system cannot rescue a sentence that is otherwise excessive for purposes of the Eighth Amendment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   We would certainly reach that conclusion if the Glendening policy remained in effect. At the time Governor Glendening\n   announced his policy, it was consistent with the contemporary understanding of the Constitution and of the Governor's statutory powers, as this Court held in\n   <em>\n    Lomax\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Kanaras\n   </em>\n   . If a Governor were to adopt that same policy today, it would be in defiance of the Constitution, at least as applied to juvenile offenders. Such a policy, lawful as it may have been (and may still be) as to adult offenders, is now clearly unconstitutional as to a juvenile non-homicide offender (and most juvenile homicide offenders), as it offers no meaningful opportunity to obtain release based on demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation, but only on the basis of age and terminal illness. Subsequent to\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   , we could not ignore similar statements of a Maryland chief executive, who takes an oath under the Maryland Constitution to \"support the Constitution\" of the United States, as well as the \"Constitution and Laws\" of Maryland. Maryland Constitution, Article I, \u00a7 9 ; Maryland Code, General Provisions Article, \u00a7 2-202.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   Even in the absence of a policy that was unconstitutional on its face with respect to juvenile offenders, the unfettered discretion of the Governor under CS \u00a7 7-301(d) to decide whether or not to grant parole for juvenile offenders serving life sentences would be problematic by itself, as the Governor potentially could disapprove a parole recommendation without reference to any criteria related to the demonstrated maturity or rehabilitation of the inmate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   <em>\n    Remedies\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   If the structure of the Maryland parole system does render the sentences of Mr. Carter and Mr. Bowie effectively life without parole, then those sentences violate the Eighth Amendment and would therefore be illegal. Mr. Bowie would be entitled to a new sentence compliant with\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   . Mr. Carter would be entitled to a new sentencing proceeding at which the court would consider whether he was one of the few juvenile homicide offenders who\n   is incorrigible and may therefore be sentenced constitutionally to life without parole. Otherwise, he would be entitled to be re-sentenced like Mr. Bowie.\n   Courts in other states have had to grapple with how to ensure the legality of existing and future sentences of juvenile offenders under the laws of their respective states in the wake of\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   while not intruding on the legislature's role in defining offenses and punishments.\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   Some courts, expressing discomfort, have assumed the role of temporary legislator in directing trial courts how to comply with the Eighth Amendment with respect to post conviction reviews and future sentencing.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stevens v.

It seems a matter of common sense that the answer must be \"yes.\" Otherwise, the Eighth Amendment\n   proscription against cruel and unusual punishment in the context of a juvenile offender could be circumvented simply by stating the sentence in numerical terms that exceed any reasonable life expectancy rather than labeling it a \"life\" sentence. The vast majority of state supreme courts to consider this question agree that a sentence stated as a term of years, or as a life sentence with parole after a specified number of years, can fall within the scope of\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   as a\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   sentence of life without parole.\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n   This conclusion is supported not simply by common sense or by a straw\n   poll of other courts.

Neither type of sentence contemplates the defendant returning to society, either as a reformed citizen or as a potential threat. Because no penological theory justifies treating a\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   life without parole sentence differently than an actual life without parole sentence for a juvenile offender, we hold that a lengthy term-of-years sentence can be a life sentence for purposes of the Eighth Amendment.

At one end of the spectrum, an individual may embark on a serious crime spree, involving, for example, a series of armed\n   robberies or sexual assaults over weeks or months or even years. Whether the crimes are prosecuted together or separately, the courts may sentence the individual to significant periods of incarceration for each incident. These circumstances are least likely to warrant the aggregate sentence being treated as a\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   life sentence.

As the Supreme Court of Ohio stated: \"Whether the sentence is the product of a discrete offense or multiple offenses, the fact remains that it was a\n   <em>\n    juvenile\n   </em>\n   who committed the one offense or several offenses and who has diminished moral culpability.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Rather, consideration must be given to where the stacked sentence falls on the spectrum as well as to the differences between adult and juvenile offenders. That is what we shall do in analyzing Mr. McCullough's case.\n   4. Application to Mr. McCullough's Case\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-208\">\n   Mr. McCullough was sentenced to a total of 100 years incarceration and will not be eligible for parole until he has served 50 years of that sentence. If it were a sentence for a single conviction, it would be treated as a sentence of life without parole for purposes of Eighth Amendment analysis under most of the benchmarks applied by the courts. The parole eligibility date far exceeds the parole eligibility date for a defendant sentenced to life in prison under Maryland law (15 years); it exceeds the threshold duration recognized by most courts in decisions and legislatures in reform legislation (significantly less than 50 years); and the eligibility date will be later than a typical retirement date for someone of Mr. McCullough's age.\n   <footnotemark>\n    53\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, under the criteria typically applied by the courts, Mr. McCullough's 100-year sentence would be regarded as equivalent to a sentence of life without parole - a sentence categorically precluded by the Eighth Amendment for a juvenile offender convicted of a non-homicide offense such as assault.\n   <footnotemark>\n    54\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-209\">\n   Of course, Mr. McCullough's sentence did not result from a single assault conviction, but rather from the maximum sentences for four such convictions run consecutively.\n   <footnotemark>\n    55\n   </footnotemark>\n   The circumstances of Mr.\n   McCullough's stacked sentence, however, appear to be towards the lower end of the spectrum described in the previous section of this opinion. All of his convictions related to a single incident on a single day. Although the offenses were very serious in their execution and in their consequences and Mr. McCullough was characterized as the instigator of the incident, it appears that he was convicted as an aider and abettor of the offenses rather than as the principal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    56\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under the analysis of the previous section of this opinion, we would thus consider Mr. McCullough's sentence no differently than a single sentence for purposes of\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   .\n   5. Remand\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-210\">\n   Given our conclusion that the 100-year sentence imposed in his case violated the Eighth Amendment under the standard articulated in\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   , Mr. McCullough will have to be re-sentenced to a disposition that is not equivalent to life without parole. So long as the sentence is within the constraints set by the Eighth Amendment, the Circuit Court on remand has its usual broad discretion in selecting an appropriate sentence, taking into account the circumstances of the offenses, their impact on victims, Mr. McCullough's culpability, his status as a juvenile offender, the State's sentencing guidelines, and other factors typically considered by a sentencing court.\n   <em>\n    Jackson v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1279906\" index=\"221\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/364/192/#p199\">\n    364 Md. 192\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 199-200,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1279906\" index=\"222\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/364/192/#p199\">\n    772 A.2d 273\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2001) ;\n   <em>\n    Jennings v.

The constraint imposed by the Eighth Amendment is that, while the sentence \"is not required to guarantee eventual freedom,\" it must allow a \"meaningful opportunity to obtain release based on demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation\" so that Mr. McCullough has \"hope for some years of life outside the prison walls.\" In our view, that means a sentence with parole eligibility significantly short of the 50-year mark. By comparison, if Mr. McCullough had been convicted of four separate crimes of violence and been sentenced to life without parole under CR \u00a7 14-101(c), he would become eligible to seek parole at age 60, after 43 years of confinement. Consistent with\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   , whatever sentence is imposed must allow such an opportunity for parole, but there is no guarantee or promise that Mr. McCullough will be released on parole then or ever.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-211\">\n   In stating the reasons for whatever sentence is imposed, the court may wish to relate those reasons to the general objectives of criminal sentences.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Maryland Rule 4-342(f) ;\n   <em>\n    State v.

Whether the officials involved in the parole system actually carry out their duties in accordance with the applicable laws is not before us.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-216\">\n   (2) A sentence of 100 years, comprised of consecutive maximum sentences for assault convictions arising out of a single incident, under which a juvenile offender will not be eligible for parole consideration for 50 years is tantamount to a sentence of life without parole. Accordingly, the Eighth Amendment, as interpreted by the United States Supreme Court, precludes such a sentence and Mr. McCullough must be re-sentenced to a sentence that allows a \"meaningful opportunity to obtain release based on demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-217\">\n   <strong>\n    IN NO. 54, JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS VACATED AND CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT WITH INSTRUCTIONS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-218\">\n   <strong>\n    TO AFFIRM THE JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY.

Mr. McCullough was convicted in 2005 of four counts of first-degree assault stemming from \"a single incident on a single day.\" Maj. Op. at 363, 192 A.3d at 735. Mr. McCullough, 17 years old at the time of the crime, was sentenced on each of the assault convictions to 25 years of incarceration, to be served consecutively; as a consequence, he has, in the aggregate, a 100-year sentence and is eligible for parole upon serving 50 years of that aggregate sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-226\">\n   The Majority poses the question of \"whether a sentence stated as a term of years for a juvenile offender can ever be regarded as a sentence of life without parole for purposes of the Eighth Amendment\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-227\">\n   and answers that question in the affirmative:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-228\">\n   It seems a matter of common sense that the answer must be \"yes.\" Otherwise, the Eighth Amendment proscription against cruel and unusual punishment in the context of a juvenile offender could be circumvented simply by stating the sentence in numerical terms that exceed any reasonable life expectancy rather than labeling it a \"life\" sentence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-229\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-230\">\n   This conclusion is supported not simply by common sense or by a straw poll of other courts.

Op. at 347-49, 192 A.3d at 725-26. In further explanation of why the answer is \"yes,\" the Majority concludes, and I agree, that in Mr. McCullough's case (and, I would think, other similarly situated juvenile offenders) the term of years sentence he received is \"tantamount to a sentence of life without parole.\" Maj. Op. at 365, 192 A.3d at 736.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-232\">\n   I fully embrace the Majority's reasoning and therefore join the outcome in Mr. McCullough's case. From there, however, my path and that of the Majority diverge. I dissent to the Majority's holdings in the cases of Mr. Carter and Mr. Bowie.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-233\">\n   Much of the Majority's opinion is to be admired. The opinion includes a well-crafted description of Maryland's statutory and regulatory parole scheme and the relevant case law, including not only the U.S. Supreme Court's Eighth Amendment decisions on the subject but also the relevant case law from Maryland, many of our sister states, and federal district and circuit courts. The Majority likewise devotes much ink, appropriately so, to the Executive Order issued by Governor Hogan several days after the Court heard oral argument in the three cases that are the subject of this opinion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   I have no quarrel with either the Majority's description of Maryland's current parole system and pertinent case law or, for that matter, much of the legal analysis that follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-234\">\n   My quarrel is with the holding of Section II, Part 3 that the Governor's 2018 Executive Order together with the Maryland Parole Commission's (\"Commission\") regulation concerning\n   parole for juvenile offenders, COMAR 12.08.01.18A(3), make an otherwise unconstitutional Maryland parole system compliant with the dictates of the Eighth Amendment. Maj. Op. at 342-46, 192 A.3d at 722-24. Although the Majority reads the Supreme Court's cases correctly, it applies those cases to Maryland's process in an aspirational rather than a realistic manner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-235\">\n   The clear directive that emerges from\n   <em>\n    Graham v.

Maryland's current parole scheme, when viewed in light of the Commission's regulation and the Executive Order, calls for consideration of a number of factors. But mere consideration of those factors falls short of the federal constitutional benchmark. If\n   \"demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation\" is a factor only to be \"considered\" rather than a necessary and sufficient condition of release, then the Commission remains free, in the exercise of unfettered discretion, to decline even to forward a recommendation of parole to the Governor. Further, were the Governor to receive a recommendation in favor of parole for a juvenile offender serving a life sentence, there remains in the Executive Order the Governor's exercise of discretion to deny parole notwithstanding that, by the terms of the Executive Order, the Governor \"shall consider\" certain additional factors.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although the Executive Order certainly goes some distance\n   in the direction of complying with the Supreme Court's decisions in\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Montgomery\n   </em>\n   , it falls short of achieving that goal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-236\">\n   The Majority correctly concludes that in light of\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Montgomery\n   </em>\n   , the statute describing eligibility for parole-\u00a7 7-301 of the Correctional Services Article (\"CS\")-is on its face unconstitutional as applied to juvenile offenders. Maj. Op. at 340-41, 192 A.3d at 721. CS \u00a7 7-301 does not distinguish between juvenile and adult offenders and therefore violates\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   and its progeny. The Majority decides, however, that the Executive Order, which I agree has the force of law, bridges the gap between CS \u00a7 7-301 and what, under the\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Montgomery\n   </em>\n   trilogy, is required by the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Maj. Op. at 346, 192 A.3d at 724.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-237\">\n   I am not persuaded that either the Executive Order or COMAR 12.08.01.18A(3),\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   or the two authorities together, cures the constitutional infirmity of Maryland's current parole\n   system. I come to that conclusion because neither the Executive Order nor the regulation includes any sort of standard to guide the exercise of discretion, much less a standard that satisfies the Eighth Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-238\">\n   The Majority's analysis is flawed for the same reason that Maryland's parole system is unconstitutional: both purport to \"consider\" the guidance of the Supreme\n   Court without ascribing any weight to specific factors or indicating in which direction those factors militate. The Majority relies on the laudable intent of the Executive Order and the Commission's regulation rather than on their respective texts. Neither the regulation nor the Executive Order, however, sufficiently cabins the discretion that the Commission and the Governor each wield, so as to render constitutional that which currently is not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-239\">\n   The Commission's regulation, COMAR 12.08.01.18A(3), as noted by the Majority, was promulgated in response to\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   and its progeny. Maj. Op. at 321 n.14, 192 A.3d at 710 n.14. In the absence of standards that guide the Commissioners' exercise of discretion, the regulation leaves them free to \"consider\" the listed factors but then to accord little or no relative weight to one or more of them in deciding whether a juvenile offender is \"suitable\" for parole. The regulation also does not specify in which direction-either in support of or against parole-the listed factors should militate. In the absence of any standard for exercising discretion, a Commissioner has no guidance on how to assess and weigh, for example, the factor described as \"home environment and family relationships at the time,\" COMAR 12.08.01.18A(3)(e). Is that factor intended to cut in favor of or against parole, and how much weight should it receive in relation to the other factors? Nothing in the regulation hints at the answer. Without standards that sufficiently guide the exercise of discretion, whether by the Commission or the Governor, our current system renders the possibility of parole an empty promise for juvenile offenders serving life sentences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-240\">\n   I close with this: One might imagine that, were he with us to speak on the subject today, Thomas Aquinas, whose quoted words stand at the outset of the Majority's opinion, likely would conclude that the result reached by the Majority is neither just nor merciful. Maj. Op. at 306 &amp; n.1, 192 A.3d at 701 &amp; n.1. It is neither just nor merciful, much less compliant with the Eighth Amendment, that, currently in Maryland, a young teenager who commits a crime that leads to a life sentence is likely to spend the rest of his or her life in prison. And it is not justice to have on the books the \"possibility of parole\" yet provide a protocol for granting or denying parole that is without standards to guide those who are the decision makers: the Parole Commission and the Governor. Under the United States Constitution, a meaningful opportunity for release cannot exist in name only, as it now does in Maryland. I would therefore reverse the judgments of the Court of Special Appeals in Mr. Carter's and Mr. Bowie's cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-241\">\n   Judge Greene and Judge Adkins have authorized me to state that they join this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-242\">\n   Watts, J., which Getty, J., joins.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-243\">\n   Respectfully, I concur with the majority opinion as to\n   <em>\n    Carter\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Bowie\n   </em>\n   , but I dissent as to\n   <em>\n    McCullough\n   </em>\n   . I agree with the Majority's conclusion that \"a lengthy term-of-years sentence can be a life sentence for purposes of the Eighth Amendment.\" Maj. Op. at 349, 192 A.3d at 726. I disagree, however, with the Majority's reasoning that McCullough's sentence was the equivalent of a life sentence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 361-62, 192 A.3d at 733-34. I would affirm the Court of Special Appeals's judgment, and I would adopt the Honorable Deborah Sweet Eyler's sound logic that McCullough's sentence was not the equivalent of a life sentence because the age at which he will become eligible for parole (67) is within his life expectancy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McCullough v.

Op. at 366, 192 A.3d at 725 (emphasis added). Thus, multiple of our fellow State Supreme Courts, as well as multiple federal appellate courts, have used a defendant's life expectancy as a benchmark to determine whether a sentence of a term of years is the equivalent of a life sentence.

First, although other States' legislatures have purported to codify\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   , the General Assembly has not. I see no reason to consider statutes that have no force in Maryland. Additionally, it is up to courts, not legislatures, to interpret and apply the Eighth Amendment. Although legislatures can attempt to do so, the ultimate responsibility rests\n   with courts. I would not abdicate our role as interpreters of the Constitution by relying on statutes, as opposed to case law, while analyzing the Eighth Amendment. Furthermore, as demonstrated by the wide gap in various other States' statutes (ranging from 15 years to 40 years), the amount of time that a defendant must serve before becoming eligible for parole is a matter of an individual State's legislative choice. The Majority conjures up a standard based on these statutes by stating that all of them involve time periods that are \"significantly less than 50 years[.]\" Maj. Op. at 352,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"300\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=192%20A.3d%20729\">\n    192 A.3d at 728\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Majority then applies that standard by remanding to the circuit court with instructions to impose a sentence that will allow McCullough the opportunity to be released \"significantly short of the 50-year mark.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 364,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"301\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=192%20A.3d%20729\">\n    192 A.3d at 735\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Majority does not explain why it does not set the bar at 50 years, as certain other courts have done, but rather mandates that McCullough's sentence be reduced to a sentence that allows parole eligibility at a point significantly less than 50 years.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 351-53,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"302\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=192%20A.3d%20729\">\n    192 A.3d at 727-29, 735\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-259\">\n   I would not adopt the 50-year bar that some other courts have used, and I certainly would not utilize the significantly less than 50 years standard that the Majority\n   gins up. Both of these standards (50 years and \"significantly short of the 50-year mark\") would tie the hands of sentencing courts, which need to be able to fashion sentences that take into account the circumstances of the crimes, the defendant's characteristics, the need to protect the community, and the goals of rehabilitation and deterrence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-260\">\n   As to the circumstances of the crime, the Majority attempts to downplay the seriousness of McCullough's convictions by observing that they \"related to a single incident on a single day[,]\" and that he was apparently convicted as an aider and abettor, as opposed to a principal.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 363,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"303\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=192%20A.3d%20729\">\n    192 A.3d at 735\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . These circumstances do not justify the Majority's conclusion that McCullough's sentence violates the Eighth Amendment. The question is not how blameworthy McCullough's crimes were; the question is whether his sentence is the equivalent of a life sentence. I would answer that question in the negative by applying the benchmark that several other State Supreme\n   Courts, federal appellate courts, and the Court of Special Appeals have utilized-namely, whether a defendant will become eligible for parole within his or her life expectancy. The Court of Special Appeals determined that life expectancy was the appropriate benchmark and that the 100-year aggregate sentence was not cruel and unusual punishment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McCullough\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12314323,12490742\" index=\"304\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/233/702/\">\n    233 Md.

However, the procedural posture of that case - deferential collateral review of a state court decision under the federal Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (\"AEDPA\") - means that the case provides limited guidance for our purposes. In\n    <em>\n     LeBlanc\n    </em>\n    , a state court, relying on a decision of its supreme court, had rejected an argument that the possibility of geriatric release failed to satisfy the Eighth Amendment. The Fourth Circuit, however, affirmed a grant of postconviction relief citing\n    <em>\n     Graham\n    </em>\n    . The Supreme Court summarily reversed, in a\n    <em>\n     per curiam\n    </em>\n    opinion. The Supreme Court explicitly did not decide whether geriatric release would satisfy the Eighth Amendment, but only that the Fourth Circuit had not accorded the state court decision on the issue the deference due under AEDPA and that the state court decision was \"not objectively unreasonable.\" Justice Ginsburg concurred separately, stating her understanding that the state parole board was required under state law to consider \"the normal parole factors, including rehabilitation and maturity.\"\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604749\" index=\"330\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1726/\">\n     137 S.Ct. at 1730\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .
