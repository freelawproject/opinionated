INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On November 14, 2014, the Judicial Conduct Board (Board) filed a Complaint against Magisterial District Judge Robert Jennings, III, alleging that then-Judge Jennings violated various provisions of the Rules Governing Standards of Conduct of Magisterial District Judges and the Pennsylvania Constitution. These allegations included that Judge Jennings demanded constables receiving work from his judicial office contribute ten percent of their earnings to Judge Jennings's reelection campaign fund. Contemporaneously, the Board filed a Petition to Suspend With or Without Pay, and this Court suspended Jennings with pay on November 17, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On September 18, 2015, the Office of Attorney General filed criminal charges against Jennings stemming from substantially the same conduct as was alleged in the disciplinary case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   After the filing of the criminal case the Board filed a Petition asking the Court to change the suspension to one without pay. Through counsel Jennings filed a response, and the Court suspended Jennings without pay on July 29, 2015. Soon thereafter Jennings resigned his commission as a magisterial district judge in Dauphin County. The litigation of this case was stayed while the criminal case was prosecuted.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On September 11, 2017, Jennings entered a plea of\n   <em>\n    nolo contendere\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   to charges of 18 Pa.

No. 502 (D)(3).\n   </strong>\n   A status conference was held on June 13, 2018, for the purpose of determining whether the stipulations included enough of the facts upon which the criminal prosecution was premised in order to permit the court to fairly\n   consider the connection between any criminal conduct and Jennings's judicial office. As stated above, we have accepted the stipulations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \"The effect of a\n   <em>\n    nolo contendere\n   </em>\n   plea in Pennsylvania ... when accepted ... is an implied confession of guilt only, and cannot be used against the defendant as an admission in any civil suit for the same act.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Eisenberg v.

He later sought to contest his suspension by the state Department of Public Welfare from the Medicaid Program by arguing that his\n   <em>\n    nolo contendere\n   </em>\n   plea was not an admission of the fraud.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The Pennsylvania Supreme Court held that the Department of Public Welfare's suspension could properly be predicated upon the criminal conviction of mail fraud without relying upon the facts of the underlying criminal case. \"[H]ere, [the Department] does not attempt to use the plea as a judicial admission of the fraud. Rather, the conviction entered upon the plea itself is the operative fact which authorizes the suspension.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Eisenberg\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 336.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Meth v.

First, the Board maintains that the colloquy between the criminal judge and Jennings included a recitation of the facts to which Respondent then entered his nolo plea. Second, the Board maintains this case has similarity to the recent case of\n   <em>\n    In re Joy.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The case of\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     In re Joy\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , Docket No. 12 JD 2015, involved a plea of\n   <em>\n    nolo contendere\n   </em>\n   to two counts of Official Oppression, 18 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 5301(1), both misdemeanors of the second degree. Sentence was imposed and then-Judge Joy stood convicted of two misdemeanors of the second degree. This Court considered stipulations filed by the parties that included the recitation of facts made during the proceeding where Judge Joy pleaded\n   <em>\n    nolo contendere.\n   </em>\n   Joy was found in violation and the sanction of removal was imposed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Lastly, the Board maintains that Stipulation No. 14, by itself, is a stipulation that includes reference to the conduct that gave rise to the criminal prosecution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Here, without the need to evaluate whether we should consider the factual recitation at the plea colloquy we can nevertheless conclude that Jennings's criminal conviction was connected to his judicial duties. This is because one of the statutes\n   to which Respondent pleaded\n   <em>\n    nolo contendere\n   </em>\n   , Criminal Coercion, defines the crime as \"[a] person is guilty of criminal coercion, if, with the intent unlawfully to restrict freedom of action of another to the detriment of the other, he threatens to: ... (4) take or withhold action as an official, or cause an official to take or withhold an action.\" 18 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 2709. Because official action can only arise from Respondent's duties as a judge, it is evident that Respondent's criminal activity was linked to his judicial duties. In addition, Stipulation No. 14 provides additional facts that establish the nature of the conduct in which Jennings engaged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   We now turn to whether these two misdemeanor convictions, including one that necessarily involves the taking or withholding of judicial discretion for criminal purposes, establish the five violations alleged by the Board.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Count I alleges that these convictions constitute of violation of Old Rule 2, that judges \"shall respect and comply with the law and shall conduct themselves at all times in a manner that promotes public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Count II alleges Jennings's convictions constitute a violation of Old Rule 12, which provides \"judges ... shall not engage ... in any activity ... incompatible with the expeditious, proper and impartial discharge of their duties, including, but not limited to: (1) in any activity prohibited by law.\" Count III alleges a violation of the Constitutional provision that provides that a judge may be disciplined for \"conduct which prejudices the proper administration of justice.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   It is easy to conclude that Jennings's criminal conviction is a violation of Old Rule 2 and Old Rule 12. By definition, the taking or withholding of any official act sufficient to constitute a violation of 18 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 2709(a)(4) is not complying with the law, is incompatible with the expeditious, proper and impartial discharge of judicial duties, and prejudices the administration of justice. Criminal activity is necessarily a departure from the standard of conduct expected of our judges. The citizens of Pennsylvania rightfully expect our judges to comply with the law. Such criminal acts also disrupt the systematic and lawful operation of our judicial system. Any act which corrupts the judicial process, even if the final result is the same as might have attained absent the corrupt purposes, prejudices the administration of justice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     In re Segal,\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12145518\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/151/734/#p736\">\n    151 A.3d 734\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 736 (Pa.Ct.Jud.Disc. 2016)\n   <em>\n    aff'd\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12348873,12348854\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/173/603/\">\n    173 A.3d 603\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Pa. 2017) (rejecting argument that the same result would have been reached without the\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ex parte\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   communication). Therefore, Jennings has also violated Article V, Section 18(d)(1) of the Pennsylvania Constitution by engaging in conduct that prejudiced the administration of justice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Count IV alleges that Jennings engaged in conduct which brings the office into disrepute. Our Court has repeatedly said that not all conduct that violates the applicable judicial conduct rules can be said to bring the judicial office, rather than the offending jurist him or herself, into disrepute. \"It cannot be\n   <em>\n    presumed\n   </em>\n   that a violation of any other provision, constitutional, canonical or criminal automatically lowers public acceptance of the authority of the judicial office.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     In re Carney,\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7272210\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/28/253/#p266\">\n    28 A.3d 253\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 266-67 (Pa.Ct.Jud.Disc. 2011) (quoting\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     In re Smith,\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7364240\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/687/1229/\">\n    687 A.2d 1229\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Pa.Ct.Jud.Disc. 1996) (italics in original; internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In order to bring disrepute upon the judiciary as a whole, rather than just upon the offending judge, the judicial officer \"must have engaged in conduct which\n   <em>\n    is so extreme\n   </em>\n   that it brings the judicial office into disrepute.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 267 (italics in original; internal quotation marks omitted).

They are vital to the functioning of our judicial system, and serve much of the same purpose as does the Sheriff in the courts of common pleas, as the \"arm of the court.\" They are compensated through receiving case-specific assignments to serve arrest warrants, bench warrants, and other civil process at rates specified by law.\n   <strong>\n    See 44 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 7161.\n   </strong>\n   Magisterial district judges are vested with discretion in choosing the constables to whom they assign warrants and civil process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Jennings's criminal conviction for conditioning the taking or withholding of an official act upon an ulterior purpose is a criminal conviction premised upon an act of corruption. Such an act causes serious damage not only on the offending judge and his or her judicial office itself, but also upon the entire judiciary. Our citizens expect that our judicial system will operate fairly and that judges will uphold the law. Jennings, however, used his judicial position for personal gain by pressuring others over whom he had discretion to give or withhold compensated work for the judicial system to contribute money in an attempt to secure his continued election to judicial office. His act of what amounts to extortion over state constables fits squarely with the other severe and corrupt acts that this Court has evaluated, and where we have consistently found disrepute. Accordingly, we find that Jennings has violated Article V, \u00a7 18(d)(1) by engaging in conduct that brings the judicial office into disrepute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Count V alleges a violation of Article V, \u00a7 17(b) that provides that our judges must comply with the rules or canons prescribed by the Supreme Court. Each of our findings above constitutes an automatic, derivative, violation of Section 17(b) of our Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    II.
