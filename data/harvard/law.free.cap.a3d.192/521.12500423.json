After Morris failed to appear in court as required, the court ordered the bond forfeited. The plaintiff in error claims that the trial court violated its right to due process in numerous ways during the adjudication of its motion for release and that, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-65c, it was entitled to release from its surety obligation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The plaintiff in error's procedural due process claims were not preserved below, and we have, therefore, reviewed them pursuant to the standard set forth in\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"566558\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/213/233/#p239\">\n    213 Conn. 233\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 239-40,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=567%20A.2d%20823\">\n    567 A.2d 823\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1989), as modified by\n   <em>\n    In re Yasiel R.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=317%20Conn.%20773\">\n    317 Conn. 773\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 781,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=120%20A.3d%201188\">\n    120 A.3d 1188\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015). Having thoroughly reviewed the record, we are not persuaded that the plaintiff in error's right to due process was infringed in any manner. We also conclude that the court properly denied the plaintiff in error's motion for release from its surety obligations. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the trial court denying the plaintiff in error's motion for release.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The writ of error is denied.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
