Zarnoch (Senior Judge, Specially Assigned), JJ.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Zarnoch, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This case arises out of appellee Andrew Cohen's (\"Mr. Cohen\") failure to pay child support to his ex-wife Jessica Cohen (\"Ms. Cohen\"), which prompted the Montgomery County Office of Child Support Enforcement (\"the agency\" or \"MCOCSE\") to block Mr. Cohen's ability to obtain a passport. The decision of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County to order MCOCSE to remove its hold on Mr. Cohen's passport application and to retain court control of the passport raises concerns involving the separation of powers between Maryland's judicial and executive branches, as well as a state court's authority to encroach on the duties of the United States Secretary of State. On appeal to this Court, MCOCSE asks that we review one issue, which we have reworded slightly:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-10\">\n   Whether the circuit court erred when it ordered MCOCSE to release a block against Mr. Cohen's passport, despite state and federal laws that clearly mandated MCOCSE's action and the Secretary of State's denial of his passport for his failure to pay child support.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   For the reasons we explain below, we reverse the decision of the circuit court and remand for further proceedings so that Mr. Cohen's passport may be transferred to the Secretary of State.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND &amp; PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Mr. Cohen had two children with Ms. Cohen -- a daughter, born in 1996, and a son, born in 2007. The Circuit Court for Howard County entered a judgment of absolute divorce in August of 2012, and Ms. Cohen was awarded primary physical custody of the children. The court ordered Mr. Cohen to pay directly to Ms. Cohen $800.00 per month as support for the parties' children pursuant to an agreement between the parties, beginning on October 15, 2012. On December 16, 2013, the Circuit Court for Howard County granted a motion filed by Ms. Cohen for a change of venue to the Circuit Court for Montgomery County.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Once the case was transferred, Ms. Cohen filed a petition for contempt against Mr. Cohen for his failure to pay child support in accordance with the prior order, and moved for sole legal custody. The circuit court denied Ms. Cohen's request to hold Mr. Cohen in contempt, but awarded Ms. Cohen sole legal custody of the children, ordered that Mr. Cohen's access to the children would be subject to Ms. Cohen's consent, entered a judgment in favor of Ms. Cohen in the amount of $8,000.00 in unpaid child support as of June 30, 2014, and ordered that all future payments must be submitted to MCOCSE. Regarding the $8,000 arrearage, which had accumulated since October of 2012, the court ordered Mr. Cohen to pay a minimum of $200.00 per month, in addition to his principal child support payment, until the total arrearage was paid in full. Further, the court entered an Earnings Withholding Order to be served on Mr. Cohen's then employer \"or any future employer\" to ensure timely child support payments in the future.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On March 4, 2016, MCOCSE filed a motion on Mr. Cohen's behalf, seeking a modification of his monthly child support obligation, because he was no longer required to pay child support for his adult daughter. On June 10, 2016, the court modified the child support order by consent and lowered Mr. Cohen's monthly support obligation to $436.00 per month, effective as of March 1, 2016, to reflect his obligation only for the parties' son. Regarding Mr. Cohen's overdue support for both children, which had increased to a total of $21,733.22 as of June 6, 2016, the circuit court ordered him to pay an additional $109.00 per month towards the arrearage for a total monthly obligation of $545.00 to begin on July 1, 2016. After the circuit court lowered Mr. Cohen's monthly support obligation, he did not pay any support until November 21, 2016, when he made a lump sum payment of $3,000.00.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In May of 2017, Mr. Cohen applied for a passport in order to travel to Greece for a ten-day vacation with his girlfriend and her family. The Department of State, who oversees the issuance of passports, denied his application because it had received certification from MCOCSE that his child support arrears were more than $2,500.00.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   On May 24, 2017, Mr. Cohen filed \"Defendant's Petition for MCOCSE Release of\n   Passport Hold\" with the circuit court. Specifically, Cohen requested that the circuit court do the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   1. Order [MCOCSE] to release the hold on the Defendant's ability to obtain a passport for the sole purpose of allowing his planned trip in August to Greece;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   2. Order that by August 31, Defendant will submit his passport to the Court for holding until his arrearages are paid or pending further Court Order ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The primary reason asserted by Mr. Cohen to have the block removed was that his girlfriend's father, Leonard Sloan\n   (\"Mr. Sloan\"), was paying for Mr. Cohen's travel expenses. He argued that the trip was planned without his knowledge of his ineligibility for a passport, and that he would continue working for his current employer upon his return. Further, Mr. Cohen claimed in his petition that \"since the Consent Order [of June 10, 2016] was entered, Defendant has paid his child support on time and in full, pursuant to the agreement.\" Attached to the petition was an affidavit of Mr. Sloan, who affirmed that it was his \"clear intention to pay for the family, and specifically for Andrew Cohen's meals, excursions and other miscellaneous expenses associated with the trip.\" Mr. Sloan added that he had \"taken similar family trips in the past with [his] family (to Puerto Rico, Italy, the Outer Banks, etc.), and [had] paid all costs involved.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   MCOCSE opposed the petition, noting first that Mr. Cohen's claim that he had paid his child support on time and in full since the date of the last consent order was not accurate. As MCOCSE pointed out, Mr. Cohen had not made any payments at all between April 22, 2016 and November 21, 2016, when he finally made a $3,000 payment\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   -- $2,564.00 of which was applied to his burgeoning arrearage. Further, MCOCSE noted in its opposition that Mr. Cohen's reason for obtaining a passport was not a serious one, such as a family emergency overseas or an employment opportunity for which the statutory/administrative scheme provides narrow exceptions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   MCOCSE averred, therefore, that Mr. Cohen's situation -- having failed to pay more than $21,000.00 in child support but wanting to travel with his girlfriend's family merely for leisure -- illustrated the very purpose for the passport denial provisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The circuit court held a hearing on June 21, 2017 and permitted Mr. Cohen to participate by telephone because he\n   resided in Florida at that time. MCOCSE asserted at the hearing that, following the child support order in 2012, Mr. Cohen had not made any payments for nearly three years. His first support payments began only after the court ordered that Mr. Cohen's wages be garnished. Even after the reduction in his minimum monthly child support payment, Mr. Cohen failed to make any payments from April to November of 2016. Following that gap, he made a lump sum payment of $3,000 from an inheritance and then stopped making payments again until the end of January 2017, when MCOCSE imposed another wage withholding order on his most recent employer. By the time of the June 21, 2017 hearing, Mr. Cohen owed $21,377.13 in overdue child support, and the only periods during which Mr. Cohen made timely, consistent payments were the result of the agency obtaining wage withholding orders.\n   At the end of the hearing, however, the circuit court granted Mr. Cohen's petition. The court ordered MCOCSE to \"release the Passport Hold\" immediately, and for Mr. Cohen to surrender his passport to the circuit court by August 31, 2017, providing that the circuit court \"shall hold [Mr. Cohen's] passport until the full balance of arrears is paid or until further Order of Court.\" The day after the hearing, MCOCSE filed a motion to alter or amend the judgment and a motion to stay, which the circuit court denied. MCOCSE then filed a motion to stay the case pending appeal to this Court, and the circuit court denied the motion in an order on July 20, 2017. MCOCSE, therefore, released the hold on Mr. Cohen's passport the same day. Following Mr. Cohen's vacation, he turned over his passport to the circuit court, where we assume it remains today. MCOCSE timely appealed to this Court, and Mr. Cohen did not file an appellee's brief.

In our view, the plain language of the pertinent Maryland and federal statutes and regulations governing the denial of passports for a substantial child support arrearage dictate a different result here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    II. The Circuit Court Erred By Ordering MCOCSE to \"Release the Hold\" on Mr. Cohen's Passport.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The circuit court gave the following ruling at the hearing on the petition:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   Okay. Well, I mean, I can see both sides of it, and I guess from the policy view, the policy view of the child support enforcement agency would say well, I guess what Mr. Sloan should do is give him the money that would pay for the trip and say use this towards your child support. So, you know, it would have cost, I don't know, $5,000, $10,000 for you to go to Greece. But let's use that $5,000 or $10,000. You'll miss this trip, but you'll pay off half of your child support\n   obligation. And that's certainly one way that it could have been done. [ ... ] But that didn't happen.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   But on the other hand, Mr. Cohen is belatedly up to date on the ... modified child support order. I mean, this is the current child support order. He's complying\n   with the current child support order. As long as he's paying the $550 a month, that's really what he's obligated to do. And yes, the arrearage is going to stay there and it's going to go down slowly. And he has a choice, I guess, as to how to pay it down, whether it takes ten years or he could do it in ten minutes if he had the $20,000.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   But it also sounds like he has other obligations. And I know they're not directly related, but if he's helping his older daughter and helping his son with private school and all the rest of it, he's not just some deadbeat dad who disappeared to Florida and hasn't been heard from since. Now, I agree, if he had just disappeared and the arrearage was $20,000 and counting and he wasn't paying anything, then obviously he shouldn't have a passport. But under all these circumstances, I am going to grant the motion.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Thereafter, Mr. Cohen's attorney inquired, \"I'd ask that the Court I guess retain jurisdiction in case there's wording that needs to be changed. But I believe this [draft order] should be sufficient.\" The court agreed to \"look into it ... with the State Department,\" presumably regarding the language necessary to have the hold removed, and concluded the hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

At this stage, the passport was \"previously issued\" to Mr. Cohen, and therefore, the Secretary of State will have the discretion to revoke the passport once MCOCSE re-certifies Mr. Cohen to the federal executive branch. This shift in focus of the presently applicable federal statute does not make the case moot.

The circuit court's decision infringed on the child support enforcement duties of MCOCSE, and the potential exists for the circuit court to release the passport to Mr. Cohen again. Mr. Sloan's affidavit stated that he frequently pays for international vacations for his family; therefore, if Mr. Cohen files another petition seeking the use of his passport, the circuit court could find that Mr. Cohen has made a recent effort to pay towards his arrearage and decide to release the passport to him for the same reasons that it issued its order in this case. Accordingly, to remedy the ongoing contravention of the statutory/administrative process caused by the circuit court's retention of the passport, we address the merits of the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The Circuit Court Did Not Have Authority to Order MCOCSE to Release the Hold on Mr. Cohen's Passport.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   In reaching its conclusion, the circuit court suggested that the primary purpose of the passport denial statute was to prevent delinquent noncustodial parents from spending money on international travel that could go to their unsupported children instead. During MCOCSE's argument, the court responded, \"I think the point of the law is you don't want people to use what money they have to go travel or -- of course this is just one thing.\" The court added, \"So [the passport denial statute] is just a way, I guess, of encouraging people not to, you know, take expensive trips when they should be using that money for child support, right? But I guess what [Mr. Cohen] is saying is it's not his money.\" The circuit court concluded that the agency's argument was that \"Mr. Sloan should ... give [Mr. Cohen] the money that would pay for the trip and say use this towards your child support.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Because the most recent child support order reduced the amount that Mr. Cohen was required to pay towards the overdue child support per month, and he had made a lump sum payment of $3,000 since the order, the court reasoned that Mr. Cohen was \"belatedly up to date.\" The court explained,\n   \"He's complying with the current child support order. As long as he's paying the $550 a month, that's really what he's obligated to do.\" Although Mr. Cohen had failed to make consistent, voluntary payments under any agreement or order, the court found that Mr. Cohen \"has a choice, I guess, as to how to pay it down, whether it takes ten years or he could do it in ten minutes if he had the $20,000.\" For all of these reasons, the court reached the following conclusion:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   [Mr. Cohen is] not just some deadbeat dad who disappeared to Florida and hasn't been heard from since.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Now, I agree, if he had just disappeared and the\n   arrearage was $20,000 and counting and he wasn't paying anything, then obviously he shouldn't have a passport. But under all these circumstances, I am going to grant the motion.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     i. The circuit court's order encroached on the authority of the State's executive branch and violated separation of powers principles.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Complicating this case is its procedural posture when the circuit court ordered the agency to reverse its certification of Mr. Cohen, prior to any administrative review by the Administration -- a result that, in our view, violated separation of powers principles.

More specifically, MCOCSE's duty, as a \"state agency\" referred to in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20652\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 652\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (k), is also mandatory under the Maryland regulations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   COMAR 07.07.17.02(A) (Emphasis added) (stating that the agency \"\n   <em>\n    shall\n   </em>\n   certify to OCSE an obligor whose support obligation arrearage exceeds $2,500\"). Mr. Cohen was in arrears well above the $2,500 threshold. His circumstances, therefore, fell within the scope of MCOCSE's authority and duty to report the arrearage to the Secretary of HHS, whether or not the circuit court found that this enforcement measure would be effective in Mr. Cohen's situation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The Maryland regulations provide two exceptions under which an obligor, who has failed to pay the child support arrearage in full, can avoid the denial of his or her passport application.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   COMAR 07.07.17.06 requires that MCOCSE request that the OCSE \"withdraw the passport denial\" if: (1) the obligor has \"[p]rovided documentation from [an] employer that a passport is required for employment purposes and that the Administration has been paid an agreed upon amount ....\"; or (2) the \"Secretary of the Department [of Human Services] or a designee ... determines that the passport denial or revocation would result in undue hardship.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   COMAR 07.07.17.06(B), (D). Clearly, there is no exception for noncustodial parents who have made a belated effort to comply with a child support order but maintain an arrearage above the $2,500 threshold. Further, no exception exists for noncustodial parents who can establish\\h that all vacation expenses will be paid by someone else. No exception exists for any balancing of the equities. Upon his receipt of the denial of his passport, Mr. Cohen had the right to challenge MCOCSE's certification\n   through the proper administrative procedure. He did not, however, have\n   the right to circumvent the administrative process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Absent judicial intervention, the denial of Mr. Cohen's passport might have worked as an effective enforcement mechanism. For instance, Mr. Cohen's efforts to file a petition to have the block removed so that he could benefit from Mr. Sloan's gift of an all-expense paid vacation demonstrates that the restriction on his passport motivated Mr. Cohen to take action to avoid the restriction on his ability to travel internationally. As Mr. Sloan's affidavit indicated, he has paid for exotic vacations for his family on numerous occasions. Thus, if Mr. Cohen had been forced to miss this trip as a consequence of his child support arrearage, he might have made a more fervent effort to pay off the balance of overdue support in order to accept similar gifts in the future.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   It is true that Mr. Cohen had the option to pay only the minimum amount towards his arrearage without the threat of being held in contempt. His recent payments towards the arrearage, however, did not shield him from all other consequences of his failure to support his children in the past.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   The thrust of the passport denial statute's effectiveness is that it \"focuses the mind of a parent ... on ... the need to support one's child first.\"\n   <em>\n    Risenhoover\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3802388\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/545/885/#p890\">\n    545 F.Supp.2d at 890\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Regardless of how a trip is funded, such a focus ultimately comes from the obligor's desire to travel internationally and, therefore, to have the restriction lifted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   For these reasons, the circuit court erred in granting Mr. Cohen's petition, ordering MCOCSE to release the block on his passport, and its retention of control over the passport after Mr. Cohen returned from Greece. His ability to obtain a\n   passport fell within the authority of Maryland's Department of Human Services and the United States Secretary of State, under a statutory scheme enacted by Congress and adopted by the General Assembly of Maryland. In addition, the circuit court's control over the passport continues to interfere with the Secretary of State's exclusive authority over the restriction of Mr. Cohen's passport. Accordingly, we reverse the circuit court's order requiring MCOCSE to remove its hold on Mr. Cohen's passport and remand the case for further proceedings. The circuit court must turn over the passport at issue to the agency, and MCOCSE must re-certify Mr. Cohen to the Secretary of HHS and arrange to transfer the passport to the Secretary of State. The Secretary of State may decide, under his or her statutory authority, whether to revoke or restrict the passport.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <strong>\n    JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR MONTGOMERY COUNTY REVERSED AND CASE REMANDED FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION.
