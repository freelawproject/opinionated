The defendants, believing that the compensation offered by the city did not account for the increased value and prospects for their property due to the planned ballpark, appealed from the statement of compensation filed by the city. The trial court sustained the appeal, increasing the amount of compensation by approximately $3 million and ordering the city to pay interest at the rate of 7.22 percent. The city appeals from that judgment, claiming that the trial court (1) improperly valued the property on the basis of an unreasonable assumption that the defendants would assemble their parcels with adjoining properties owned by the city for commercial development, and (2) exceeded its authority under General Statutes \u00a7 37-3c in its award of interest. We disagree with the city's first claim but agree with its second claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The record reveals the following facts, found by the trial court or otherwise undisputed. The property is located in an area north of the downtown area of the city (north downtown) and is comprised of fourteen tax lots that form three distinct parcels, each of irregular shape and covering only part of a city block (collectively, property). For purposes of this case, the property has been designated as Parcels A, B, and C.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Parcel A\n   is located directly across from the Dunkin Donuts Park minor league baseball stadium (ballpark) on Main Street, constructed after the taking at issue. Parcel B is located two blocks south of the ballpark on the corner of Ann Uccello and Chapel Streets. Parcel C is located diagonally across from the ballpark on the corner of Main and Pleasant Streets. Collectively, the property is 2.89 acres. Prior to the taking, the three parcels were being used as parking lots. The parcels are situated in areas of north downtown that were zoned as either B-1 or B-2, the most permissive zoning categories in the city, permitting commercial and multifamily uses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   North downtown, due to its separation from the core downtown area by Interstate 84 (I-84), has historically become a separate entity from the downtown. It largely did not benefit from increased commercial development that took place starting in the late 1990s that transformed and reenergized the core downtown. Prior to and continuing through the time of the taking, north downtown contained many rundown and/or abandoned buildings and lots, as well as large, disintegrating parking areas leased by businesses on the south side of I-84 for their employees' use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Starting in 2003, the city undertook a series of efforts aimed at changing the fortunes of north downtown. In 2003 and 2004, it constructed or renovated several buildings in that area, including a Public Safety Complex, the Hartford police headquarters, and the Capitol Preparatory Magnet School. By early 2009, city officials approved a 2008 redevelopment plan with the stated goal of creating an opportunity for educational, commercial, and residential development in north downtown. The property was included in the area designated for such development. The plan called for the acquisition of properties by purchase, or eminent domain if necessary, to accomplish its development goals. In furtherance of these goals, in 2010, the city acquired a\n   parcel of land adjoining one side of Parcel A and demolished an eyesore building on it commonly known as the \"Butt Ugly\" building (Ugly lot). The city acquired other properties in the area, but definitive redevelopment plans had not yet materialized.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In July, 2012, a financially distressed seller sold the property under a single deed for approximately $374,000 to the defendant CBV Parking Hartford, LLC, a subsidiary of CBV Parking Holding, LLC (CBV). The sale was not an arm's-length transaction, and the sale price was well under the city's valuation for purposes of property tax assessment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Pennock J. Yeatman, the sole owner of CBV, is an experienced investor and developer of real estate. Prior to the purchase of the property, Yeatman had reviewed the city's 2008 plan and researched any impediment to redevelopment of the property. After he obtained the property, Yeatman took several steps to facilitate the sale or redevelopment of the property. He divided the property into three parcels to make the option of individual sales readily available, executing conveyances so that each of the three defendant subsidiaries of CBV held one. See footnote 1 of this opinion. He also negotiated the elimination of \"gangway\" rights or easements,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   which he viewed as a potential obstacle to assemblage of the property with adjoining properties. CBV's business plan identified the city as \"the logical buyer\" for Parcel A, viewing the asset as a \"long-term assemblage\" with adjoining properties owned by the city for a single lot for redevelopment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   By late 2012, the city had become the owner of both of the two smaller properties that adjoined Parcel A: a LAZ parking lot on one side of Parcel A that the city had purchased in October, 2012, for $1,280,000, and the\n   Ugly lot on the other side of Parcel A that it previously had acquired and razed for a total cost of $1,225,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In May, 2013, the city offered to buy Parcels A, B, and C for $1,170,000. CBV rejected the offer, indicating that the property was considerably more valuable and that CBV had no financial or other pressures requiring immediate sale. Negotiations continued with offers and counteroffers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In the meantime and unbeknownst to CBV, the city had decided that the construction of a ballpark could be the catalyst for further redevelopment in north downtown. On July 1, 2014, the city solicited proposals for a public/private partnership for both the construction of the ballpark and the mixed-use development of its environs, including the property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   By the close of the August 1, 2014 deadline for submissions, the city had received three proposals. It selected the one prepared\n   by DoNo Hartford, LLC (DoNo), in collaboration with two other entities. DoNo's proposal presented a concept plan for a \" 'dynamic new neighborhood' \" for north downtown that included the ballpark, retail businesses, restaurants, and 600 residential units. Under the proposal, Parcels A, B, and C were to be assembled with adjoining properties for mixed-use development. The proposal indicated that DoNo had secured letters of interest for the construction of a grocery store and a brewery with a rooftop beer garden. DoNo supported its proposal with a market study, which concluded: \" 'Given the current dynamics between employment, the state of housing opportunities in outlying areas of Hartford, and the tremendous opportunity for placemaking around the ballpark, the necessary conditions are in place to redefine what it means to live downtown.... The subject site represents an opportunity to develop and deliver a [mixed-use\n   ] neighborhood at the exact inflection point of downtown redevelopment.' \"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Neither CBV nor Yeatman submitted a proposal, and the city did not solicit one from either. Yeatman claimed to have learned about the ballpark proposal from a Hartford Courant newspaper article published in July, 2014, and the request for development proposals sometime thereafter. According to Yeatman, the one month submission deadline was unusually short by industry standards, and he had inadequate time to complete a proper proposal for submission.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In August, 2014, the city's Court of Common Council approved a resolution authorizing the purchase of the property for $2.5 million, a price to which the parties had previously tentatively agreed. However, in light of the changing landscape, Yeatman countered with a proposal to sell only Parcel A to the city, which would allow the city to assemble the entire block immediately across the street from the ballpark but would allow Yeatman to develop Parcels B and C himself. The city rejected this offer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In November, 2014, the city exercised its power of eminent domain to take the entire property, filing a statement of compensation of $1,980,000 for the taking. The defendants appealed to the Superior Court, claiming that the amount of compensation was \"inadequate.\" In a trial to the court, both the city and the defendants each presented two appraisals and supporting expert testimony; all of the appraisals were based on a comparable sales methodology.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The city's appraisals valued the property at the time of the taking at $1,900,000 and $2,010,000, respectively. Both appraisals assumed continuation of the property's present use as parking lots. The court concluded that both appraisals suffered from the same \"astounding shortcoming\"; neither took into account the \"major change\" of the announced ballpark and expectations for surrounding development.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The defendants' appraisals, prepared by Michaud Company (Michaud) and J.F. Mulready Company, LLC (Mulready), valued the property at $4,810,000 and $5,220,000, respectively. The court rejected the higher Mulready appraisal, which was premised on research related to the effect that new minor league ballparks had on surrounding land values in three other cities, two in North Carolina and one in\n   Indiana. The court found that Mulready's assumption that the positive effects of those developments would similarly follow in Hartford, despite current difficulties remaining in Hartford, was \"much too enthusiastic ....\" It also concluded that \"the research ... does not support the singularly successful picture\" reflected in Mulready's valuation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The court found the Michaud appraisal of $4,810,000 the \"most persuasive.\" The court set forth the following reasons. That appraisal rejected the \"as is\" approach of the city's appraisals because they did not reflect the highest and best use of the property. The Michaud appraisal also took into account the \" 'cloud' \" of the city's eminent domain power, which could dissuade competitive buyers and in turn depress value. Significantly, with regard to highest and best use, the court noted: \"The Michaud report relies on the concept of 'assemblage,'\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   contemplating that the LAZ property and\n   the Ugly [lot] would be joined with the Main Street exposure of the ... property. Indeed, that is exactly the basis on which DoNo premised its proposal. CBV could have made this assemblage, but was not afforded the opportunity to do so. The Michaud analysis concludes that it was reasonably probable that the property would be assembled, and if the city did not take the parcel, the market would respond. CBV could have developed this property. CBV could have developed Parcels B and C, with the city obtaining [Parcel] A. CBV could have purchased the LAZ and Ugly lots. One of the things that the Mulready findings underscore is that this scenario is exactly what occurred in the three cities studied by Mulready.\" Finally, the court pointed to the per square foot price that the city had paid for the two lots adjacent to Parcel A before the ballpark was announced, which, if applied to the property, would have yielded a valuation of $3,245,298 or $5,339,933.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   In conclusion, the court sustained the defendants' appeal, holding that the fair market value of the property at the time of the taking was $4,810,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Approximately two weeks after the court issued its decision, upon the defendants' motion, the court awarded interest at a rate of 7.22 percent. The city appealed from the trial court's judgment to the Appellate Court, and we thereafter transferred the appeal to this court. See General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) ;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Practice Book \u00a7 65-1. On appeal, the city challenges both the amount of compensation and the rate at which the trial court awarded interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The city claims that the court improperly valued the property on the basis of an unreasonable assumption that the defendants would assemble the property with adjoining properties owned by the city for commercial development. In response, the defendants contend that the city's appeal is moot because it challenges only one of\n   two independent grounds that support the trial court's fair market value determination. Alternatively, they contend that, if the appeal is not dismissed as moot, the city cannot prevail on the merits because the trial court's assemblage valuation was proper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \"Mootness implicates [this] court's subject matter jurisdiction and is thus a threshold matter for us to resolve.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Burbank\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Board of Education\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4344010\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/299/833/#p839\">\n    299 Conn. 833\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 839,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20A.3d%20658\">\n    11 A.3d 658\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2011). Undoubtedly, if there exists an unchallenged, independent ground to support a decision, an appeal from that decision would be moot, as this court could not afford practical relief even if the appellant were to prevail on the issue raised on appeal. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Middlebury\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Connecticut Siting Council\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489798\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/161/537/#p54\">\n    326 Conn. 40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 54,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489798\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/161/537/#p54\">\n    161 A.3d 537\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017) ;\n   <em>\n    Doe\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Hartford Roman Catholic Diocesan Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=317%20Conn.%20357\">\n    317 Conn. 357\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 379 n.23,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=119%20A.3d%20462\">\n    119 A.3d 462\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015). We are not persuaded that such circumstances exist in the present case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The defendants contend that the trial court's valuation rested on an alternative ground that was not based on assemblage. They rely on the final paragraph of the trial court's analysis, which commences with the following sentence: \"The history of the city's taking of\n   the two properties adjoining Parcel A of the subject property is enlightening for purposes of this court's evaluation\n   <em>\n    and presents a basis for valuing the property even without application of the assemblage doctrine\n   </em>\n   .\" (Emphasis added.) The remainder of the paragraph then explains that applying the per square foot prices paid by the city for the two parcels adjacent to Parcel A to the property would have yielded valuations of $3,245,298 or $5,339,933.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Although the trial court's initial statement clearly lends support to the defendants' view, the paragraph viewed in its entirety and in context persuades us otherwise. The trial court did not adopt either of the two per square foot valuations cited, or even the mean of the two ($4,292,615.50). It did not indicate that it had weighted one of those valuations more heavily than the other, and the valuation ultimately adopted does not conform to any obvious mathematical formula. Nor did the court articulate any reason to settle on a figure closer to the valuation of one adjacent parcel than the other. Instead, adopting the defendants' view, the trial court would have had to settle on the mean of the two valuations, and added the seemingly arbitrary figure of $517,384.50 to coincidentally arrive at the exact same valuation as Michaud's valuation of $4,810,000-a valuation predicated on assemblage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   We recognize that the trial court can make an independent determination of value and fair compensation in light of all the circumstances and is not bound by the valuations or valuation methods used by the appraisers. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Bristol\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Tilcon Minerals, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3955114\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/284/55/#p74\">\n    284 Conn. 55\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 74-75,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=931%20A.2d%20237\">\n    931 A.2d 237\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2007) ;\n   <em>\n    Robinson\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Westport\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"546568\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/222/402/#p410\">\n    222 Conn. 402\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 410,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=610%20A.2d%20611\">\n    610 A.2d 611\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1992). Nonetheless, we decline to presume, in the absence of clearer evidence, that the trial court arbitrarily settled on a valuation. Accordingly, while it also is not an entirely satisfying interpretation of the final paragraph of the court's analysis,\n   the better interpretation is that the court referenced the per square foot valuations to bolster its conclusion that Michaud's valuation, predicated on assemblage, was sound. Therefore, the city's appeal challenging that valuation is not moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The question before us, therefore, is whether the trial court's adoption of Michaud's valuation was proper. The city's argument is twofold. First, it contends that\n   the trial court applied the wrong legal test because, when it assumed that the defendants would assemble the property with neighboring properties owned by the city for commercial development, it failed to consider whether assemblage would have occurred in the absence of condemnation. Second, it contends that the evidence would not support a conclusion that the proper test was met. We do not agree with either contention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The governing principles are not in dispute. The government must pay \"just compensation\" when it takes private property. U.S. Const., amend. V ; accord Conn. Const., art. I, \u00a7 11. \"The amount that constitutes just compensation is the market value of the condemned property when put to its highest and best use at the time of the taking....

To the extent that the city's view of the legal standard is colored by its concern as to the propriety of the trial court's ultimate finding of fact that this standard was met, that is a separate matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Before we examine the trial court's ultimate finding-that there was a reasonable probability of assemblage for redevelopment by an entity other than the city-it is important to make two clarifications as to the scope of the matter before us. First, the trial court's decision appears to support the defendants' view that the lion's share of the difference between Michaud's valuation and those of the city's experts arises not from assemblage but from the effect on surrounding property values of the city's plan to construct a ballpark. The city's arguments on appeal, however, are exclusively directed to the matter of assemblage.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, we have no\n   occasion in this opinion to consider\n   whether a principle articulated by some other jurisdictions, namely, that the fair market value of property taken shall not include any increase (or decrease) in the value attributable to a redevelopment project for which the property is taken, has any application to the present circumstances.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Second, it is apparent that, throughout these proceedings, the parties and the trial court operated under the assumption that the doctrine of assemblage applies irrespective of whether the properties at issue are under common ownership. In\n   <em>\n    Towpath\n   </em>\n   , this court recognized that there is a split of authority among other jurisdictions on this question but found it unnecessary to adopt a position on that issue because it had not been raised by the parties.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Towpath\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1120149\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/255/529/#p540\">\n    255 Conn. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   549 n.13,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=767%20A.2d%201169\">\n    767 A.2d 1169\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (expressly leaving question open); see also J. Sackman, supra, \u00a7 13.01 [17]. As the parties to the present case similarly have not raised this issue, we proceed under the same assumption for purposes of resolving the issues in this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Having clarified our focus in the present case, we now examine the record to ascertain whether, and to what extent, it supports the trial court's ultimate finding-that assemblage of the property with the city's properties for redevelopment by someone other than the city was reasonably probable. The city does not contend that there was no evidence to support this finding but, rather, seeks to overturn the trial court's judgment on the extraordinary standard that review of the record should engender a \"definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <em>\n    Levine\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Sterling\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6775769\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/300/521/#p535\">\n    300 Conn. 521\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 535,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20A.3d%20664\">\n    16 A.3d 664\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2011) ; see\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20A.3d%20664\">\n    id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citing alternative tests for ascertaining clear error).

We acknowledge that the defendants' expert witness, Richard A. Michaud of the Michaud Company, was not asked to elaborate on the basis of his opinion that it was reasonably probable that the market would have responded to assemble the property for redevelopment if the city had not taken the property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   He did testify unequivocally, however, that the ballpark would have sparked market interest in developing this property. This testimony was consistent with the findings in his report, which examined market conditions existing in Hartford at the time of the taking (retail, residential,\n   office) and the effect that the ballpark would have on those conditions. More important, unlike in\n   <em>\n    Towpath\n   </em>\n   , other support for this opinion existed in the record, on which the trial court was entitled to rely. See\n   <em>\n    Branford\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Santa Barbara\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5768414\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/294/785/\">\n    294 Conn. 785\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 799 n.17,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=988%20A.2d%20209\">\n    988 A.2d 209\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010) (\"[W]e did not state in [a prior case] that the evidence testified to by the experts must in isolation support a trial court's determination that there is a reasonable probability that a property would be put to its highest and best use. On the contrary, the court was entitled to consider the testimony of [the experts] in the context of all the evidence presented at trial relevant to the proposed use of the property.\" [Emphasis omitted.] ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   It is not purely speculative that someone other than the city would have used the assembled property for redevelopment. The DoNo proposal reflected its intention to effectuate such use. Its proposal expressed the view that north downtown was ripe for redevelopment. It bolstered that view with representations that it had secured letters of interest for the construction of a grocery store and a brewery in north downtown. The Mulready report prepared for the defendants confirmed that the construction of similar types of ballparks in other cities had sparked redevelopment. The fact that the trial court found the Mulready valuation too optimistic did not preclude its reliance on some of the subordinate facts on which that valuation was based. See\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Andrews\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=313%20Conn.%20266\">\n    313 Conn. 266\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 313,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=96%20A.3d%201199\">\n    96 A.3d 1199\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014) (\"[t]he trier of fact may credit part of a witness' testimony and reject other parts\" [internal quotation marks omitted] ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The record also does not reflect that it is purely speculative that only the city would have made such an assemblage. Yeatman testified that, from the outset of CBV's purchase of the property, he had viewed the property best used as assembled with adjoining properties for development. He undertook substantial measures\n   to eliminate every obstacle to assemblage. Although CBV's business plan indicated that the city was the most logical buyer to make this assemblage after the city purchased properties surrounding Parcel A,\n   that plan preceded the disclosure of the plan to construct the ballpark. Notably, once armed with the relevant information, Yeatman made clear that, even if he were to sell Parcel A to the city, he intended to develop Parcels B and C on his own. In addition, Yeatman testified that, if he had been given a fair opportunity, he \"[a]bsolutely\" would have responded to the city's request for proposals for all or part of the plan. Yeatman's failure to produce a specific plan for redevelopment can reasonably be explained by the short window of time between the disclosure of the ballpark plan and the taking of the property, and the failed negotiations during the intervening period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Moreover, the record lends strong support to the trial court's findings that Yeatman had both the expertise and the means to assemble and develop the property himself. Over Yeatman's career as a real estate investor, he had made investments for clients totaling five and one-half billion dollars. He had developed large projects across the country similar in scale and type to DoNo's proposal. Yeatman had financed the property with mortgages to afford him the option of either selling the parcels to other developers or contributing the parcels to a joint venture and being a codeveloper of them. He testified that he had secured two other investors for development of the property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   In jurisdictions in which common ownership is not required, the fact that the city owned the properties that would need to be assembled with the defendants' property would not preclude a finding that assemblage by someone other than the city was reasonably probable.

The question is whether, despite the city's ownership of the adjoining properties, assemblage by the defendants or a third party for redevelopment was a reasonable probability sufficient to affect property values. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Santa Clara\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Ogata\n   </em>\n   , supra, at 268,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20397\">\n    49 Cal.Rptr. 397\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; see also\n   <em>\n    Greystone Heights Redevelopment Corp.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Nicholas Investment Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10124813\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/500/292/#p296\">\n    500 S.W.2d 292\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 296-98 (Mo. App. 1973).\n   We conclude that the record supports the trial court's conclusion that there was such a probability. The city had no intention of retaining the properties adjoining the defendants' property. The city's properties were not intended for use by the public (i.e., a bridge, road, or hospital) but, rather, for commercial and residential development by a private developer. In its responses to questions submitted regarding its request for proposals to accomplish those development goals, the city indicated that it would be willing to consider proposals for smaller redevelopment plans that did not include the ballpark.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   We also cannot ignore the fact that the trial court supported its adoption of the Michaud assemblage valuation by the per square foot price paid by the city for the two properties abutting Parcel A. Although this factor was not an independent ground for the trial court's conclusion, it clearly bolstered that conclusion. It is noteworthy that common sense alone would suggest that Parcel A would be considerably more valuable than either of the two properties abutting it because Parcel A had substantially greater Main Street frontage, directly across the street from the ballpark site.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Finally, we recognize that, at the time of the taking, there was no certainty that the ballpark would be constructed and, if constructed, whether it would be sufficiently successful to spark the hoped for redevelopment of north downtown. However, for such integrated use to be reasonably probable in the absence of condemnation, the possibility of assemblage must only be \"considerable enough to be a practical consideration and actually to influence prices.\"\n   <em>\n    McGovern\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    New York\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3665206\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/229/363/#p372\">\n    229 U.S. 363\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 372,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3665206\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/229/363/#p372\">\n    33 S.Ct. 876\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3665206\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/229/363/#p372\">\n    57 L.Ed. 1228\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1913) ; accord\n   <em>\n    Towpath\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1120149\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/255/529/#p540\">\n    255 Conn. at 550\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=767%20A.2d%201169\">\n    767 A.2d 1169\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

According to the city, because the trial court did\n   not set an interest rate in the judgment of compensation, the defendants are entitled only to the default rate of interest provided in \u00a7 37-3c. The city further asserts that the defendants were not entitled to offer of compromise interest because, if the default rate of interest properly had been awarded, the total compensation would not have exceeded their offer of compromise. In response, the defendants characterize the award as \"postjudgment\" interest and contend that it would be absurd to expect them to litigate the proper rate of interest before the court has rendered judgment as to the fair value of the property. We agree with the city.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The following additional procedural history is relevant to this issue. The trial proceedings and all posttrial/prejudgment\n   filings focused exclusively on the fair market appraisals of the property. The defendants did not raise the issue or present evidence related to the rate of interest. The trial court rendered judgment in favor of the defendants on December 5, 2016, finding that the property was worth $2,830,000 more than the amount paid by the city at the time of the taking. The trial court's decision contained no reference to an award of interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   On December 20, 2016, the defendants filed a motion for an award of interest on the $2,830,000 from the date of the taking in 2014, through the December 5, 2016 date of judgment, citing General Statutes \u00a7 37-3a. The city opposed the motion on the grounds that (1) interest recoverable in a condemnation action is governed by \u00a7 37-3c, not \u00a7 37-3a, the latter governing interest in civil actions generally as damages for the detention of money after it becomes payable, and (2) pursuant to the terms of \u00a7 37-3c, the defendants were entitled only to the default rate of interest prescribed therein because the trial court had failed to set an interest rate in its judgment. At a hearing on the motion, the defendants conceded that \u00a7 37-3c is the controlling statute for interest in condemnation cases. Nonetheless, they argued that the court could set interest at the 10 percent rate set forth in \u00a7 37-3a as a \"reasonable and just\" interest rate under \u00a7 37-3c. To avoid an evidentiary hearing, the parties subsequently stipulated that, if the trial court were to conclude that it could set a \"reasonable and just\" interest rate after judgment had entered, then such a rate would be 7.22 percent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The trial court granted the defendants' motion for an award of interest, ordering payment of interest at a rate of 7.22 percent. As a result, the total compensation award, including interest, exceeded the defendants' offer of compromise, and they thereafter successfully\n   moved for offer of compromise interest in the amount of $457,202.22.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The issue before us raises a question of statutory construction. As such, we apply plenary review guided by settled principles of construction aimed at ascertaining legislative intent.

Section 37-3c then prescribes calculation methods premised on the \"weekly average one-year constant maturity yield of United States Treasury securities ... for the calendar week preceding the date of taking,\" with additional interest awarded if the period from the date of the taking exceeds one year. Interest accrues from the date of the taking to the date of payment. General Statutes \u00a7 37-3c.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   In our view, the statute unambiguously dictates that, when the \"judgment of compensation\" does not include a rate of interest, as in the present case, the default rate applies. There is simply no authority allowing the trial court to adopt another rate of interest. To conclude otherwise would render the second sentence of \u00a7 37-3c superfluous.
