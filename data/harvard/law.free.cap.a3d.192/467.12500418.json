Frasca and Allison D. Brant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   On appeal, the plaintiff asserts three claims: (1)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   the court committed plain error by (a) failing to consider two valuations of the property found in the appraisal report of the plaintiff's expert witness, (b) imposing an incorrect burden of proof under General Statutes \u00a7 49-14,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and (c) making comments during the hearing that demonstrated judicial bias; (2) the court abused its discretion by erroneously relying on various exhibits submitted during the deficiency judgment hearing; and (3) the court abused its discretion by denying the plaintiff's motion for a protective order in response to the defendant's notice of deposition. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The following facts and procedural history, as set forth in the court's memorandum of decision, are relevant to our consideration of this appeal. \"[The property, 83 East Middle Patent Road, Greenwich (property) ] is two acres of residential zoned property improved with a single family house built in 1750. The two acres are located within the boundaries ... of Stamford ... but for reasons not fully explained at the hearing, [the property] is entitled to receive a Greenwich ... address. Apparently, a number of properties located on East Middle Patent Road share that same distinction, being Stamford ... real property with deeds and documents recorded in the Stamford land records, but possessing a Greenwich ... address. The two defendants, then husband and wife ... executed an\n   adjustable rate note to [the plaintiff] for $1,252,000 on January 19, 2006. That note was secured by a first mortgage on [the property] recorded on the Stamford land records in volume 8410 at page 239. A loan modification agreement dated February 24, 2011, was executed in which it was agreed as of March 1, 2011, that the principal balance due was $1,270,156.98....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \"This current foreclosure action was returnable to the Superior Court, judicial district of Stamford-Norwalk at Stamford on October 7, 2014. The operative complaint was the May 14, 2015 amended complaint, which alleged nonpayment of the installment payments due on or about March 1, 2014....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \"The plaintiff's May 7, 2015 motion for summary judgment as to the defendant was granted by the court,\n   <em>\n    Mintz, J.\n   </em>\n   , on July 13, 2015. The plaintiff's July 22, 2015 motion for summary judgment as to [Brant] was granted by the court ... on August 31, 2015. The plaintiff's March 30, 2015 motion for judgment of strict foreclosure was granted by the court ... on October 19, 2015.... On October 19, 2015, a judgment of strict foreclosure entered with a law day of December 8, 2015. The law day of December 8, 2015, passed. No appeal to the Appellate Court was filed. No stay of the judgment entered. No motion to open the judgment was filed. The defendants failed to redeem by their law day. Title [of the property] therefore passed to the plaintiff ....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \"Immediately thereafter the plaintiff's instant motion for [a] deficiency judgment was filed on December 11, 2015. The motion was assigned to this court and the court conducted two days of evidentiary hearings on October 26, 2016 and March 1, 2017. At the conclusion of evidence each of the three parties represented by counsel furnished oral argument. Posthearing briefs were waived.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On April 4, 2017, the court,\n   <em>\n    Hon.

Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On appeal, the plaintiff raises three unpreserved claims for which it seeks plain error review. First, the plaintiff contends that the court committed plain error by failing to consider two valuations of the property contained in its appraisal report. Second, the plaintiff argues that the court should not have imposed a preponderance of the evidence standard but, rather, should have used a probable cause standard in determining the plaintiff's burden of proof. Third, the plaintiff claims that comments made by the court about the plaintiff's motive for seeking a deficiency judgment and about Brant's family during the hearings reveal judicial bias.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   It is well established that \"[the plain error] doctrine, codified at Practice Book \u00a7 60-5, is an extraordinary remedy used by appellate courts to rectify errors committed at trial that, although unpreserved, are of such monumental proportion that they threaten to erode our system of justice and work a serious and manifest injustice on the aggrieved party. [T]he plain error doctrine ... is not ... a rule of reviewability. It is a rule of reversibility. That is, it is a doctrine that this court invokes in order to rectify a trial court ruling that, although either not properly preserved or never raised at all in the trial court, nonetheless requires reversal of the trial court's judgment, for reasons of policy.... In addition, the plain error doctrine is reserved for truly extraordinary situations [in which] the existence of the error is so obvious that it affects the fairness and integrity of and public confidence in the judicial proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   ... Plain error is a doctrine that should be invoked sparingly.... Implicit in this very demanding standard is the notion ... that invocation of the plain error doctrine is reserved for occasions requiring the reversal of the judgment under review....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \"An appellate court addressing a claim of plain error first must determine if the error is indeed plain in the sense that it is patent [or] readily discernible on the face of a factually adequate record, [and] also ... obvious in the sense of not debatable.... This determination clearly requires a review of the plain error claim presented in light of the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \"Although a complete record and an obvious error are prerequisites for plain error review, they are not, of themselves, sufficient for its application.... [I]n addition to examining the patent nature of the error, the reviewing court must examine that error for the grievousness of its consequences in order to determine whether reversal under the plain error doctrine is appropriate. A party cannot prevail under plain error unless it has demonstrated that the failure to grant relief will result in manifest injustice....

With these principles in mind, we address each of the plaintiff's claims of plain error in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The plaintiff's first plain error claim is that the court failed, incorrectly, to consider \"additional statements\n   of\n   value\" contained in its appraisal report submitted at the hearing for a deficiency judgment. In support of this argument, the plaintiff contends that \u00a7 49-14\"does not require demonstration of the fair market value of the property as of the date of vesting with absolute scientific certainty, but rather imposes a burden on the moving party to supply sufficient facts to permit the court to make its independent determination of value as mandated by statute.\" The plaintiff asserts that the alternative approaches to valuation set forth in the appraisal report it submitted in support of its motion supplemented its final statement of value and, in combination, the statements of value contained in the appraisal report amply satisfied its burden of proof at the deficiency hearing. In response, the defendant argues that because the court found the appraisal report not credible, there was \"no reason for the court to consider any of the valuations allegedly contained therein.\" We agree with the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The following additional information is pertinent to this claim. The record reveals that the plaintiff sought a deficiency judgment against the defendants because at the time of the strict foreclosure judgment, the property was appraised at $750,000 and the plaintiff's debt was $1,425,498.13. As evidence of the property's value at the hearing on the motion for a deficiency judgment, the plaintiff submitted an appraisal from its expert witness, Allen Glucksman, a residential real estate appraiser. Glucksman conducted an appraisal of the property on December 23, 2015 (December, 2015 report), and concluded that the fair market value of the property was $725,000. The plaintiff's claim regarding \"three separate and distinct statements of value\" contained in the December, 2015 report refers to the appraiser's discussion of the sales comparison approach, which resulted in a valuation of the property at $725,000; the cost approach, which yielded a value of $846,421; and in the\n   appendix to the appraisal report, a property field card which lists a 2014 appraisal value of $894,144. Glucksman's affidavit, also attached to the appraisal report, stated, \"[i]t is my professional opinion to a reasonable degree of certainty that the value of the subject property in its present condition is $725,000.\" Glucksman testified that he could not complete the cost approach. There was no testimony regarding the 2014 property field card valuation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The defendants did not submit their own appraisal of the property. Rather, they presented their own expert witness, Taylor Beerbower, another residential real estate appraiser, who examined and gave testimony regarding Glucksman's December, 2015 report. Beerbower asserted that the report contained significant errors making it \"unreliable and inconclusive\" and confirmed that it did not provide enough evidence for the court to establish the value of the property. Beerbower noted, inter alia, that the appraisal report did not include any other antique homes as comparables, included a short sale home as a comparable, contained significant errors in the square footage calculations of some of the comparables, and overall lacked discussion in the body of the report explaining how Glucksman arrived at his appraisal value. In its decision, the court noted many of the same errors in the December, 2015 report that Beerbower highlighted in his testimony.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   It concluded that the plaintiff\n   failed to establish the fair market value by credible and accurate evidence.\n   This court previously has stated that \"[a] deficiency proceeding has a very limited purpose.... [T]he court, after hearing the party's appraisers, determines the value of the property and calculates any deficiency. This deficiency judgment procedure presumes the amount of the debt as established by the foreclosure judgment and merely provides for a hearing on the value of the property.... The deficiency hearing concerns the fair market value of the subject property as of the date title vests in the foreclosing plaintiff under [General Statutes] \u00a7 49-14.... [T]he value placed on the property by the court for the purposes of rendering judgment of strict foreclosure and setting law days [is] irrelevant to a subsequent deficiency judgment proceeding....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \"[I]mplicit in ... \u00a7 49-14 is the requirement that the party seeking a deficiency judgment satisfy her burden of proof regarding the fair market value of the property ... in particular, the requirement that the plaintiff provide the court with sufficient evidence to demonstrate that she is entitled to a deficiency judgment.... When considering a motion for a deficiency judgment, the trial court may make an independent determination as to the valuation of the property.... Our Supreme Court has held that, in a deficiency judgment proceeding, [t]he determination of [a property's] value by a court is the expression of the court's opinion aided ordinarily by the opinions of expert witnesses, and reached by weighing those opinions in light of all the circumstances in evidence bearing upon value and its own general knowledge of the elements going to establish it.... [T]he determination of the credibility of expert witnesses and the weight to be accorded their testimony is within the province of the trier of facts, who is privileged to adopt whatever testimony he reasonably believes to be credible....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \"In determining valuation pursuant to ... \u00a7 49-14, the trier, as in other areas of the law, is not bound by the opinion of the expert witnesses .... The evaluation of testimony is the sole province of the trier of fact. We do not retry the case. The conclusion of the trial court must stand unless there was an error of law or a legal or logical inconsistency with the facts found.... We will disturb the trial court's determination of valuation, therefore, only when it appears on the record before us that the court misapplied or overlooked, or gave a wrong or improper effect to, any test or consideration which it was [its] duty to regard.\" (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Brownstein\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Spilke\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4066812\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/117/761/#p765\">\n    117 Conn.

In sum, the plaintiff argues that the court committed plain error because it discussed only the $725,000 appraisal value in its decision, and did not reference the other two statements of value that were \"unchallenged\" and \"factually sufficient\" listed in the December, 2015 report. In making this argument, however, the plaintiff fails to acknowledge the court's finding that the plaintiff's appraisal report was unreliable; nor has the plaintiff demonstrated that \"the claimed error is\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   so clear\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   so harmful that a failure to reverse the judgment would result in manifest injustice.\" (Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Reville\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Reville\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=312%20Conn.%20428\">\n    312 Conn. at 468-69\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=93%20A.3d%201076\">\n    93 A.3d 1076\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

See footnote 3 of this opinion. Also, we are aware of no decisional support for the notion that a trial court should employ a lesser burden of proof than\n   the fair preponderance standard in a deficiency judgment hearing.

It is through the lens of this jurisprudence that we view the plaintiff's claims of judicial bias.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   We first address the plaintiff's assertion that the court displayed bias against it by suggesting that the plaintiff had an ulterior motive in bringing this action, which was to obtain satisfaction of its debt from Peter Brant, the defendant's former father-in-law. In support of this claim, the plaintiff cites to five pages of transcript from the October 26, 2016 hearing, which, the plaintiff claims, reveal the court's impropriety in this regard. The transcript reflects that before hearing any testimony on this date, the court asked counsel whether any efforts had been made to resolve the matter and, in that context, repeatedly referred to Peter Brant, a person of substantial financial means.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   We agree that the court's comments regarding the practical issue of whether the plaintiff could actually obtain satisfaction of any deficiency judgment from either of the named defendants are of concern because they were beyond the scope of the issues for the court's decision. We do not read these comments, however, as a demonstration of hostility toward the plaintiff's claim for a deficiency judgment. Instead, although we agree with the plaintiff that the court's many references to Peter Brant were unhelpful and a distraction, we do not view that as a manifestation of bias, but rather find\n   that they were a reflection of the court's views of the economic realities of the plaintiff's chances of collection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   As additional support for its claim of judicial bias, the plaintiff asserts that in the March 1, 2017 hearing, the court made bias-infused comments regarding whether the court could credit any payments made on the mortgage, after the debt was determined at foreclosure, against the deficiency. One reasonable reading of the transcript reveals, however, that the court was posing a hypothetical situation and not positing that any such payments had, in fact, been made.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   In their briefs, both parties ultimately agreed that the court had created a \"fictitious scenario\" during this colloquy; therefore, it is in this context that we assess the colloquy between the court and the plaintiff's counsel. We first turn to the court's comments regarding a hypothetical scenario in response to an assertion made by the plaintiff's counsel that\n   <em>\n    TD Bank, N.A.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Doran\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=162%20Conn.%20App.%20460\">\n    162 Conn.

In its principal brief, the plaintiff states that \"[t]he transcript of the hearing clearly reflects that the court has vast personal knowledge of the area in which the property is located as well as the surrounding area and market conditions. The court, instead of employing its obvious knowledge to make a determination of value of the property as required under [\u00a7] 49-14, appears to have elected to attribute an ulterior motive to [the] plaintiff's pursuit of a statutory right to seek a deficiency judgment due to its own knowledge of the property holdings and finances of [Brant's] family.\" As claimed by the plaintiff, the court's knowledge of the area is reflected in its memorandum of decision in which the court stated: \"This property is immediately adjacent to real property owned by the family of [Brant], and in this court's opinion would be a natural acquisition by the Brant family of this additional two acres.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although we agree that reference to an adjacent property not owned by either defendant was unnecessary to the court's decision, we do not read in this reference a bias against the plaintiff's quest for a deficiency judgment. Indeed, it amply reveals that the court had familiarity with the area and with Brant's family and that the court, albeit distractingly, shared this information with the parties during the hearing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   It should be noted, as well, that during the hearing,\n   the plaintiff's counsel may have in fact perceived the court's knowledge of the area in which the property is located as a benefit to the parties. In his closing argument, the plaintiff's counsel stated in regard to the court's familiarity with the property: \"That's why ... Your Honor, with your background and understanding of this particular market, was assigned this case. I think it's a benefit to all parties to have had Your Honor assigned.\"\n   In response to the plaintiff's claims of judicial bias, the defendant contends that none of the plaintiff's allegations of bias can reasonably be tied to the court's finding that the plaintiff failed to meet its burden of proof as to the value of the property. We agree. Although the court's comments regarding the Brant family and the expression of the court's knowledge of the area and property in question should not have been stated, we do not find bias in the court's many asides and digressions. In sum, a review of the hearing transcripts reveals that throughout the proceedings, the court often made lengthy anecdotal comments, engaged in tangential musings, and pondered detailed hypotheticals not relevant to the issues at hand.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Additionally, although, as noted, the court also made several comments reflecting a knowledge of the parties' immediate family which were not pertinent to the issue confronting\n   the court, we do not believe that the court's multiple, unhelpful interjections reflected a hostility toward the plaintiff's claims or against the plaintiff itself. Thus, although the transcripts of the proceedings reveal that the court offered extended asides on matters not at issue, the analysis in its memorandum of decision was thorough, well reasoned, and based on valid legal principles reasonably applied to the admissible and credible evidence presented before it. See footnote 3 of this opinion. Although we recognize that throughout the hearing the court made remarks referencing knowledge derived from extrajudicial sources, which\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   support a claim\n   of judicial bias;\n   <em>\n    Schimenti\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Schimenti\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12497368\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/186/739/#p394\">\n    181 Conn.

The defendant testified that the plaintiff ordered the January, 2006 report, which appraised the property to have a fair market value of $1,565,000 on January 9, 2006. The plaintiff argues that the January, 2006 report is irrelevant because it \"had absolutely no legal, logical, or factual relationship to the value of the property as of December 11, 2015 ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   As support, the plaintiff relies on\n   <em>\n    First Federal Bank, FSB\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Gallup\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1201424\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/51/39/#p42\">\n    51 Conn.

The value of the property at any other time is irrelevant. See id., at 42,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=719%20A.2d%20923\">\n    719 A.2d 923\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In this setting, the plaintiff's reliance on\n   <em>\n    Gallup\n   </em>\n   is misplaced. In\n   <em>\n    Gallup\n   </em>\n   , unlike the situation at hand, the trial court relied on a two year old appraisal in its valuation of the subject property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In the present case, the court wrote that it was \"merely using the [January, 2006] appraisal for two points; the dichotomy between the large value in 2006 with the change to a 54 [percent] lesser value according to [Glucksman's] [December, 2015 report] and the failure of [Glucksman] to utilize Greenwich properties for comparables.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court therefore did not utilize the\n   January, 2006 report to determine the current fair market value of the property; rather, the court made reference to the January, 2006 report as further reason to find Glucksman's appraisal an unreliable indicator of the fair market value of the property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Second, the plaintiff asserts that the court abused its discretion by improperly considering the defendants' original loan amount. Specifically, it asserts that \"the court impermissibly relied on and drew inferences from the original [loan] amount ... to determine the value of the property at the time of title vesting.\" In its decision, the court wrote: \"Of overarching consideration was the fact that [the defendants'] loan had been furnished by the plaintiff ... on January 19, 2006, in the amount of $1,252,000. Therefore, the fair market value of this real property as of January 19, 2006, had to have exceeded by some percentage of $1,252,000.... Yet it is that same entity, [the plaintiff], that is now claiming that the fair market value of the same real property is $725,000. That dichotomy demands that the appraisal opinion be examined with careful scrutiny.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The plaintiff's assertion, however, ignores the court's numerous recitals, based upon the evidence submitted during the hearing, for its conclusion that the December, 2015 report was not reliable. The court explained that it believed that the substantial errors and lack of explanation thereof, as highlighted by the defendant's expert witness, culminated in an unreliable appraisal. The court's decision does not reference the original loan amount beyond mentioning it as background information. Nor does the court rely on the original loan amount in its analysis or determine that the fair market value of the property was an amount based on the original loan amount. Accordingly, the court did not abuse its discretion in referencing the original loan amount.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Third, the plaintiff contends that the court improperly relied on appraisal reports of the property that Glucksman conducted in March, 2015 and September, 2015. The court's decision references the prior appraisal reports as a comparison to the December, 2015 report, notably highlighting discrepancies between the reports, even when the reports utilized some of the same comparable homes. Again, the court appears to have utilized the prior appraisal reports as part of its basis for determining that the plaintiff's evidence was not credible or accurate. The record does not support the plaintiff's claim that the court relied on the prior appraisal reports to determine the present value of the property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Fourth, the plaintiff claims that the court abused its discretion by \"engaging in a hypertechnical analysis\" of the comparables in the December, 2015 report and the prior appraisal reports, thereby failing to make a determination of value \"based on the other sufficient evidence\" presented. To further its argument, the plaintiff recites portions of the court's decision and statements made by the court during the hearings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   We reiterate that the determination of value \"is the expression of the court's opinion aided ordinarily by the opinions of expert witnesses, and reached by weighing those opinions in light of all the circumstances in evidence bearing upon value and its own general knowledge of the elements going to establish it.... [T]he determination of the credibility of expert witnesses and the weight to be accorded their testimony is within the province of the trier of facts, who is privileged to adopt whatever testimony he reasonably believes to be credible.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Brownstein\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Spilke\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4066812\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/117/761/#p765\">\n    117 Conn.

Furthermore, when we review claims for an abuse of discretion, \"the question is not whether any one of us, had we been sitting as the trial judge, would have exercised our discretion differently....

We also agree that a trial court is\n   <em>\n    not required\n   </em>\n   to make a fair market value determination if it does not find the evidence presented at the deficiency judgment hearing credible or reliable. Within this parameter, the defendant presented ample evidence for the court, in the exercise of its discretion, to determine that the plaintiff failed to satisfy its burden of demonstrating the fair market value of the property as of the date title vested in the plaintiff. Accordingly, we cannot conclude that the court abused its discretion in utilizing the prior appraisal reports, or examining the December, 2015 report in detail, to weigh against the opinion of the plaintiff's expert. Because ultimately it was the plaintiff's burden to demonstrate the fair market value of the subject property in a deficiency judgment, the court's decision to find no credible valuation on the basis of the plaintiff's failure to meet this burden was within the reasonable bounds of its discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Lastly, the plaintiff claims that the court abused its discretion by denying the plaintiff's motion for a protective order in response to the defendant's notice of deposition. \" Practice Book \u00a7 13-5 provides in relevant part: Upon motion by a party from whom discovery is sought, and for good cause shown, the judicial authority may make any order which justice requires to protect a party from annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or expense, including one or more of the following\n   ... that the discovery may be had only on specified terms ....\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Coss\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Steward\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5734037\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/126/30/#p46\">\n    126 Conn.

The record is unclear as to whether a deposition was actually conducted. On February 14, 2017, the defendant filed a motion for continuance, stating that the deposition was stayed and \"cannot be rescheduled prior to [the] hearing date.\" That motion was denied on the same day, with the court instructing that \"[t]he deposition must be completed before the hearing ....\" During the March 1, 2017 hearing, the court remarked: \"I have heard nothing about any deposition completed or not completed. There's no motion. There's nothing to do with me. I don't have anything to do with that matter. That's between the two of you. I'm not asking for any status report as to any deposition or lack of deposition or anything of that nature because there's nothing before me.
