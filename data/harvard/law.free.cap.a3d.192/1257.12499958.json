Father appeals from the denial of his motion to modify legal and physical parental rights and responsibilities in the parties' son D.B. Father argues that the court improperly treated the child's maternal grandfather as a \"fictive parent\" and gave him too much weight in evaluating the statutory best-interests factors. We affirm the court's finding that changed circumstances exist, but reverse and remand its best-interests analysis for additional proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I. Procedural History\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2. We recount the procedural history in detail as it bears on the ruling at issue here. D.B. was born in January 2007. When parents divorced in November 2011, they agreed that mother would have physical rights and responsibilities in D.B. and the parties would share legal rights and responsibilities. The parenting plan contemplated that mother and D.B. would live in North Carolina. Father would have twice-weekly Skype contact with D.B., five weeks of visitation during the summer, and the parties would split other school vacations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3. Mother did not abide by the parent-child contact order, and by June 2012 father filed his first motion to enforce parent-child contact. Mother did not respond or appear at the hearing on the motion. In a February 2013 order, the court awarded father an additional week of summer contact to make up for a week of spring vacation that mother had withheld.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4. In December 2015, father filed a second motion to enforce. Again, mother did not appear at a hearing on the motion. In June 2016, the court found that mother had withheld four weeks of visitation from father, including D.B.'s 2015 spring vacation, his two-week 2015 Christmas vacation, and his 2016 spring vacation. Mother consistently withheld father's twice-weekly Skype contact as well. The court expanded father's 2016 and 2017 summer visits to seven weeks and ordered mother to abide by the Skype contact. The court directed mother to turn D.B. over to father on July 9, 2016 for his summer visit and ordered her to facilitate Skype contact. Mother was advised that her failure to comply could lead to contempt proceedings. A sheriff served mother a copy of the court's order. Nonetheless, when father went to retrieve D.B. on the arranged date, mother and D.B. were nowhere to be found. Father was forced to return to Vermont without the child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5. In July 2016, father filed a third motion to enforce and a motion for contempt; he also moved to modify parental rights and responsibilities. Mother did not appear at the hearing on father's motions. In a September 2016 order, the court found mother in contempt. It found that mother willfully violated court-ordered visitation in April 2015, December 2015, April 2016, and July 2016. It made more extensive findings on the record. Based on the evidence presented at the hearing, the court found that it was no longer in D.B.'s best interests to remain in mother's custody. Effective September 24, 2016, it transferred legal and physical custody of D.B. to father and it ordered mother to turn D.B. over to father. The court scheduled a hearing on October 3, 2016, to discuss mother's visitation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6. Notwithstanding the court's order, mother did not turn D.B. over to father. Mother initially told father's attorney that D.B. was away for the weekend. Mother did not appear for the October 3 hearing and made an excuse for her absence that the court did not find credible. In an October 2016 ruling, the court found that mother failed to abide by its orders or purge herself of prior contempts. It issued a separate arrest warrant requiring that mother be brought before the court as soon as she was found. The court asked North Carolina authorities to give its order full faith and credit and to turn D.B. over to his legal custodian. A North Carolina court subsequently issued an order for expedited enforcement of a foreign child custody order,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and mother finally turned D.B. over\n   to father on October 18, 2016. At that point, father had not seen D.B. for fourteen months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 7. Counsel for mother entered a notice of appearance on October 31, 2016, and in November 2016 mother requested parent-child contact. The court later clarified that its transfer of custody to father in September 2016 had been on a temporary interim basis based on mother's failure to facilitate visitation with father and her willingness to ignore court orders to thwart father's visitation. While the court had heard limited testimony to ensure that father could safely and adequately provide for D.B., it did not at that time have any basis for comparison to the environment that mother provided. The court thus scheduled an evidentiary hearing on what custody arrangement was in D.B.'s best interests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   II. Ruling on Motion to Modify\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 8. Following a hearing, the court issued a September 2017 order concluding that it was in D.B.'s best interests that mother have primary physical custody. It made the following findings. Father works as a software engineer. He shares a house with two roommates. D.B. has friends in the neighborhood and at school. He sees his paternal grandparents at least once a week. D.B. was doing well in school and he easily managed the transition back to Vermont. Father does not have a driver's license and his activities with D.B. were more restricted than D.B.'s activities in North Carolina.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 9. While D.B. was living with mother, mother did not communicate information about him to father. She has never abided by the Skype time ordered. She ignored father's texts and calls and threw away a birthday card that father had sent to D.B., causing D.B. to believe that father was ignoring him. The court recited detailed evidence showing that father repeatedly asked for contact, visitation, and information about D.B. and mother ignored him, made excuses why D.B. was not available, and tried to alter contact dates. Mother treated father's contact with D.B. as a nuisance, which she would occasionally grant if father begged enough and if it was convenient. Mother also interfered with father's ability to obtain medical information about D.B. and refused to provide father with D.B.'s health insurance information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 10. When D.B. returned to Vermont, mother ignored father's attempts to set up regular communication with D.B. Despite mother's behavior, father was very good at ensuring that mother and D.B. communicated. During this time, mother sent messages to D.B. intimating that his home was with her and suggesting that she was trying to \"rescue him\" from Vermont. Mother also told D.B. that she was going to put surveillance tracking on his iPad so that she would know that it was really him talking. While mother denied doing these things at the hearing, the court did not find her credible. The court found that mother clearly had boundary issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 11. D.B.'s maternal grandfather is an opthamologist and surgeon, and the court found that \"he frankly tip[ped] the balance\" in this case. The court found little positive to say about mother's parenting other than that she loved D.B. Grandfather, however, provided mother with a job and a nice house in a nice neighborhood. The court found that grandfather was \"really D.B.'s fictive parent in North Carolina.\" Grandfather took D.B. to most of his activities and often participated in these activities with D.B. D.B. often spent the night at grandparents' house or their summer house. D.B. enjoyed a higher standard of living, better housing, and was engaged in more activities in North Carolina than in Vermont. The court noted that all of this would evaporate if something happened to grandfather or if mother became estranged from him. Mother\n   had apparently hidden father's attempts to contact D.B. from grandfather. She did not tell grandfather about the court's orders. Grandfather thought father was ignoring D.B. Grandfather first learned otherwise when a warrant issued for mother's arrest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 12. Mother is engaged to a new partner with whom she had been living for two years at the time of the hearing. Mother and her partner have two young children. D.B. benefited from the partner's presence. Like grandfather, the partner did not know that mother was denying visits to father and avoiding contact with father.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 13. The court found that mother had an indescribable flat affect during the hearing, and her testimony was monotone and not credible. The court questioned whether mother had been diagnosed with any mental health issues. The testimony indicated that mother had seen the same therapist for thirteen years and that she had been diagnosed with ADD/ADHD and suffered panic attacks, and that she experienced some post-partum depression. The court stated its belief that there was more going on than what it had been told.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 14. The court determined that mother engaged in a calculating and knowing attempt to thwart visitation and that D.B. was harmed by her actions. Nonetheless, it concluded that the statutory best-interests factors narrowly favored mother having physical custody of D.B. and \"only due to [grandfather]'s presence in D.B.'s life.\" Turning to the specific best-interests factors, the court found that both parents could provide D.B. with love and affection and guidance and each adequately provided him food, clothing, medical care, a safe environment, and other material needs. Mother alone would not do as well as father in providing for D.B.'s developmental needs. When in North Carolina, however, mother \"delegate[d] this to her father ... who does an outstanding job.\" D.B. did well in school and in his community in both North Carolina and Vermont. Mother had demonstrated her inability to support contact with father. Father, on the other hand, encouraged mother to be in contact with D.B.'s school and therapists in Vermont. He was diligent in ensuring that mother communicated with D.B. Mother had been D.B.'s primary parent for most of his life; father had done a good job since D.B. arrived in Vermont. D.B. has a good relationship with father's parents in Vermont. The court's decision, however, \"turn[ed] on [D.B.'s] relationship with ... his maternal grandfather.\" Grandfather appeared to occupy most of D.B.'s nonschool time with enriching activities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 15. The court acknowledged that its decision had been \"an extremely close call.\" It reiterated that its conclusion was based on grandfather's involvement with D.B. as well as its belief that going forward, mother would support father's contact with D.B. The court stated that it would \"not touch\" the joint legal rights and responsibilities that the parties had originally agreed to, observing that it would be difficult for the parties to share custody even if they were not 1000 miles apart. Father appealed from this order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   III. Analysis\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 16. At the outset, we note that no party challenges the court's finding that there had been a real, substantial change in circumstances, and we affirm this portion of the court's ruling. Father focuses on the court's best-interests analysis. He argues that mother should not have been awarded physical custody given her alienating and contemptuous behavior and her delegation of parenting responsibilities to grandfather. He contends that the court placed too much weight on grandfather in evaluating the statutory best-interests factors, and its order improperly elevated grandfather over him, thereby interfering with his constitutional right to parent D.B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Father also asserts that the court erred by failing to address his request for primary legal parental rights and responsibilities given the breakdown of communication between the parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 17. We agree that the court erred. While the court has broad discretion in evaluating the statutory best-interests factors,\n   <em>\n    Maurer v. Maurer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3363041\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/178/489/\">\n    2005 VT 26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 10,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3363041\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/178/489/\">\n    178 Vt. 489\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3363041\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/178/489/\">\n    872 A.2d 326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (mem.), its approach here was unfair and inconsistent with the plain language of 15 V.S.A. \u00a7 665(b). The court also failed to fairly account for mother's egregious behavior toward father and explain the basis for its belief that mother's behavior would change going forward. We conclude that the court abused its discretion, and we therefore reverse and remand for additional proceedings. See\n   <em>\n    Cooter &amp; Gell v. Hartmarx Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12123482\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/496/384/#p405\">\n    496 U.S. 384\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 405,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12123482\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/496/384/#p405\">\n    110 S.Ct. 2447\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12123482\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/496/384/#p405\">\n    110 L.Ed.2d 359\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1990) (stating that abuse of discretion exists where a ruling based \"on an erroneous view of the law or on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 18. In a contested custody case such as this one, the court must compare parent to parent.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   We recognized this in\n   <em>\n    Miles v.

In that case, pursuant to the parties' agreement, a grandmother was providing the actual care for a child, although the father had nominal custody. At the mother's request, the court modified its order to award custody to mother. We affirmed its decision on appeal. We found it \"apparent that the real issue determined by the court below was whether the mother or the grandmother should have the actual and active custody of the boy,\" but we emphasized that \"the grandmother is actually a third person to this marriage relationship.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2378428\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/121/491/#p495\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2378428\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/121/491/#p495\">\n    . at 495\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2378428\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/121/491/#p495\">\n    160 A.2d at 761\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"As between a mother and a third party,\" we explained, \"the mother must prevail in a custody case, in the absence of compelling reasons to the contrary which are not present here.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2378428\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/121/491/#p495\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2378428\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/121/491/#p495\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n   When the attributes of the father and mother were compared, the court's findings supported the award of custody to the mother.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 19.

See\n   <em>\n    Paquette v.

Certainly, the\n   <em>\n    Miles\n   </em>\n   Court recognized that the grandmother played an\n   important role in the child's life; indeed, she had been the child's primary caregiver for seven years, beginning when the child was eighteen months old.

The statutory best-interests factors echo this holding, and most of the factors expressly require a parent-to-parent comparison. See\n   <em>\n    Harris v. Harris\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4779885\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/149/410/#p417\">\n    149 Vt. 410\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 417-18,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4779885\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/149/410/#p417\">\n    546 A.2d 208\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 213-14 (1988) (noting that \"[a]lmost all the [statutory] factors begin with some variation of the words 'the ability and disposition of each parent to,' \" and concluding that 15 V.S.A. \u00a7 665\"requires each parent to show his or her relationship with the child in light of the statutory factors,\" rather than simply showing that other parent is inadequate, thereby ensuring \"more balanced and complete analysis\" required by statute). Most factors focus on each\n   <em>\n    parent\n   </em>\n   's ability to accomplish certain things on behalf of their child. Thus, the court must consider \"the ability and disposition of each\n   <em>\n    parent\n   </em>\n   to meet the child's present and future developmental needs,\" and \"the relationship of the child with each\n   <em>\n    parent\n   </em>\n   and the ability and disposition of each\n   <em>\n    parent\n   </em>\n   to provide the child with love, affection, and guidance.\" 15 V.S.A. \u00a7 665(b)(1), (3) (emphases added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 21. Certainly, grandfather's relationship with D.B. is important and worthy of consideration. There is a separate statutory best-interests factor that specifically addresses \"the relationship of the child with any other person who may significantly affect the child.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4779885\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/149/410/#p417\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4779885\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/149/410/#p417\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n   \u00a7 665(b)(7). We agree that this can be a critical factor in assessing a child's best interests and it may tip the scales in the best-interests analysis. The court here, however, improperly allowed grandfather's relationship with D.B. to permeate other best-interests factors that are limited by their plain terms to an evaluation of\n   <em>\n    parents'\n   </em>\n   capacities. In considering \u00a7 665(b)(3), the court erred in concluding that although mother \"alone\" would not do as well as father in providing for D.B.'s developmental needs, she \"delegate[d]\" this parental responsibility to her father \"who does an outstanding job.\" The court was required to compare father to mother \"alone,\" not father to a third party.

To the contrary, while D.B. was in Vermont with father, mother continued to engage in alienating and obstructive behavior. She also repeatedly lied about her behavior during the hearing in this case and took no responsibility for her actions or the consequences of her behavior on D.B. or father. She professed not to have read a court order served on her by a sheriff or know that father was arriving in July 2016 to pick up D.B.; she denied depriving father of parent-child contact, asserting that she had to block father's calls because he was \"harassing\" her and that he should have come up with other ways to contact her; she testified that she did not feel that she had denied father parent-child contact; she led other people, including D.B., to believe that father did not want any contact; and she also believed that her communications with D.B. while he was at his father's home were appropriate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 26.

Again, mother did not argue that Vermont was an inconvenient forum, and the court thus made no ruling on this question. It is apparent, however, that at the time the court rendered its decision, significant evidence concerning D.B.'s best interests was available in Vermont, D.B. himself was living in Vermont, the Vermont court was poised to decide the issues before it expeditiously, and the Vermont court was intimately familiar with the facts and issues in the pending litigation given its many orders in this case prompted by mother's ongoing refusal to allow father to have contact with D.B.

In particular, the majority fails to give due deference to the weight the trial court assigns to the child's relationship with another person who may significantly affect the child, redefining the statutory best interests standard in the process. In addition, the majority substitutes its own assessment of mother's likely future efforts to foster a positive relationship between D.B. and father for the trial court's. For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b6 28.

With these standards in mind, I believe the majority's analysis falls short in addressing the two factors most in play in this case. First, the majority improperly faults the trial court for giving\n   <em>\n    too much\n   </em>\n   weight to the relationship between a child and any other person who may significantly affect the child, even though the trial court clearly concluded that in the circumstances of this family-with an eye on this child's best interests-this factor was dispositive. In doing so, the majority reads out the Legislature's express instruction that the court must consider the relationship between the child and other people who may significantly affect the child. 15 V.S.A. \u00a7 665(b)(7). Second, the majority concludes from its independent review of the evidence that the trial court did not give\n   <em>\n    enough\n   </em>\n   weight to mother's inability to foster a positive relationship between D.B. and father. In short, the majority would strike a different balance in this case rather than deferring to the judgment of the factfinder who had the opportunity to observe the witnesses and assess the situation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   I. The Child's Relationship with Maternal Grandfather and \u00a7 665(b)(7)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b6 32. The Legislature has included among the factors courts must consider in the best-interests analysis \"the relationship of the child with any other person who may significantly affect the child,\" 15 V.S.A. \u00a7 665(b)(7), and this Court has frequently recognized that a child's relationship with another adult associated with one of the parents-typically a partner or family member-can be a critical factor in assessing the child's best interests.

The paternal grandmother dressed the child, fed him breakfast after the father went to work, cared for him during the day until the father got home, and more often than not served the father and the child dinner. Frequently, the child slept at her house.

The majority doesn't deny that this factor may be significant, but seems to suggest that it shouldn't be\n   <em>\n    too\n   </em>\n   significant. It's hard to understand why not. The majority does not take issue with the trial court's finding that D.B. has greater opportunity for enriching activity in North Carolina, due largely to the efforts of D.B.'s maternal grandfather who spends a tremendous amount of time with D.B. In describing maternal grandfather as D.B.'s \"fictive\" parent, the trial court emphasizes the critical role grandfather plays in D.B.'s life. This is precisely the kind of relationship courts are supposed to consider and value pursuant to \u00a7 665(b)(7). In a truly child-centered best-interests analysis, the fact that D.B.'s relationship with grandfather is so central to his life would be a reason to assign more, not less, weight to this factor. I may not have assigned this factor the same weight as the trial court, but it was clearly well within its discretion in concluding that this factor weighed heavily enough to tip the balance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b6 35. The majority's reliance on a decision from 1960 addressing a very different issue, at a time before the Legislature even adopted the \u00a7 665(b) factors, is misplaced. In\n   <em>\n    Miles v. Farnsworth\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2378428\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/121/491/#p495\">\n    121 Vt. 491\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2378428\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/121/491/#p495\">\n    160 A.2d 759\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1960), a court had originally awarded custody of a minor child to his father,\n   <em>\n    subject to the condition that the child live with his paternal grandparents\n   </em>\n   . When the child was ten, the mother sought modification of custody. In affirming the trial court's change of custody to the mother, this Court considered the mother's remarriage, her new home, and her changed life circumstances, as well as the paternal grandmother's advancing age and likely inability to keep up with the needs of an active ten-year-old.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2378428\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/121/491/#p495\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2378428\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/121/491/#p495\">\n    . at 494-95\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2378428\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/121/491/#p495\">\n    160 A.2d at 761\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

After discussing the grandmother's aging, and its effect on her ability to continue to parent the child, the Court said that while \"the real issue determined by the court below was whether the mother or the grandmother should have the actual and active custody of the boy,\" the grandmother was actually \"a third person to this marriage relationship.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2378428\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/121/491/#p495\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2378428\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/121/491/#p495\">\n    . at 495\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2378428\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/121/491/#p495\">\n    160 A.2d at 761\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Comparing the mother to the father, the court awarded custody to the mother.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b6 36. This case is inapplicable here for three reasons. First and foremost, in\n   <em>\n    Miles\n   </em>\n   the grandmother had been acting as the child's primary care provider for years with only nominal participation by the father,\n   and pursuant to a court order designed to ensure that the child lived with her, despite the nominal award of custody to father (grandmother's son). In that context, the Court's statement that the relevant comparison should be between mother and father, and that as between mother and paternal grandmother mother must prevail, made sense. The Court was\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   suggesting that the grandmother's significant role in the child's life should not be considered in that balance, but was recognizing that in that case, the father really had no significant parental role. In this case, by contrast, grandfather is clearly a central-perhaps the most important-adult figure in D.B's life, but mother has her own home and, as the trial court expressly found, has been D.B.'s primary parent for most of his life. There is no basis in this case to conclude that mother is only \"nominally\" seeking parental rights and responsibilities while grandfather is the actual primary parent. Mother may rely heavily on grandfather to provide significant parenting support-just like the father in\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   , above-but, as the trial court found, she has acted and continues to act in a parental capacity. By invoking\n   <em>\n    Miles\n   </em>\n   in this context, the majority seems to hold that the very significant role of another adult in D.B.'s life cannot be a scale-tipping factor in the best-interests analysis;\n   <em>\n    Miles\n   </em>\n   does not support that assertion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b6 37. Second, and significantly, this case from 1960 long preceded the statute enumerating the best-interests factors-including \u00a7 665(b)(7) -that the trial court must consider in assigning parental rights and responsibilities. The\n   <em>\n    Miles\n   </em>\n   decision makes no reference to any statute; it was decided under a different framework. By using\n   <em>\n    Miles\n   </em>\n   in this way, and by suggesting that D.B.'s relationship with another adult can never tip the balance, the majority essentially eliminates \u00a7 665(b)(7) as a true factor in the best-interests analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b6 38. Third, the\n   <em>\n    Miles\n   </em>\n   Court's assessment of the weight to be afforded to the child's relationship with the grandmother was driven to a large extent by the Court's recognition that due to her age, the grandmother was not in a position to continue in the role of primary caregiver. The Court did not expressly discuss the weight to be given to the child's relationship with the grandmother, as the statute did not at the time require consideration of this factor, but its discussion makes clear that because of the grandmother's age and presumed inability to keep up with the child, his relationship with her was not due much weight.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b6 39. Nor here is the trial court's analysis undermined by its recognition that if something happens to grandfather, the balance would be different. The court was clear in its decision that the baseline expectations against which a future motion to modify parental rights and responsibilities should be assessed include grandfather's continued participation in D.B.'s life. If grandfather moves or stops engaging with D.B., that would be a changed circumstance, potentially triggering a modification of the custody arrangement under 15 V.S.A. \u00a7 668. This doesn't undermine the court's decision; it reinforces that the court thoughtfully weighed the relevant factors and concluded that, given the current state of affairs, keeping D.B. with mother, in large part so that D.B. would have the continued benefit of his relationship with grandfather, was in the child's best interests. Any time \u00a7 665(b)(7) is a factor in the best-interests analysis, the child's best interests are subject to change based on the presence of a third party. That's inherent in the factor itself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   II. \u00a7 665(b)(5) and Mother's Failure to Foster a Positive Relationship\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b6 40. The majority's scrutiny of the trial court's assessment of mother's failure to\n   foster a positive relationship with father likewise departs from the standard of review and our own recent precedent. In particular, the majority faults the trial court for its expressed hope and belief that mother's behavior in undermining D.B.'s relationship with father will change, and it asserts that the trial court's conclusion on this point is unsupported by the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \u00b6 41. The majority's approach in this case stands in stark contrast to the Court's recent opinion in\n   <em>\n    Knutsen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12453525\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/201/138/\">\n    2016 VT 2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12453525\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/201/138/\">\n    201 Vt. 138\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12453525\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/201/138/\">\n    137 A.3d 734\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In that case, the trial court found that by promoting the false belief that the mother had abused the child, the child's father and stepmother had effectively destroyed the child's formerly good relationship with his mother.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00b6\u00b6 13-14. After recounting a long history of intransigence by the father and stepmother, including their continued refusal even during the appeal before the Court to back away from their claims of abuse by the mother, the Court affirmed the trial court's continued award of parental rights and responsibilities to the father and its temporary suspension of parent-child contact with his mother.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00b6 33. The Court acknowledged that the trial court had considered the relevant statutory factors and provided a reasoned basis for its conclusions.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . Noting the mother's frustration at the father's failure to cooperate in facilitating any contact between her and the child, this Court wrote, \"We note that mother is not without recourse should father and stepmother continue to interfere with her attempts at reunification or should they defy the trial court's orders.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00b6 34. In addition to deferring to the factfinder's assessment concerning the child's best interests, the majority was willing to support the trial court's hope, despite its own skepticism, that\n   <em>\n    this time\n   </em>\n   the father and stepmother would be sufficiently chastened by the court's admonition that they would comply with its order to take specified steps to facilitate the child's reunification with his mother.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   \u00b6 42. In this case, by contrast, the trial court had ample basis to believe that the future would not mirror the past. The trial court observed that mother's partner and grandfather, apparently the two most influential adults in her life, had been unaware of her prior misbehavior vis-a-vis father. The court clearly had confidence that they would hold mother's feet to the fire. Moreover, the court made it clear to all parties that if mother did not change her ways, the court would reassign parental rights and responsibilities. By conducting its own review of the record to reach a contrary conclusion, the majority has failed to afford the trial court the deference it is due. Although the majority may have weighed the evidence differently, the trial court's expectation that mother would improve her conduct had ample support in the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \u00b6 43. For the above reasons, I would affirm the trial court's decision.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    Even the weight to be afforded the \"primary care provider\" factor, which we have frequently identified as the most important, is largely within the discretion of the trial court. See, e.g.,\n    <em>\n     Habecker v. Giard\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2196315\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/175/489/\">\n     2003 VT 18\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , \u00b6 14,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2196315\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/175/489/\">\n     175 Vt. 489\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2196315\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/175/489/\">\n     820 A.2d 215\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (mem.) (recognizing that \"a primary care provider finding is entitled to great weight,\" but noting that \"the weight accorded to [this] factor depends upon the quality of the relationship between the child and custodian, as well as the likely effect that a change of custodian will have on the child\").\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
