We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following factual findings, which are not challenged, and procedural history are relevant to our consideration of the issues raised on appeal. Zoey was born on May 9, 2015. Because her mother, M, was homeless and exhibited behavior that raised concerns about her ability to care for Zoey,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   the petitioner sought and was granted an ex parte order of temporary custody, thereby removing Zoey from M's custody. Zoey was placed in a nonrelative foster home, where she remained up to and through the hearing that resulted in the judgment at issue in this appeal. On September 23, 2015, following a hearing, and with M's admission, the court adjudicated Zoey to be uncared for and committed Zoey to the custody of the petitioner. The man that M identified as Zoey's father, who appeared at the hearing, stood silent with respect to the adjudication. Thereafter, genetic testing established that he was not Zoey's biological\n   father, and on October 13, 2015, he was dismissed from the case. After Zoey's commitment, M engaged in some sporadic mental health services, but soon stopped taking advantage of such services and began to deny the need for further treatment. In March, 2016, the respondent came forward and moved to be cited into the case, asserting that he was Zoey's actual father; the court added him as a party. Genetic testing confirmed that the respondent was Zoey's biological father, and, on May 19, 2016, the court adjudicated him as such.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On May 6, 2016, before the results of genetic testing were submitted to the court, the respondent filed a motion to revoke Zoey's commitment to the petitioner. The motion was supported by M, who did not seek revocation and custody herself. The petitioner filed an objection to the respondent's motion to revoke commitment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The court scheduled a review of the matter for June 20, 2016, at which time the respondent was presented with specific steps that had been drafted by the Department of Children and Families (department) to aid with his reunification with Zoey. The respondent refused to sign the specific steps after objecting to some of them, including undergoing a substance abuse evaluation and a mental health evaluation. Nevertheless, the respondent did agree to visits with Zoey, supervised by All Pointe, LLC, and he agreed to attend psychotherapy at the Yale Child Study Center. The court, over the respondent's objection, accepted all of the specific steps recommended by the department and, on June 20, 2016, made them orders of the court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On July 14, 2016, the court held a hearing on the respondent's motion to revoke commitment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   After considering the evidence presented and the arguments\n   advanced, the court denied the respondent's motion. The court commended the respondent for coming forward and for being proactive. It held, however, that the respondent had failed to put forth a prima facie case that would permit the court to revoke Zoey's commitment. The court explained that it would not be in Zoey's best interest for her commitment to be revoked, but that with psychotherapy to assist the respondent with recognizing Zoey's particular needs, and some assistance with creating a better bond with Zoey, the respondent, after continued supervised visitation and psychotherapy sessions, might be successful in reunification. The respondent did not appeal from that July 14, 2016 judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Instead, the respondent continued to engage in supervised visitation with Zoey and actually began some of the services set forth in the specific steps ordered by the court. In particular, in September, 2016, the respondent attended his first appointment at the parent-child psychotherapy program at the Yale Child Study Center. The respondent was discharged from the program one month later when he failed to attend his next scheduled appointment and did not return calls or text messages from the center. Similarly, the respondent attended the first of ten parenting classes through All Pointe, LLC, but never completed another class.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On June 8, 2017, nearly one year after the denial of his first motion to revoke commitment, the respondent filed a second motion to revoke commitment. The court held a hearing on the motion on August 30, October 10 and October 26, 2017, at which the respondent argued that he had done everything necessary to secure reunification with Zoey. The petitioner argued that the respondent had failed to comply with the specific steps that the court had ordered, that he did not have a good understanding of Zoey's needs, that he did not have a sufficient bond with her because he failed to attend\n   the parent-child therapy as ordered, and that he had engaged in concerning behavior during some of his visits with Zoey.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In a very thorough October 31, 2017 memorandum of decision, the court found that the respondent failed to comply with\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   of the court-ordered specific steps, with the exception of supervised visitation. The court also credited the respondent's testimony that he would not abide by any court orders until he obtained custody of Zoey, and that he would \"not participate in recommended services that were ordered by [the] court in order to meet Zoey's needs prior to reunification.\" The\n   court discussed the respondent's unwillingness to heed the recommendations of medical professionals, and it concluded that the respondent \"show[ed] a lack of regard for Zoey's needs ... putting his need to be sole decision maker regarding Zoey's diet ... before Zoey's health.\" The court further found that the respondent was unwilling to communicate with Zoey's foster parents because, in the words of the respondent, \"they come from two different worlds and have nothing in common. They have a nanny and he does not. He further stated that there is nothing they can tell him about his own child.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The court also discussed the respondent's inability to recognize safety issues concerning Zoey. It commented on the respondent's testimony that, despite M's unaddressed mental health issues, he would permit her to visit with Zoey whenever she wanted to visit. The court also commented on the respondent's aggression and outbursts at the Boys and Girls Village, which caused Zoey to exhibit fear during several visits that were conducted there. The court credited the testimony of a department social worker, Renata Tecza, that the reason the department was insisting that the respondent undergo a mental health evaluation was because his\n   \"anger 'rises to a different level,' and this is a concern for Zoey's safety going forward.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On the basis of this and other evidence, the court denied the respondent's motion to revoke commitment, finding that \"the preponderance of the evidence shows that the [respondent's] failure to comply with his specific steps impacted his ability to meet Zoey's needs both medically and emotionally. This failure also has had an impact upon his ability to keep her safe.\" This appeal followed. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The respondent claims that his right to procedural due process under the United States constitution was violated by the court's failure to hold an adjudicative hearing to determine his fitness as a parent before infringing on his right to the custody and care of his biological child. Insofar as this claim may not have been preserved properly, he requests review pursuant to\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"566558\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/213/233/#p239\">\n    213 Conn. 233\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 239-40,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=567%20A.2d%20823\">\n    567 A.2d 823\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1989). The petitioner argues that the respondent's claim is not only unpreserved, but that it is unreviewable because the respondent is attempting to attack the original judgment that adjudicated Zoey uncared for and committed her to the petitioner's custody. She contends that the respondent did not request an adjudicative hearing and that he should have filed a motion to open the original judgment on the basis of mutual mistake regarding paternity as soon as he was added as a party to this case and determined to be Zoey's biological father. She argues: \"He cannot now, after having twice lost at trial on motions to revoke commitment, argue that the original judgment was defective because he didn't have the opportunity to participate in the dispositional hearing that led to Zoey ... being committed.\" We conclude that the respondent's claim is reviewable\n   under\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   , but that the claim fails to satisfy\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   's third prong because the court did not violate the respondent's right to procedural due process when it denied his motion to revoke commitment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Under\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   , \"a [respondent] can prevail on a claim of constitutional error not preserved at trial only if all of the following conditions are met: (1) the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error; (2) the claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right; (3) the alleged constitutional violation ... exists and ... deprived\n   the [respondent] of a fair trial; and (4) if subject to harmless error analysis, the [petitioner] has failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the alleged constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt. In the absence of any one of these conditions, the [respondent's] claim will fail.\" (Emphasis omitted; footnote omitted.)\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=567%20A.2d%20823\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; see\n   <em>\n    In re Yasiel R.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=317%20Conn.%20773\">\n    317 Conn. 773\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 781,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=120%20A.3d%201188\">\n    120 A.3d 1188\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015) (modifying third prong of\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   by eliminating word \"clearly\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The respondent's claim meets the first two prongs of\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   and, therefore, is reviewable. As to the first prong, as is conceded in the petitioner's appellate brief, the record is clear that the respondent did not receive the type of hearing to which he now claims he was constitutionally entitled, a hearing in which the petitioner would have the burden of proving that the respondent was not fit to have custody of Zoey. As to the second prong, the respondent is claiming a violation of his procedural due process rights in the custody and care of his biological child. We conclude, therefore, that the claim is reviewable. We conclude, however, that the respondent's claim fails to satisfy the third prong of\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   because the alleged constitutional violation does not exist.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Whether the lack of an adjudicative hearing at which the petitioner bore the burden of proving that the\n   respondent was unfit to have custody of Zoey deprived the respondent of procedural due process is a question of law as to which our review is plenary.

In fact, M had declared another man to be Zoey's father, and he was named in the case, although he had not acknowledged paternity. At a later hearing on September 23, 2015, the state amended the ground of the petition to allege only that Zoey was uncared for because M was homeless.

Under the facts and circumstances of this case, we conclude that the process afforded the respondent in response to his motion to revoke commitment was constitutionally sufficient in light of Zoey's already having been adjudicated uncared for and placed in the petitioner's custody for her protection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   As previously stated in this opinion, at the time the petitioner filed a neglect petition, Zoey was days old. M identified another man as Zoey's father. At a hearing on September 23, 2015, the petitioner, with\n   the agreement of M, amended the ground of the neglect petition to allege only that Zoey was uncared for. M admitted that allegation while the putative father stated that he would stand silent. The court then adjudicated Zoey uncared for and ordered her committed to the care and custody of the petitioner by agreement of the parties, thus properly proceeding with the two phases, adjudication and disposition, required by \u00a7 46b-129 (j) (2).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   See\n   <em>\n    In re Joseph W.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=305%20Conn.%20633\">\n    305 Conn. 633\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 643,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=46%20A.3d%2059\">\n    46 A.3d 59\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012). In the September 23, 2015 hearing, the petitioner\n   bore the burden of proving that Zoey was uncared for, which she clearly met. The next phase of the hearing was the dispositional phase at which the court determined which of the \u00a7 46b-129 (j) (2) dispositional options was in the best interest of Zoey\n   <em>\n    at that time\n   </em>\n   . Clearly, in this case, at the time of the September 23, 2015 hearing, placement with the petitioner was in Zoey's best interest; her mother was homeless, her purported father did not acknowledge paternity and was incarcerated, and neither of them proposed another option. On these facts, the court properly adjudicated Zoey uncared for and ordered her committed to the care and custody of the petitioner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Approximately six months later, in March, 2016, the respondent appeared, asserting that he was Zoey's biological father. On May 6, 2016, the respondent filed a motion to revoke commitment on the ground that he was \"ready, willing, and able to care for his child,\" that recent paternity tests revealed him to be Zoey's biological father, and that it was not in Zoey's best interest to be committed to the care and custody of the petitioner. The court received the results of the genetic testing on May 19, 2016, and adjudicated the respondent to be Zoey's father. This adjudication of parentage took place when Zoey was more than one year old, and eight months after she had been adjudicated uncared for and committed to the care and custody of the petitioner, in whose custody she had been since she was days old. Eventually, the court denied the respondent's motion to revoke commitment, and the respondent did not appeal from that judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   On June 8, 2017, when Zoey was more than two years old, and approximately twenty-one months after the court adjudicated her uncared for and ordered her committed to the care and custody of the petitioner, the respondent filed a second motion to revoke commitment, on the same grounds set forth in his first motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The court denied that motion on October 31, 2017. The denial of this motion is the subject of the present appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   A motion to revoke commitment is governed by \u00a7 46b-129 (m) and Practice Book\n   \u00a7 35a-14A. Section 46b-129 (m) provides: \"The commissioner, a parent or the child's attorney may file a motion to revoke a commitment, and, upon finding that cause for commitment no longer exists, and that such revocation is in the best interests of such child or youth, the court may revoke the commitment of such child or youth. No such motion shall be filed more often than once every six months.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Practice Book \u00a7 35a-14A provides: \"Where a child or youth is committed to the custody of the commissioner ... the commissioner, a parent or the child's attorney may file a motion seeking revocation of commitment. The judicial authority may revoke commitment if a cause for commitment no longer exists and it is in the best interests of the child or youth. Whether to revoke the commitment is a dispositional question,\n   <em>\n    based on the prior adjudication\n   </em>\n   , and the judicial authority shall determine whether to revoke the commitment upon a fair preponderance of the evidence. The party seeking revocation of commitment has the burden of proof that no cause for commitment exists. If the burden is met, the party opposing the revocation has the burden of proof that revocation would not be in the best interests of the child. If a motion for revocation is denied, a new motion shall not be filed by the movant until at least six months have elapsed from the date of the filing of the prior motion unless waived by the judicial authority.\" (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Pursuant to \u00a7 46b-129 (m) and Practice Book \u00a7 35a-14A, the moving party bears the burden of proving that a cause for commitment no longer exists; if he or she is successful, the court then must determine whether revocation of commitment is in the best interest of the\n   child. In the present case, the respondent contends that it was a violation of his procedural due process right for the court to place the burden on him to establish that no cause for commitment existed. He argues that the court, instead, should have held an adjudicative hearing wherein it presumed he was a fit parent, and, unless the petitioner could establish otherwise, he, essentially, automatically would get custody of this child, despite the fact that she already had been adjudicated uncared for and her custody had been transferred to the petitioner. We disagree with the respondent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Zoey was born in May, 2015, and adjudicated uncared for in September, 2015, and committed to the care and custody of the petitioner. The motion to revoke commitment from which the respondent now appeals was filed on June 8, 2017, when Zoey was more than two years old and nearly two years after Zoey's adjudication and commitment. The record indicates that Zoey did not know the respondent for the first year of her life. Similarly, at the time he filed his first motion to revoke commitment, the respondent knew little or nothing about Zoey, other than that he might be her biological father. He had no idea about her medical, social or psychological needs. He was, for all practical purposes, a stranger to Zoey. The respondent did not challenge on appeal the court's denial of his first motion to revoke commitment. Instead, he initially made efforts to comply with some of the specific steps ordered by the court in connection with the first motion, and he participated in supervised visitation with Zoey. Thus, by the time of the hearing on the respondent's second motion to revoke commitment, the court had available to it substantial evidence of the respondent's interactions with Zoey and his efforts to prepare himself to take custody of a child who had spent virtually her entire life in the petitioner's custody. The evidence was presented to the court in a three day hearing that involved numerous\n   witnesses. The court rendered a detailed opinion on the basis of that evidence and concluded that a cause for commitment\n   still existed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   A necessary predicate to this conclusion is the court's determination that the respondent was not fit, at that time, to care for Zoey. On the basis of the record before us, we are confident that the procedure afforded the respondent satisfied the second prong of\n   <em>\n    Mathews\n   </em>\n   . The procedures in place did not pose an inappropriate risk of an\n   <em>\n    erroneous deprivation\n   </em>\n   of the respondent's interest in the care and custody of his child, and the alternative procedural \"safeguard\" now advocated by the respondent was not appropriate under the facts and procedural posture of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   As for the third\n   <em>\n    Mathews\n   </em>\n   factor, \"the [g]overnment's interest, including the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or substitute procedural requirement would entail\";\n   <em>\n    Mathews\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Eldridge\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12026449\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/424/319/#p335\">\n    424 U.S. at 335\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12026449\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/424/319/#p335\">\n    96 S.Ct. 893\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; we conclude that the additional or substitute procedural requirement for which the respondent advocates-namely, an adjudicative hearing wherein he is presumed to be a fit parent, and, unless the petitioner could establish otherwise, he, essentially, automatically would get custody of this child, despite the fact that the child\n   <em>\n    already had been adjudicated uncared for\n   </em>\n   and custody had been given to the petitioner for her protection-simply is inappropriate, unwarranted, and ill-advised under the facts and circumstances of this case, regardless of any fiscal and administrative burdens that such a procedure would entail. The petitioner has a substantial interest in ensuring the well-being of children that have been placed in\n   her custody. Although the respondent's desire to take custody of and care for Zoey is admirable, it does not justify the creation of a process that would require the court to turn over a child who, properly and without contest, has been adjudicated uncared for to a person who does not know anything about the child or her needs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Balancing the three\n   <em>\n    Mathews\n   </em>\n   factors, we conclude that the respondent has not established that his right to procedural due process was violated by the lack of an adjudicatory hearing, in response to his motion to revoke commitment, wherein he would be presumed to be a fit parent for Zoey, a child adjudicated uncared for by the Superior Court almost two years earlier. We conclude that the procedures set forth in \u00a7 46b-129 (m) and Practice Book \u00a7 35a-14A strike the appropriate balance between the petitioner's and the respondent's interests, and comply with the constitution's procedural due process requirements. Accordingly, there is no procedural due process violation under the facts of this case, and, therefore, the respondent's claim fails under\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   's third prong.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The respondent next claims, \"as applied to the respondent father in this case ... \u00a7 46b-129 (m) violates his substantive due process right to custody and care of his child.\" He argues that he \"has a substantive due process right to the custody and care for his child that may not be infringed unless he has been adjudicated to be an unfit parent, or a trial court has found that granting his motion to revoke commitment would present a risk of imminent harm to the child.\" He also argues that the court improperly placed the burden of proof on him and thereby failed to provide adequate protection for his fundamental right. We are not persuaded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Insofar as the claim is unpreserved, the respondent requests\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   review.\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"566558\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/213/233/#p239\">\n    213 Conn. at 239-40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=567%20A.2d%20823\">\n    567 A.2d 823\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As with the respondent's procedural due process claim, he meets the first two prongs of\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   and, therefore, this claim is subject to review.

That aspect of the case is important, for there is a presumption that fit parents act in the best interests of their children.... Accordingly, so long as a parent adequately cares for his or her children (i.e., is fit), there will\n   normally be no reason for the State to inject itself into the private realm of the family to further question the ability of that parent to make the best decisions concerning the rearing of that parent's\n   children.\" (Citation omitted; emphasis omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) He also argues that our Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Roth\n   </em>\n   specifically held that the state may infringe on a parent's fundamental right to the care and custody of his children \"only when it can be demonstrated that there is a compelling need to protect the child from harm.\"\n   <em>\n    Roth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Weston\n   </em>\n   , supra, 259 Conn. at 229,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=789%20A.2d%20431\">\n    789 A.2d 431\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   We wholeheartedly agree with these statements of the law as quoted by the respondent.

Both cases involved the constitutionality, as applied to the facts of the specific cases, of state statutes that permitted courts to interfere with a custodial parent's decision regarding a third party's right to compel visitation with their child or children.

Although\n   we recognize that at the time of this adjudication, another man was alleged to have been Zoey's father, and the respondent was not a party to the case, it does not change the historical fact that Zoey had been adjudicated an uncared for child, who was in need of the petitioner's protection and intervention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   In applying the burden to the respondent to prove that a cause for commitment no longer existed, in response to his motion to revoke commitment, the court properly applied the law and did not violate the respondent's right to substantive due process. The respondent was not entitled to a presumption of fitness\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   his daughter already had been adjudicated uncared for and committed to the care and custody of the petitioner. Furthermore, there\n   <em>\n    was\n   </em>\n   a compelling reason to protect Zoey from harm; she was uncared for when she was merely days old, and this resulted in such an adjudication. As we previously explained in part I of this opinion, Zoey was adjudicated uncared for in September, 2015, and committed to the care and custody of the petitioner, who had been granted custody of her when she was days old. The motion from which the respondent now appeals was filed on June 8, 2017, nearly two years after Zoey's adjudication and commitment. In such an instance, the constitution does not require that the court presume that the respondent is a fit parent, acting in the best interest of his child, when the court is considering the merits of his motion to revoke his daughter's commitment, which commitment was made after the Superior Court adjudicated the child uncared for. In\n   <em>\n    Troxel\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Roth\n   </em>\n   , the courts found that the parents' substantive due process rights were violated because\n   the statutes at issue in those cases permitted interference with the parents' right to make decisions for their children, without the states being required to demonstrate a compelling need that warranted such interference. That is not the case here.\n   The state, virtually since Zoey's birth, has had the custody and responsibility to care for her. Thus, the respondent is seeking to\n   <em>\n    acquire\n   </em>\n   custody of Zoey from the petitioner following Zoey's commitment; he is not seeking to prevent interference with an existing and ongoing parent/child relationship. He has never had custody of Zoey; the petitioner has had custody since Zoey was days old. Indeed, at the time of her commitment to the petitioner, the respondent was not known to be her father. When Zoey was found to be uncared for, the respondent was not in her life providing for her care. These factual distinctions are important. Furthermore, the state's interest in protecting the well-being of Zoey, an uncared for child for whom it has been responsible for since the child's birth, is much greater than was the state's interest in\n   <em>\n    Troxel\n   </em>\n   and in\n   <em>\n    Roth\n   </em>\n   . Based on the facts of this case, we conclude that the court's application of \u00a7 46b-129 (m) did not infringe on the respondent's right to substantive due process. Accordingly, the respondent's claim fails under\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   's third prong.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   In this opinion the other judges concurred.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    The attorney for the minor child has submitted a statement, pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 67-13, adopting the petitioner's brief.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    M has been diagnosed as having personality disorders.

Rather, our statutes focus on the status of the child, at the adjudicatory phase, regardless of who or what may have caused that status. See\n    <em>\n     In re David L.\n    </em>\n    , supra, at 191,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=733%20A.2d%20897\">\n     733 A.2d 897\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ; General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 46b-120 and 46b-129 (j). The respondent's contention that a new adjudicatory hearing was required to determine \"whether he has ever abused, neglected, or abandoned the child\" fails to recognize that our statutory scheme does not require a finding of parental fault. Zoey was adjudicated uncared for in September, 2015, before the respondent had stepped forward claiming to be her father. That is a\n    <em>\n     historical fact\n    </em>\n    ;\n    <em>\n     she was uncared for\n    </em>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    Furthermore, the facts in\n    <em>\n     In re Sanders\n    </em>\n    are materially different from those in the present case. In\n    <em>\n     In re Sanders\n    </em>\n    , the respondent father was known at the time the mother was adjudicated unfit, and, for a period of time, he had custody of the children. Nevertheless, the petitioner, the Michigan Department of Human Services, avoided a hearing on the father's fitness simply by dismissing the abuse and neglect claims against the father.\n    <em>\n     In re Sanders\n    </em>\n    , supra,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4293668\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mich/495/394/#p400\">\n     495 Mich. at 403\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=852%20N.W.2d%20524\">\n     852 N.W.2d 524\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Under Michigan's statutory scheme, this apparently allowed the petitioner to move to the dispositional phase and switch the burden of proof to the father. As set forth previously, though, that is not the procedural posture of this case. Zoey was adjudicated uncared for before the respondent even was known to be her father; he did not have custody of her, and there is no indication he was involved in her life at all. In addition, relying on\n    <em>\n     Stanley\n    </em>\n    , the Michigan Supreme Court in\n    <em>\n     In re Sanders\n    </em>\n    held that the father's \"right to direct the care, custody, and control of his children is a fundamental right that cannot be infringed without\n    <em>\n     some\n    </em>\n    type of fitness hearing.\" (Emphasis in original.)

The court then conducted an analysis under\n    <em>\n     Mathews\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Eldridge\n    </em>\n    , supra,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12026449\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/424/319/#p335\">\n     424 U.S. at 319\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12026449\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/424/319/#p335\">\n     96 S.Ct. 893\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , to determine whether a hearing at the dispositional phase, after one parent has been adjudicated neglected, satisfies the constitution's due process requirements. We have applied that same analysis to the proceeding on the respondent's motion to revoke commitment in light of the very different facts of this case. Given the differences in the nature of the proceedings in the two cases and the materially different facts, we conclude that the Michigan Supreme Court's conclusion in\n    <em>\n     In re Sanders\n    </em>\n    is inapposite to the present case.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    Finally, it is also significant that during oral argument, the respondent conceded that if we were to agree with his one-parent argument, we would have to reverse\n    <em>\n     In re David L.\n    </em>\n    The respondent, however, did not request an en banc hearing of this court. \"[I]t is axiomatic that one panel of this court cannot overrule the precedent established by a previous panel's holding.... This court often has stated that this court's policy dictates that one panel should not, on its own, reverse the ruling of a previous panel. The reversal may be accomplished only if the appeal is heard en banc.\" (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n    <em>\n     State\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Carlos P.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489409\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/157/723/\">\n     171 Conn.
