We reverse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   After suffering seizures, Santino Michael Leo was admitted to HUMC on April 30, 2011. While in HUMC's pediatric intensive care unit (PICU), it was determined he had an airborne infection, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, and pneumonia. He developed acute respiratory distress, multiple organ failure and sepsis, and passed away on May 13, 2011.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In July 2012, plaintiffs filed a wrongful death and survivorship medical malpractice complaint against HUMC, the child's treating physicians, Dr. Bruce Friedman, Dr. Stephen Percy, and Dr. Mark Siegel,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and fictitiously-named physicians, nurses and other HUMC staff. At the time of the malpractice alleged in the complaint, each of the named physicians was board certified in pediatrics and in pediatric critical care.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In support of their complaint, plaintiffs filed affidavits of merit (AOM) from Dr. Howard Eigen, and Alisha Wursten, R.N., B.S.N. In his AOM, Dr. Eigen states he is a licensed physician in the state of Indiana, \"board certified and credentialed by a hospital for\n   at least five years in the [sub]specialties of pediatric pulmonology and critical care\" and, \"[d]uring the year immediately preceding the date of the occurrence that is the basis of the claim or action, ... devoted a majority of [his] professional time to the active clinical practice of pediatric pulmonology and critical care.\" Dr. Eigen subsequently provided three reports opining as to the alleged deviations from the standard of care by Drs. Friedman, Percy and Siegel, and other HUMC personnel,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the manner in which the deviations proximately caused the child's death. The parties waived the\n   <em>\n    Ferreira\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   conference.\n   Almost three years later, Dr. Eigen testified during his March 2015 deposition that he was board certified in pediatrics and in the subspecialty of pediatric critical care, and in 2011 was credentialed at the Riley Hospital for Children to practice pediatric and pediatric critical care medicine. He also testified that from 2006 through 2011, he served as the medical director of the hospital's PICU, and was on call approximately ten weeks per year providing care to the PICU patients. When he was not on call, Dr. Eigen administered the PICU and served as the vice-chairman of pediatrics for clinical affairs. Dr. Eigen testified that between 2006 and\n   2011 he devoted twenty-five percent of his time to direct patient care in the PICU, fifty percent to administrative duties and twenty-five percent to seeing outpatients and teaching residents in the outpatient clinics.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Drs. Friedman, Percy and Siegel moved for summary judgment, arguing plaintiffs lacked proof they deviated from the requisite standard of care because Dr. Eigen was not qualified to testify as an expert under the New Jersey Medical Care Access and Responsibility and Patients First Act, N.J.S.A. 2A:53A-37 to -42. The physicians claimed Dr. Eigen was not qualified to testify because he did not devote the majority of his professional time to clinical practice during the year preceding the alleged malpractice in 2011, and therefore did not satisfy the requirements of N.J.S.A. 2A:53A-41(a)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In its written opinion, the court noted the physicians' summary judgment motions presented the following issue: \"whether [p]lainiffs' proffered expert[, Dr. Eigen,] is qualified as an expert under N.J.S.A. 2A:53A-41(a)(1) or N.J.S.A. 2A:53A-41(a)(2) as required under\n   <em>\n    Nicholas v. Mynster\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4157907\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/213/463/\">\n    213 N.J. 463\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4157907\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/213/463/\">\n    64 A.3d 536\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013).\" The court determined that although Dr. Eigen is board certified in pediatrics and pediatric critical care, he did not satisfy the requirements of either N.J.S.A. 2A:53A-41(a)(2)(a) or N.J.S.A. 2A:53A-41(a)(2)(b), \"which require either devotion to practice or the teaching requirement mandated for a board certified expert.\" The court concluded Dr. Eigen did not satisfy the statutory requirements because he \"only devoted a small percentage of his practice time to pediatric critical care in the year prior to the date of the alleged malpractice[.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In separate orders dated September 22, 2015, the court barred Dr. Eigen's testimony against Drs. Siegel and Friedman, and granted summary judgment in their favor, and barred Dr. Eigen's testimony against Dr. Percy. Two weeks later, the court entered an order granting Dr. Percy summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In October 2015, plaintiffs moved for an order permitting Dr. Eigen to testify as to the standard of care and causation against\n   HUMC. Plaintiffs argued the court's order barring Dr. Eigen's testimony as to the defendant physicians under the Patients First Act did not preclude him from testifying as an expert against HUMC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   After hearing argument, the court denied the motion in a December 11, 2015 order. In its written opinion, the court noted plaintiffs' liability claims against HUMC were premised on the hospital's alleged vicarious liability for the negligence of the defendant physicians, who the court found were \"employees of\" HUMC. The court reasoned that its prior disqualification of Dr. Eigen as an expert against the physicians precluded his testimony against the hospital, and found it could not \"allow [p]laintiff[s] to bootstrap into evidence the excluded testimony of [the] dismissed\n   defendant doctors['] deviation [from] the standard of care under the circumstances.\" The court determined that plaintiffs could not use Dr. Eigen's testimony to support their claim HUMC is liable due to the defendant physicians' deviation from the standard of care because Dr. Eigen was not qualified to testify concerning the physicians' alleged negligence under the Patients First Act. The court concluded Dr. Eigen was not permitted to testify as to HUMC's alleged deviation from the standard of care \"because it would violate the rule of N.J.S.A. 2A:53A-41(a)\n   <em>\n    et. seq.\n   </em>\n   \"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Plaintiffs filed a motion to correct the court's December 11, 2015 order to permit Dr. Eigen to offer proximate causation testimony as to HUMC.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   In a February 11, 2016 order, the court denied the motion. In its written opinion, the court found Dr. Eigen's proximate causation testimony would be \"unduly prejudicial under the circumstances of this case\" because he \"disavowed\" offering standard of care opinions as to HUMC in his reports and deposition. In addition, the court found that permitting Dr. Eigen to testify about proximate causation would be unduly prejudicial to HUMC because the court's order barring his testimony as to the defendant\n   physicians would necessarily preclude HUMC from cross-examining Dr. Eigen about the physicians' alleged deviations from the standard of care.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On February 17, 2016, HUMC moved for summary judgment claiming plaintiffs lacked expert testimony establishing proximate causation. Plaintiffs cross-moved to allow late service of an expert report from Dr. Emily Dawson and substitution of Dr. Dawson for Dr. Eigen as their expert. Plaintiffs argued that late submission of the report should be permitted because they could not have anticipated what they characterized as the court's \"novel\" rulings barring Dr. Eigen's testimony, and because Dr. Eigen retired and was no longer available.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On June 3, 2016, the court denied plaintiffs' cross-motion, finding their need for a new expert was the result of their failure to comply with N.J.S.A. 2A:53A-41, and their request was made too late - a year and a half after the discovery end date and following seven scheduled trial dates. The court granted HUMC's summary judgment motion, finding plaintiffs lacked an expert on proximate cause that was essential to their malpractice claim. On July 8, 2016, the court denied plaintiffs' motion for reconsideration of its June 3, 2016 orders. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Plaintiffs do not appeal the orders barring Dr. Eigen's testimony as to the physicians or granting the physicians' summary judgment motions. Instead, plaintiffs challenge the December 11, 2015 order barring Dr. Eigen from testifying as to the standard of care and proximate cause as to HUMC, the February 11, 2016 order barring Dr. Eigen from testifying as to proximate cause as to HUMC, the June 3, 2016 orders granting HUMC summary judgment and denying plaintiffs' cross-motion permitting the late filing of a new expert report, and the July 8, 2016 order denying their motion for reconsideration. In its brief on appeal, plaintiffs make clear they do \"not seek reversal of any of the [o]rders as to any of the individual doctors and only seek[ ] to reinstate the claim against HUMC.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Plaintiffs present the following arguments for our consideration:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   POINT I\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   THE MOTION COURT IMPROPERLY BARRED THE TESTIMONY OF PLAINTIFFS' EXPERT UNDER THE RELEVANT STATUTES WHICH ARE APPLICABLE ONLY TO PHYSICIANS, NOT TO HOSPITALS.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   POINT II\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   BECAUSE DR.

We therefore first consider whether the court correctly determined Dr. Eigen was not qualified to testify as an expert under the Patients First Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \"[W]e apply ...

The record does not support HUMC's contention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   During his deposition, Dr. Eigen was asked directly if his reports included an opinion that HUMC \"and its nurses or personnel departed from the applicable standard of care of a hospital.\" He incorrectly stated his reports did not include such an opinion,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   and agreed, subject to a caveat,\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   that he did not express an opinion concerning HUMC's deviation from the standard of care.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Dr. Eigen was not similarly asked if he had an opinion on proximate causation, and our review of the portion of the transcript from his deposition provided by HUMC makes clear he never disavowed offering an opinion on proximate cause.
