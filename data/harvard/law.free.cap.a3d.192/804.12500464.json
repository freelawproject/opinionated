The court thereafter sentenced Thaniel to life imprisonment for first-degree murder and consecutive terms of thirty years for attempted second-degree murder and twenty years for use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence. A panel of this Court affirmed his convictions on direct appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    Thaniel v. State\n   </em>\n   , No. 1374, September Term, 2005 (filed Sept. 25, 2007),\n   <em>\n    cert. denied\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=402%20Md.%20354\">\n    402 Md. 354\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=936%20A.2d%20851\">\n    936 A.2d 851\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2007).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Thaniel subsequently filed a postconviction petition, raising claims of ineffective assistance of both trial and appellate counsel. The postconviction court granted his petition and ordered a new trial. The State thereafter filed an application for leave to appeal, which we granted and transferred the case to our appellate docket. The State now raises the following questions for our consideration:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   I. Whether the postconviction court erred in concluding that trial counsel was ineffective in agreeing to close the courtroom during jury selection;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   II. Whether the postconviction court erred in concluding that trial counsel was ineffective in failing to object when the trial court and counsel addressed a note from the jury in Thaniel's absence;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   III. Whether the postconviction court erred in concluding that appellate counsel was ineffective in failing to raise on appeal an unpreserved claim that the trial court\n   erred in addressing a note from the jury in Thaniel's absence; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   IV. Whether the postconviction court erred in concluding that the cumulative effect of trial counsel's alleged errors warranted postconviction relief.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   We find merit in the State's contentions and shall vacate the postconviction court's order but remand, because the State has not challenged one of the postconviction court's rulings, by which it found that trial counsel had been ineffective in failing to file motions to modify sentence and for sentence review by a three-judge panel. Because that ruling stands, we shall direct that the postconviction court issue an order permitting Thaniel to file belated motions to modify sentence and for sentence review by a three-judge panel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On February 6, 2004, Shawn \"Peanut\" Boston was driving his car through East Baltimore, accompanied by Catherine Jones, the mother of his son.\n   <em>\n    Thaniel v. State\n   </em>\n   , No. 1374, September Term, 2005, slip op. at 3, 4-5. At approximately 9:00 p.m., while they were stopped at a traffic light, Thaniel entered the vehicle and sat in the rear seat.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2, 5. \"As they turned onto Eager Street, near her grandmother's residence, [Thaniel] said 'Man, you know what's up. Kick that shit out.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5. Boston muttered, \"Aw, shit,\" stopped the car, took an item from beneath his seat, and handed it to Thaniel.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Thaniel then said, \"this was for my man E,\" and, in Jones's words, \"started shooting\" Boston and Jones.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Boston died from \"multiple gunshot wounds.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3. Ms. Jones survived but was seriously injured and endured an extensive hospital stay. When police detectives first attempted to interview her about the shooting, seventeen days afterwards, she \"could mouth words, but she could not talk.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   She stated, at that time, that \"she had not seen the shooter and that no one else\" had been in the car with her, besides Boston.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   She further stated that she was \"scared and wanted protection.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-4. Ultimately, Jones decided to\n   cooperate with the police, having decided that Thaniel \"shouldn't get away with this because he tried to take my life, and he took my son's father['s] life.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   There were two other witnesses to the shooting, Latisha Privette and Jerome Wiggs. Privette had been a passenger in Wiggs's car on the night of the shooting.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. As they turned onto Eager Street, she observed a man exiting the back of a vehicle and \"shooting through\" the driver's\n   side window of the vehicle as he did so.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Although she could not see the shooter's face, she described him as \"tall and dark skinned,\" wearing a ski cap, \"with a thick build.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   &amp; n.4. Privette called 911 and told the operator what she had seen.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Wiggs also observed the man shooting through the driver's side window of Boston's car. He described the shooter as wearing \"baggy clothes\" and a skull cap and \"estimated that he [had] heard 'at least ten shots.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Wiggs stated that he then \"got the hell out of there.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In addition to the two eyewitnesses to the crime, a third person, Quante Bell, an acquaintance of Thaniel and Jones, gave a statement to police. In April of 2004, several months after Boston's murder, Bell had been arrested in an unrelated case. While being interrogated, he told Baltimore City Police Detective Raymond W. Laslett, the lead detective in the Boston case, that he had been privy to a conversation between his brother and Thaniel. According to Bell, Thaniel had told Bell's brother that he had shot Boston in the chest. (Later, at Thaniel's trial, Bell would disavow his statement, which was then introduced into evidence as a prior inconsistent statement.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In June of 2004, a grand jury returned two indictments, charging Thaniel with a variety of offenses related to the February 6th shooting. The first indictment charged Thaniel with first-degree murder of Shawn Boston; use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of a felony or violence; and wearing, carrying, or transporting a handgun. The second charged him with attempted first- and second-degree murder\n   of Catherine Jones; first- and second-degree assault of the same victim; use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of a felony or violence; and wearing, carrying, or transporting a handgun. In June of 2005, a trial was held on those charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   As jury selection was about to begin, the following exchange, which forms the basis for one of Thaniel's ineffective assistance claims, took place:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   [Trial counsel had just been excused from being in the courtroom momentarily while the bailiff arranged for the venire to enter the courtroom.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   THE CLERK: When you do this selection should I have all of them wait outside? We're going to use all 85 chairs.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   THE COURT: Oh, you mean for the -- when we select the jury?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   THE CLERK: Yeah.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   THE COURT: Are they -- are we going to need -- are we going to require all -- all the spaces in the courtroom?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   THE CLERK: To get them close up as possible so they [will] be able to hear their number.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   THE COURT: Well, they -- I can't clear the courtroom for jury selection. I'm not allowed to do that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   THE CLERK: Oh, okay.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   THE COURT: So I would suggest -- Mr. [prosecutor], and, Mr. [trial counsel], could you approach for a second again, please?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   THE CLERK: Mr. [trial counsel]?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   THE COURT: Mr. [trial counsel], could you approach for a minute, please?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   (Counsel and the defendant approached the bench, and the following ensued:)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   THE COURT: Okay.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   The clerk's expressed some concern that there may be not enough room for all the -- especially the way the people are spread out now. Now, I -- I'm assuming that there are\n   some people here on behalf of the defendant and there's some people here on behalf of the victim.\n   [TRIAL COUNSEL]: I don't know, Your Honor. I told my people yesterday, anticipating this problem, that nothing really of consequence is going to happen until the afternoon. So I'm not sure --\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   THE COURT: Do we have -- do you have people here that you recognize?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   [TRIAL COUNSEL]: Anybody there?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   THE COURT: People on behalf of the defendant?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   [TRIAL COUNSEL]: Huh?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   THE DEFENDANT: Yes. (Inaudible).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   [TRIAL COUNSEL]: Yeah.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   THE COURT: He heard that. Present in the courtroom? Well, what I would suggest -- I don't know who's who. I mean,\n   <strong>\n    I was going to have everybody move to one section but I don't want people who are at enmity with one another sitting next to each other.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   [THE STATE]:\n   <strong>\n    Right. I don't think that would be a good idea.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   THE COURT: So, --\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   [TRIAL COUNSEL]: I --\n   <strong>\n    I don't care if you send them outside, Judge. Because there's no room.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   THE COURT:\n   <strong>\n    I can't on my motion clear the courtroom.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   [TRIAL COUNSEL]: I was going to ask that -- them to step out.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   THE COURT: During jury selection?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   [TRIAL COUNSEL]: Yes. Just because I figured that you --\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   THE COURT: I'll do -- I'll do it. But can I do that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   [TRIAL COUNSEL]: I'll do it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   THE COURT: Is it -- is it --\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   THE CLERK: We usually do it, Your Honor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   THE COURT:\n   <strong>\n    Does that in any way violate the defendant's constitutional rights?\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   THE CLERK: No. We -- we usually do it when we have a large panel. We have (inaudible).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   THE COURT: Yeah. You're all agreeing that it's not going to violate his rights for a public trial --\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   [THE STATE]: Well, I can only deal with --\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   [TRIAL COUNSEL]:\n   <strong>\n    We have no objection. We have no objection.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   THE COURT: All right. Fine. I'll just ask them if they just could just step outside while we select the jury.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   In fact, I might as well just excuse them until this afternoon because that's all we're going to do this morning.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   THE COURT: All right. Ladies and Gentlemen, who -- those of you who are here as spectators in this case, I'm going to ask you, and this based upon an agreement between the State's Attorney and the defense attorney, to step outside.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   The reason why I'm asking you to do this is because we have a large number of jurors coming over here to select a jury from, and I can't have -- I can't -- it's improper to leave the spectators and the jurors mixed up together in the -- in the audience of the courtroom.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   So I'm going to ask you if you would please leave. And the -- we're not going to actually start the trial in this case, the actual trial until this afternoon. So we're not going to be actually doing anything other than jury selection between now and two o'clock.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   So I am going to ask you, if you're not a witness in this case, to please leave the courtroom. And you're certainly welcome to come back at two o'clock and witness the trial.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   Thank you very much.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Jury selection proceeded in the closed courtroom. Afterwards, the courtroom was reopened, as promised, and trial proceeded for three days.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   After three hours of deliberation, the jury sent two notes to the trial judge, notes 3 and 4, which are the subject of another of Thaniel's postconviction claims. A bench conference ensued between the judge and counsel for both sides, out of Thaniel's presence:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   THE COURT: I have two questions here. One [note 3] is simply that the jurors want to -- it says, \"We the jury respectfully request that all trial attendees be held in the courtroom until we have had an opportunity to vacate the building, and give us ample time to make it to our transportation.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   And every single juror (inaudible).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   [TRIAL COUNSEL]: Right. Yeah, okay.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   [THE STATE]:\n   <strong>\n    I heard there were some issues.\n   </strong>\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   THE COURT:\n   <strong>\n    Oh, there were. There was a lot of tension here.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   And then also [note 4] they have reached a verdict in the first count. They want to know whether -- well, I can't show it to you. I've never had this happen before. They've actually reached a verdict of guilty on the first count. They want to know whether they have to go on to the second count.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   [TRIAL COUNSEL]: (Inaudible).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   THE COURT: They want to know whether they need to reach a verdict on second degree. Which they really don't, because it merges.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   [TRIAL COUNSEL]: Right. Right.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   THE COURT: But the thing that I'm not sure of is whether they've reached a verdict on the other count -- the other charges which were submitted. And I have to find that out.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   Let me just tell you this. I am not going to do this right now. I'm going to take a luncheon recess,\n   <strong>\n    give everybody a chance to, you know, prepare.\n   </strong>\n   And then we'll take the verdict at 2:00 -- do --\n   [TRIAL COUNSEL]:\n   <strong>\n    Prepare for what?\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   THE COURT:\n   <strong>\n    Prepare for what's going to happen when the verdict is announced.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   [TRIAL COUNSEL]: All right.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   THE COURT:\n   <strong>\n    I mean I don't want to put anybody in danger here.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   [TRIAL COUNSEL]: No, I understand. But why's it going to be better? I just want -- I just want to get it over with quite frankly.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   THE COURT: Well, I know you do.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   [TRIAL COUNSEL]: When's -- when's -- when's it going to be better at?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   THE COURT: Because the --\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   [TRIAL COUNSEL]: -- better after lunch?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   THE COURT: Because -- well, I just feel more comfortable doing it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   [TRIAL COUNSEL]: Judge?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n   THE COURT: I have to -- the Sheriff --\n   <strong>\n    the Sheriff needs to be made aware of all of this. They need to be prepared.\n   </strong>\n   I'm sorry. But that's what I'm going to do.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Further discussion ensued concerning the appropriate response to the jury's question about the form of the verdict. The court then recessed for lunch, at 12:30 p.m., intending for the jury to resume deliberations at 2:00 p.m., but less than half-an-hour later, the court reconvened to accept the jury's verdict. Before the jury had been brought in, the trial judge stated for the record that, given \"the security issues involved here,\" Thaniel would \"remain shackled\" while the verdict was taken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   The jury found Thaniel guilty of first-degree murder of Shawn Boston, attempted second-degree murder of Catherine Jones, first- and second-degree assault of Jones, wearing, carrying, or transporting a handgun, and use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence. It acquitted Thaniel of attempted first-degree murder of Jones. After the jury had\n   been polled and its verdict hearkened, the Sheriff escorted them out of the courtroom.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Sentencing was deferred so that a presentence investigation (\"PSI\") report could be prepared. Thaniel, as noted earlier, received the maximum sentence: an aggregate sentence of life imprisonment plus fifty years. The convictions for first- and second-degree assault of Jones and wearing, carrying, or transporting a handgun were merged for sentencing purposes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Thaniel appealed, contending that the trial court had erred in admitting into evidence Jones's identification of him as the shooter and that it had further erred in admitting into evidence the audio recording of Bell's out-of-court statement to the police. In an unreported opinion, a panel of this Court rejected both claims and affirmed.\n   <em>\n    Thaniel v. State\n   </em>\n   , No. 1374, September Term, 2005.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   In 2015, Thaniel filed a pro se postconviction petition, which was later supplemented, with the assistance of counsel. In the supplemental petition, Thaniel raised the following claims:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-103\">\n   I. Ineffective assistance of trial counsel for failing to object to the lack of a unanimous verdict;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-104\">\n   II. Ineffective assistance of trial counsel for failing to object when the trial court violated Maryland Rules 4-231(b) and 4-326(d), governing jury communications;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-105\">\n   III. Ineffective assistance of trial counsel for waiving Thaniel's right to a public trial;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-106\">\n   IV. Ineffective assistance of trial counsel for failure to file a motion for modification of sentence and an application for sentence review by a three-judge panel;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-107\">\n   V. The cumulative effect of trial counsel's errors amounted to ineffective assistance; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-108\">\n   VI. Ineffective assistance of appellate counsel for failing to raise the issues of lack of unanimous verdict and violations of the rules governing jury communications.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Following a hearing on the supplemental petition, the postconviction court granted relief as to all but the first claim and ordered that Thaniel be awarded a new trial. Regarding the\n   ineffective assistance claim related to jury communications, the postconviction court found that the juror notes at issue, notes 3 and 4, \"pertained to the action,\" under Maryland Rule 4-326(d),\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   thereby triggering Maryland Rule 4-231(b), which entitles a defendant to be \"physically present at ... every stage of the trial,\" with exceptions not relevant here.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court further found that Thaniel had not been notified by trial counsel of his right to be present while the trial court\n   addressed the issues raised in those notes. As for the fourth note, which asked whether the jury, having found Thaniel guilty of the flagship count, should consider lesser-included offenses, the postconviction court found that Thaniel had not demonstrated prejudice. As for the third note, however, which \"indicated a safety concern [by the jurors] with how courtroom attendees might react to the verdict,\" the postconviction court concluded that \"it cannot say that the State has met its burden of showing, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the violation was harmless,\" and it granted relief as to that claim.\n   Regarding Thaniel's ineffective assistance claim based upon the closure of the courtroom during voir dire, the postconviction court found that \"the total closure of the courtroom for the full day it took to conduct the voir dire process in [Thaniel's] case amounted to more than a\n   <em>\n    de minim[i]s\n   </em>\n   interference with [his] right to a public trial\" and that trial counsel's \"failure to have objected to the closure therefore deprived [Thaniel] of his right to effective assistance of counsel.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Regarding Thaniel's ineffective assistance claim based upon trial counsel's failure to file a motion for modification of sentence and an application for sentence review by a three-judge panel, the postconviction court granted relief but did not specify a remedy, presumably because it was ordering a new trial on the other claims. To the extent that the postconviction court ruled that Thaniel is entitled to relief on this claim, the State has not challenged that ruling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   As for Thaniel's claim based upon the cumulative effect of trial counsel's purported errors, the postconviction court concluded that, having found ineffective assistance as to the juror communications, the closure of the courtroom, and the failure to file post-trial motions for modification and sentence review, it found prejudice accruing from the cumulative effect of those errors. Finally, regarding Thaniel's claim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel, the postconviction court found that, because \"the issue of the jury communications was meritorious,\" appellate counsel rendered ineffective assistance in failing to raise that issue in Thaniel's direct appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   The State filed a timely application for leave to appeal, contending that the postconviction court had erred in failing to apply the analytical framework of\n   <em>\n    Strickland v.

The only significant difference between the two cases is that here, unlike in\n   <em>\n    Weaver\n   </em>\n   , there was not even deficient attorney performance, which, in that case, the lower court had found, based upon trial counsel's \"serious incompetency, inefficiency, or inattention,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1907 (citations and quotations omitted), a finding that was not contested before the Supreme Court. In contrast with\n   <em>\n    Weaver\n   </em>\n   , where trial counsel had acquiesced in the courtroom closure because of ignorance of the law, in the instant case, the trial judge and trial counsel had affirmatively agreed to the courtroom closure under circumstances suggesting that trial counsel had a tactical reason for doing so. There was evidence in the record that the reason trial counsel had agreed to the closure was, at least in part, his desire to avoid a possible outbreak of violence between spectators\n   sympathetic to his client and spectators sympathetic to the victim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   That distinction further weakens Thaniel's case in comparison with\n   <em>\n    Weaver\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Oken v.

Thaniel has failed to rebut the presumption that trial counsel had agreed to the courtroom closure as a matter of trial strategy. We hold that trial counsel did not render deficient performance, given the evidence (which was later confirmed when the verdict was taken) that he sought to avoid an in-court confrontation between the families of his client and that of the murder victim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   In any event, Thaniel, like Weaver, has presented no evidence that, but for the decision of trial counsel to agree to the closure of the courtroom during voir dire, there is a reasonable probability that the outcome of his trial would have been different, nor has he presented any evidence that that decision rendered his trial fundamentally unfair. Indeed, it appears that the postconviction court treated this claim as if it had been a preserved claim of structural error in a direct appeal. Thaniel's claim was, in fact, nothing of the sort, and his total inability to show\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   prejudice bars relief on this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   In passing, we note that Thaniel raises several arguments in support of the postconviction court's ruling, but none of them has any merit. Thaniel claims that he raised, in the postconviction court, a freestanding claim that the trial court's structural error in closing the courtroom during voir dire had violated his right to a public trial and that we should affirm the postconviction\n   court's grant of relief on that\n   ground. But he ignores that trial counsel had affirmatively waived that freestanding claim of structural error by agreeing to the closure of the courtroom, as the postconviction court correctly recognized.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Curtis v.

There is no evidence whatsoever that any specific\n   juror would have been stricken had Thaniel's family and friends been allowed in the courtroom during voir dire. As in\n   <em>\n    Weaver\n   </em>\n   , \"the courtroom remained open during the evidentiary phase of the trial,\" there were, presumably, \"many members of the venire who did not become jurors\" but had observed the proceedings, and the record indicates no \"basis for concern, other than the closure itself.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1913. As in\n   <em>\n    Weaver\n   </em>\n   , Thaniel has failed to show \"that the potential harms flowing from a courtroom closure,\" such as juror misconduct during voir dire or \"misbehavior by the prosecutor, judge, or any other party,\" had \"[come] to pass,\" and we similarly conclude that the public trial violation did not \"pervade the whole trial or lead to basic unfairness.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The purported prejudice he alleges that he suffered is purely speculative and provides no basis for vacating his convictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Whether the postconviction court erred in finding trial counsel ineffective for failing to object when the trial court and counsel addressed a juror's note in Thaniel's absence\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   The State challenges the postconviction court's conclusion that Thaniel's trial counsel was ineffective in failing to object when the trial court, in the presence of counsel for both parties, addressed a juror's note in Thaniel's absence. According to the State, the note on which the postconviction court granted relief, note 3, did\n   not pertain to the action; trial counsel properly waived Thaniel's right to be present, under Rule 4-326(d) ; and, in any event, Thaniel failed to demonstrate prejudice. As for the latter two contentions, we agree.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   The postconviction court failed, in its analysis, to account for Rule 4-231(c), which, at the time of trial, provided:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-140\">\n   (c)\n   <strong>\n    Waiver of right to be present.\n   </strong>\n   The right to be present under section (b) of this Rule is waived by a defendant:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-141\">\n   (1) who is voluntarily absent after the proceeding has commenced, whether or not informed by the court of the right to remain; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-142\">\n   (2) who engages in conduct that justifies exclusion from the courtroom; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-143\">\n   (3) who, personally or through counsel, agrees to or acquiesces in being absent.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   Clearly, trial counsel acquiesced in Thaniel's absence, as contemplated by the rule. Thaniel's presence, under those circumstances, was not subject to a knowing and voluntary waiver, as the postconviction court seemed to assume. The postconviction court failed to address the possibility that trial counsel's waiver of Thaniel's presence fell within \"the wide range of professionally competent assistance.\"\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/\">\n    466 U.S. at 690\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   Moreover, the postconviction court concluded that \"it cannot say that the State has met its burden of showing, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the violation was harmless.\" In other words, the postconviction court applied the wrong legal standard in assessing prejudice. Under the correct standard, Thaniel, not the State, bore the burden to show that, but for trial counsel's alleged error in failing to object to Thaniel's absence from the bench conference, there was a reasonable probability that the result of the trial would have been different.\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/\">\n    466 U.S. at 694\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thaniel, however, utterly failed to demonstrate any prejudice accruing from his absence from the bench conference where the note was addressed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   Thaniel, nonetheless, insists that his fundamental right to be present was violated because his trial counsel failed to notify him of the juror notes and thereby thwarted his ability to be present when the court determined its course of action in response to those notes.
