In its adjudication, the Department classified these five workers as employees, but it classified five other workers who worked there in similar positions as independent contractors. Because all ten workers were \"customarily engaged in an independently established trade, occupation, profession or business\" under Section 4(\n   <em>\n    l\n   </em>\n   )(2)(B) of the Unemployment Compensation Law (Law),\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   we reverse the Department's holding in that respect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   A Special Touch (Salon) is a sole proprietorship owned by Colleen Dorsey (Owner) that offers nail, skin, massage and cosmetic services. On August 26, 2014, the Department's Office of Unemployment Compensation Tax Services (Tax Services Office) notified Salon that it owed $10,647.93 in unemployment compensation taxes, with interest, for the period 2010 through the second quarter of 2014.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The assessment notice asserted that ten persons who worked at Salon during that period of time were employees and subject to the unemployment payroll tax. Salon petitioned for a reassessment, on which the Department conducted a hearing on January 12, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In the course of the reassessment proceeding, the Tax Services Office conceded that three of the workers had been incorrectly classified as employees. The three included one licensed cosmetologist and two others who did occasional cleaning and babysitting services. This left the status of the seven remaining workers in contest. Two worked as massage therapists; two worked as nail technicians; one did cleaning and maintenance work; one did babysitting,\n   cleaning and laundry work; and one did babysitting and cleaning work. In its adjudication, the Department concluded that the massage therapists were independent contractors and, accordingly, granted Salon's reassessment as to them. With respect to the five remaining workers, the Department acknowledged it was a \"close case.\" Department Adjudication at 33; Reproduced Record at 36a (R.R. ----). In the end, it concluded that the two nail technicians and the three who did occasional babysitting, cleaning and laundry work at the Salon were employees, not independent contractors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In reaching its conclusion, the Department made extensive findings of fact, and they are not disputed by Salon. In 1999, Owner bought the building with an operating salon on the first floor. She lives upstairs. Before Owner bought the operating salon business, it employed 10 to 15 persons, who were treated as employees for purposes of the unemployment payroll tax. Owner continued this business model until approximately 2005, when she closed down Salon. In approximately 2007, Owner reopened Salon under a \"lease the space out\" arrangement, by which the professional workers split their client payments with Salon. Sixty percent went to the professional worker, and forty percent went to Salon \"to cover items such as electric, water, credit card fees and other overhead[.]\" Department Adjudication at 3-4, Finding of Fact No. 10; R.R. 7a. Salon did not have written independent contractor agreements with any of the ten individuals whose work at Salon prompted the Department's audit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   None of the ten workers who were the subject of the audit had their names listed on the exterior of the salon. Only one worker, one of the massage therapists, had business cards. All were responsible for maintaining professional licenses, where applicable, and Salon did not provide any job training. All ten workers were free to work for others; had keys to the salon; and maintained their own schedules.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Clients scheduled their appointments for professional services at Salon by directly calling the service providers, who had given their personal phone numbers to their clients, or by calling Salon. All appointments were maintained on Salon's computer, regardless of how they were scheduled. Approximately 80% of Salon's clients had \"arrange[d] standing or regular appointments[.]\" Department Adjudication at 5, Finding of Fact No. 19; R.R. 8a. The prices for Salon services were agreed upon by both Salon and the professional workers. Salon collected the client's payments, but the professional workers maintained a record of each transaction to ensure an accurate split. Salon paid the professional workers \"by business check weekly, biweekly, or semimonthly[,]\" without any withholdings for income or other payroll taxes. Department Adjudication at 5, Finding of Fact No. 23; R.R. 8a. Clients paid tips directly to the professional worker except where the client used a credit card to pay for the service and the tip. The professional workers provided their own supplies and equipment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Prior to the period covered by the assessment, Owner \"let one person go\" because she \"did not feel that person was 'a fit for this,' and did not think 'this is the space' for that person.\" Department Adjudication at 6, Finding of Fact No. 25; R.R. 9a. Owner indicated to the Tax Services Office that she controlled who provided their services at Salon and could dismiss persons by ending their so-called lease arrangement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The two nail technicians, S.M. and V.D.,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   have their own stations at Salon. Both\n   appear on Salon's website as members of \"Our Team\" and \"Our trained and friendly staff[.]\" Department Adjudication at 12, Finding of Fact Nos. 76, 79; R.R. 15a.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   One nail technician, S.M., is Owner's sister and had worked at Salon as an employee before it closed. When it reopened, S.M. agreed to work under the new lease arrangement. S.M. works on Wednesdays, when she may see two to four clients, and sometimes on Tuesdays; she averages $200 per week in earnings. She described her work at Salon as \"a side activity - something she does [ ] to get out of the house[.]\" Department Adjudication at 12, Finding of Fact No. 74; R.R. 15a. She provides her own equipment and collects her 60% share on a semi-monthly basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The other nail technician, V.D., began working at the Salon in 2011 while also working at two other locations. Over time, she brought all her clients to Salon, which is now the only place where she performs her services. She sets her own hours and provides her own equipment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The three \"cleaning personnel\" are G.S., C.S. and B.G. Their names do not appear on Salon's website. G.S. works at an M &amp; M factory and began doing part-time janitorial work at Salon in 2013 for a couple hours a week. He sets his own hours and hourly wage, and he bills Salon for his work. C.S. is a college student and works at Red Robin; he does babysitting for Owner's children as well as cleaning and laundry duties for Salon. He works one to four days a week. He sets his hours and hourly wage, and he bills Salon for his work. B.G. worked at Salon during the third quarter of 2012 during which time she also worked at a \"temp agency[.]\" Department Adjudication at 10, Finding of Fact No. 57; R.R. 13a. She babysat Owner's children and did janitorial work. B.G. set her own hours and hourly wage, working one or two days a week, depending on need, and billed Salon for her work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Department reviewed Salon's reassessment petition under Section 4(\n   <em>\n    l\n   </em>\n   )(2)(B) of the Law, which indirectly defines self-employed persons as those who are (1) free from control or direction over the performance of their services and are (2) customarily engaged in an independently established trade or business. 43 P.S. \u00a7 753(\n   <em>\n    l\n   </em>\n   )(2)(B).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Department found that all seven workers worked free from Salon's control or direction, which satisfied the first prong. However, the Department concluded that under the second prong, two workers were independent contractors and five were employees of Salon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   With respect to the massage therapists, L.M. and C.B., the Department concluded that they were independent contractors because they provided services in other places,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , in their clients' homes. Further, L.M. had her own business cards. Because the massage therapists worked in more than one location, the Department concluded that they were engaged in an independent trade or business.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   With respect to the nail technicians and cleaning personnel, the Department found otherwise. Because none provided nail or cleaning-type services at other places, they were found not to be engaged in an independent trade. The Department also reasoned that a person is not \"customarily\" engaged in a trade or business when he performs \"isolated or sporadic jobs.\" Department Adjudication at 17 (citing\n   <em>\n    Minelli v. Unemployment Compensation Board of Review\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7314755\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/39/593/\">\n    39 A.3d 593\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Pa.

Salon then petitioned for this Court's review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    Appeal\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On appeal,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Salon argues that the Department erred in concluding that any of the five workers were its employees simply because they did not perform their services in locations other than Salon. Salon asserts that the Department erred in its reliance upon\n   <em>\n    Minelli\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7314755\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/39/593/\">\n    39 A.3d 593\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , because that case concerned whether a claimant, who is receiving unemployment benefits, becomes ineligible by doing occasional, short-term jobs.\n   <em>\n    Minelli\n   </em>\n   has application only in that circumstance. Salon argues that the true test of self-employment is whether the worker is\n   <em>\n    able\n   </em>\n   to work for others, not whether he actually does so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   We begin with a review of the law. A putative employer challenging the assessment of unemployment compensation tax must satisfy the two-prong exception to employment set forth in Section 4(\n   <em>\n    l\n   </em>\n   )(2)(B) of the Law.\n   <em>\n    Cameron v. Department of Labor and Industry, Bureau of Employer Tax Operations\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11911379\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/699/843/#p845\">\n    699 A.2d 843\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 845 (Pa. Cmwlth. 1997). Section 4(\n   <em>\n    l\n   </em>\n   )(2)(B) provides, in relevant part, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   Services performed by an individual for wages shall be deemed to be employment subject to this act,\n   <em>\n    unless and until it is shown\n   </em>\n   to the satisfaction of the department that--(a) such individual has been and will continue to be free from control or direction over the performance of such services both under his contract of service and in fact; and (b) as to such services such individual is customarily engaged in an independently established trade, occupation, profession or business.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   43 P.S. \u00a7 753(\n   <em>\n    l\n   </em>\n   )(2)(B) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Our Supreme Court has established a three-part test for determining whether the putative employee is engaged in \"an independently established trade, occupation or business,\"\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the second prong.\n   <em>\n    Danielle Viktor, Ltd. v. Department of Labor and Industry, Bureau of Employer Tax Operations\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5653587\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/586/196/\">\n    586 Pa. 196\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5653587,8988703\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/892/781/\">\n    892 A.2d 781\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 792 (2006). In determining the independent trade, it must be determined (1) whether the individuals are able to work for more than one entity; (2) whether the individuals depend on the existence of the presumed employer for ongoing work; and (3) whether the individuals were hired on a job-to-job basis and could refuse any assignment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Here, the Department conceded the first prong, so it need not be further addressed. On the second prong, the Department found that all five workers were allowed to provide services to anyone and that their work for Salon did not impede their ability to do so. However, because none of the five actually worked for others\n   at other locations, the Department concluded that they were not \"customarily\" engaged in an independently established trade or business.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In so holding, the Department relied principally on\n   <em>\n    Minelli\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7314755\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/39/593/\">\n    39 A.3d 593\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , which considered whether a claimant receiving unemployment benefits became ineligible under Section 402(h) of the Law,\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   43 P.S. \u00a7 802(h), because she accepted a brief independent consulting position, which lasted about 22 hours over a three-day period. The Unemployment Compensation Board of Review (Board) held that this work rendered her ineligible by reason of self-employment. We reversed. We explained that a claimant's occasional work was \"not enough to demonstrate that [said individual] is customarily engaged in an independently established trade, occupation, profession or business.\"\n   <em>\n    Minelli\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7314755\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/39/593/\">\n    39 A.3d at 598\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Silver v.

Cmwlth. 2011) ). This Court further explained that the\n   <em>\n    Minelli\n   </em>\n   decision \"in no way depart[ed] from the three part test described by our Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Viktor\n   </em>\n   ... to determine whether one is engaged in an 'independently established trade, occupation, profession or business.' \"\n   <em>\n    Minelli\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7314755\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/39/593/\">\n    39 A.3d at 598\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Here, the Department reasoned that\n   <em>\n    Minelli\n   </em>\n   \"added to the\n   <em>\n    Danielle Viktor\n   </em>\n   test[.]\" Department Adjudication at 17; R.R. 20a. This is an incorrect understanding of\n   <em>\n    Minelli\n   </em>\n   , which did not revise the\n   <em>\n    Viktor\n   </em>\n   test; indeed, we specifically so stated.\n   <em>\n    Minelli\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7314755\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/39/593/\">\n    39 A.3d at 598\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Further,\n   <em>\n    Minelli\n   </em>\n   did not hold that an individual must actually work for multiple clients in order to be self-employed. Nor did it hold that one who works only on occasion is necessarily an employee. That an individual may be unsuccessful in obtaining other clients or is simply satisfied working for a single client or at a single location does not transform an independent contractor relationship into that of employer/employee.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    C E Credits OnLine v. Unemployment Compensation Board of Review\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8384685\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/946/1162/\">\n    946 A.2d 1162\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Pa. Cmwlth. 2008).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    Minelli\n   </em>\n   arose under Section 402(h) of the Law, which renders a claimant receiving benefits ineligible if she sets up a business. It has nothing to do with the nature of the claimant's employment relationship with her separating employer. By contrast, Section 4(\n   <em>\n    l\n   </em>\n   )(2)(B) of the Law considers the nature of the employment relationship between claimant and his separating employer. Ironically, the Law does not define \"self-employment.\" It is by the two-part exception to the definition of \"employment\" in Section 4(\n   <em>\n    l\n   </em>\n   )(2)(B) that the meaning of \"self-employment\" has been explicated. Here, none of the workers at Salon is receiving unemployment benefits as a result of a separation from prior employment. This is not a\n   <em>\n    Minelli\n   </em>\n   case. The question is whether they are employees of Salon and subject to the unemployment compensation tax.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <em>\n    Pasour v. Unemployment Compensation Board of Review\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7310768\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/54/134/\">\n    54 A.3d 134\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Pa. Cmwlth. 2012), is instructive. In\n   <em>\n    Pasour\n   </em>\n   , the claimant provided legal services to clients through an attorney referral company, known as Abelson. When his legal services were completed for a client to\n   whom he had been referred, the claimant sought unemployment compensation, asserting that Abelson was his employer. The Board held that because he could do legal services for anyone and was free to refuse referrals from Abelson, he was customarily engaged in an independently established trade or business. On appeal, the claimant asserted that the holding in\n   <em>\n    Minelli\n   </em>\n   required a different result. We rejected that argument, explaining:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   <em>\n    Minelli\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable. In\n   <em>\n    Minelli\n   </em>\n   , we held, based on\n   <em>\n    Silver\n   </em>\n   , that a claimant, who is already receiving [unemployment compensation] benefits, is not disqualified as an independent contractor because the claimant subsequently accepts an occasional work offer on an as-needed basis. We stated, in\n   <em>\n    Silver\n   </em>\n   , \"the fact that an unemployed person agrees to accept, and thereafter does accept, an occasional offer of work is simply not enough to demonstrate that said individual is customarily engaged in an independently established trade, occupation, profession or business.\"\n   <em>\n    Silver\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7273898\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/34/893/#p898\">\n    34 A.3d at 898\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .... Claimant, unlike the claimants in\n   <em>\n    Minelli\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Silver\n   </em>\n   , was not already receiving [unemployment compensation] benefits as a result of his separation from his prior employment. Thus, the question is not, as it was in\n   <em>\n    Minelli\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Silver\n   </em>\n   , whether the position with Abelson disqualified Claimant from receiving benefits for which he was already qualified and receiving, but\n   <em>\n    whether the work Claimant performed for Client, via Abelson, is sufficient to grant [unemployment compensation] benefits in the first instance.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <em>\n    Pasour\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7310768\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/54/134/\">\n    54 A.3d at 139\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   More recently, in\n   <em>\n    Lowman v.

Consistent with\n   <em>\n    Minelli\n   </em>\n   , we held that the central question in a Section 402(h) case is whether an otherwise eligible claimant has taken \"a positive step to embark on an independent trade or business, thereby disqualifying himself for benefits.\"\n   <em>\n    Lowman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12413858\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/178/896/\">\n    178 A.3d at 902\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In sum, the\n   <em>\n    Minelli\n   </em>\n   analysis is used where the Department disqualifies a claimant receiving benefits from further compensation under Section 402(h) of the Law.\n   <em>\n    Minelli\n   </em>\n   is not instructive where, as here, the issue is an audit by the Tax Services Office of a putative employer's business operations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The Department's reliance on\n   <em>\n    Peidong Jia v.

Cmwlth. 2012), is likewise misplaced. In that case, the claimant, a software programmer, worked under a consultant agreement. When his services were no longer needed, he applied for unemployment benefits and argued that he was eligible because he had no other business. This Court agreed that the claimant was eligible because he did not do programming services for any other customer and could not do so because his time was fully consumed by a single employer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   This distinction was clarified one year later in\n   <em>\n    Stauffer v.

The fact that an unemployed person agrees to accept, and thereafter does accept, an occasional offer of work is simply not enough to demonstrate that the individual is engaged in an independently established trade, occupation, profession or business.

The Majority holds that these cases are limited to disqualifying determinations under section 402(h) of the Law and do not apply in the analysis of whether an individual is engaged in an independently established trade, occupation, profession, or business. However, because both\n   <em>\n    Minelli\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Silver\n   </em>\n   form the basis of our precedent regarding application of the \"customarily\" engaged standard, I must strongly disagree.

Rather,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     we are simply recognizing that the Law requires an additional element, that the claimant be\n     <em>\n      customarily\n     </em>\n     engaged in such trade or business in order to be considered self-employed. This element was not discussed in [\n     <em>\n      Danielle Viktor, Ltd.\n     </em>\n     ]\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , or other cases which followed, because the persons found to be independent contractors in those cases were clearly engaged in ongoing business activities rather than an isolated or sporadic job(s).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7273898\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/34/893/#p898\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7314755\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/39/593/\">\n    39 A.3d at 598\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). Indeed, the persons found to be independent contractors in\n   <em>\n    Danielle Viktor, Ltd.\n   </em>\n   , were already recognized as being established limousine drivers who were engaged in ongoing business activities rather than isolated or sporadic jobs and there was no question as to whether they were customarily engaged in the same. Although\n   <em>\n    Minelli\n   </em>\n   involved a different procedural posture,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   the facts therein clearly necessitated a review of section 4(l)(2)(B) of the Law and the three-part independent contractor test approved by our Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Danielle Viktor, Ltd.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Here, the Department found that G.S. performed\n   <strong>\n    part-time\n   </strong>\n   cleaning/janitorial and maintenance work for Petitioner,\n   <strong>\n    did not have his own business\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <strong>\n    worked a regular job\n   </strong>\n   at the M &amp; M factory, and\n   <strong>\n    picked up odds and ends jobs\n   </strong>\n   when he could. (Department's Final Decision and Order at 8.) Clearly, the fact that G.S. does not have his own business and the work in question was classified as \"odds and ends\" precludes a finding that he is an independent contractor. Regarding C.S., the Department found that he was a\n   <strong>\n    college student\n   </strong>\n   who\n   <strong>\n    helped\n   </strong>\n   Petitioner/Petitioner's owner\n   <strong>\n    with her children\n   </strong>\n   and with\n   <strong>\n    cleaning duties\n   </strong>\n   , and also\n   <strong>\n    worked\n   </strong>\n   at the local Red Robin\n   <strong>\n    restaurant\n   </strong>\n   .\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7314755\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/39/593/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Regarding B.G., the Department found that she assisted Petitioner/Petitioner's owner with\n   <strong>\n    babysitting\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    janitorial duties\n   </strong>\n   approximately\n   <strong>\n    one or two days\n   </strong>\n   a week and also\n   <strong>\n    worked for a temp agency\n   </strong>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   There were no findings by the Department as to whether these individuals were customarily engaged in any of these services or whether G.S., C.S., or B.G. depended on the existence of Petitioner for ongoing work. However, the Majority makes its own finding as to whether they depended on Petitioner for ongoing work in the negative. Nonetheless, this finding alone would not qualify G.S., C.S., or B.G. as independent contractors because there was no evidence they were customarily engaged in offering such services as part of an independently established trade, occupation, profession, or business.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   As noted above, with regard to the second prong of the\n   <em>\n    Danielle Viktor, Ltd.\n   </em>\n   test, our Supreme Court has explained that \"a worker can be considered an independent contractor only if he or she is in business for himself or herself.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5653587,8988703\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/892/781/\">\n    892 A.2d at 798\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, the Department recognized as much, stating that \"\n   <strong>\n    the relevant inquiry seems to be whether [G.S., C.S., and B.G.] performed the same services as part of an independent business or for other businesses\n   </strong>\n   .\" (Department's Final Decision and Order at 27-28.)\n   <strong>\n    The Department went on to conclude that such a\n   </strong>\n   \"\n   <strong>\n    showing clearly was not made with respect to the three cleaning personnel in dispute: GS, CS, and BG\n   </strong>\n   .\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28.) Moreover, the record indicates that these individuals occasionally worked for Petitioner as needed under a non-fixed schedule, and while each of these individuals worked other jobs, the other jobs were unrelated to the services they performed for Petitioner and, hence, do not show that they had independent businesses providing such services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   With respect to the final prong of this test, the record establishes that G.S., C.S., and B.G. could refuse any assignment, but only C.S. and B.G. were hired on a job-to-job basis. The nature of G.S.'s hiring was, at best, ambiguous in the record, which merely indicated that he performed janitorial work a couple of hours per week for Petitioner since 2013. The record is not clear if this work was steady each week or merely on an as-needed basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Based on this record, the Department correctly found there was insufficient evidence to conclude that G.S., C.S., or B.G. were in business for themselves offering babysitting, cleaning/janitorial, and/or laundry services to demonstrate that they were customarily engaged in an independently established trade, occupation, profession or business.
