On appeal, the defendants claim that the court improperly found that the plaintiff met its burden of proving its prima facie case and that the defendants failed to prove their special defenses of equitable estoppel and unclean hands. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following facts are relevant to this appeal. The defendants and the McCue Mortgage Company (McCue) executed a promissory note on December 1, 2008 (note). The note was secured by a mortgage\n   on the defendants' property at 40 McGuire Road in Trumbull (property), in favor of Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc., as nominee for McCue. The mortgage was recorded on the Trumbull land records on December 1, 2008. The mortgage was assigned to the plaintiff on December 16, 2011, and the assignment was recorded on the Trumbull land records on December 21, 2011. It is undisputed that the plaintiff is the holder of both the note and the mortgage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The plaintiff filed this foreclosure action on October 19, 2011. The complaint alleged that the note and mortgage were in default by virtue of nonpayment of the installments of principal and interest due on November 1, 2010, and each and every month thereafter. The complaint further alleged that the plaintiff is entitled to collect the debt evidenced by the note and to enforce the terms of the mortgage, that the plaintiff had elected to accelerate the balance of the note, and that the plaintiff requested a foreclosure of the mortgaged premises.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The court referred the parties to a foreclosure mediation program on December 1, 2011. During that program, the parties entered into a special forbearance\n   agreement (agreement) dated August 23, 2012, which identified twenty-two consecutive months of nonpayment. According to the terms of the agreement, the plaintiff agreed to \"temporarily [accept] reduced installments\" in the amount of $3009.07 per month for a period of three months.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Section 2 of the agreement provides in relevant part: \"Upon successful completion of the [a]greement, your loan will not be contractually current. Since the installments may be less than the total amount due you may still have outstanding payments and fees. Any outstanding payments and fees will be reviewed for an option to bring the loan current. If approved for an option, based on investor guidelines, this will satisfy the remaining past due payments on your loan and we will send you a plan agreement. An additional payment may be required.\" Section 3 of the agreement provides: \"The lender is under no obligation to enter into any further agreement, and this [a]greement shall not constitute a waiver of the lender's right to insist upon strict performance in the future.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The defendants made the first payment of $3009.07 in accordance with the agreement prior to September 22, 2012. On October 8, 2012, the plaintiff sent the defendants a letter requesting a \"Notice of Release of Mortgage or Discharge of Judgment/Lien\" and stating that the plaintiff is \"unable to complete the final modification\" of the loan until the title issue is resolved. A property title report was enclosed with the letter. The lien at issue was a judgment lien on the property from a dispute with an insurance company about the value\n   of a vehicle Lorson owned that had been declared a total loss (judgment lien).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On October 19, 2012, the foreclosure mediator issued a final report that indicated that the final mediation was held on July\n   31, 2012, the mediation period expired on September 1, 2012, and the mediation was terminated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The defendants did not provide the plaintiff with information in response to the October 8, 2012 letter, but instead continued to make monthly payments to the plaintiff for the amount specified in the agreement beyond November, 2012, and through May, 2013. On March 4, 2013, the plaintiff sent the defendants a follow-up letter requesting documentation to resolve the title issue regarding the judgment lien on the property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   On April 10, 2013, the plaintiff sent the defendants another letter, stating that \"[t]here are additional liens on [the defendants'] property that prevent [the plaintiff] from completing [the defendants'] request for mortgage assistance.\" On April 30, 2013, the plaintiff sent yet another letter to the defendants requesting documentation of the remaining lien balance. The letter specified that the requested documentation must be received by May 30, 2013. The defendants did not resolve the judgment lien.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The defendants filed an answer on July 19, 2013, in which they effectively denied each allegation and left the plaintiff to its proof. The defendants also filed two special defenses alleging unclean hands and equitable\n   estoppel. The plaintiff filed a motion for summary judgment on November 12, 2013. The defendants filed an amended answer and special defenses along with their objection to the plaintiff's summary judgment motion on February 19, 2014. In the amended answer, the defendants alleged a third special defense titled \"Mortgage Modification Agreement,\" claiming that the plaintiff refused to issue a permanent modification and \"breached the terms of the agreement\" by requiring payment of the judgment lien.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The court denied the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment on March 21, 2014, ruling that \"the counteraffidavit submitted by the defendants in opposition to the motion raises issues of fact relating to the defendants' special defenses of unclean hands and equitable estoppel to be resolved at trial.\" The plaintiff filed a reply to the defendants' special defenses and a certificate of closed pleadings on October 22, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   After the plaintiff filed a certificate of closed pleadings, the defendants moved to amend their answer on October 30, 2015. In the proposed amended answer, the defendants added a special defense titled \"breach of contract,\" which alleged the plaintiff's noncompliance with various regulations of the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development as set forth in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20203.500\">\n    24 C.F.R. \u00a7 203.500\n   </extracted-citation>\n   et. seq. (HUD regulations). The plaintiff filed an objection to the defendants' request to amend on November 9, 2015, and the court sustained the plaintiff's objection on December 1, 2015, the first day of trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Following a two day bench trial, the court rendered judgment of strict foreclosure in favor of the plaintiff on January 6, 2016. On January 20, 2016, the defendants filed this appeal. The defendants filed a motion for articulation on August 4, 2016, requesting an explanation for the judgment of strict foreclosure. On November 25, 2016, the court issued a written response \"to\n   the allegations contained in the defendants' motion [for] articulation and, specifically, the defendants' misrepresentations and failure to disclose necessary evidence within their knowledge.\" In that response, the court stated: \"Based on the factual history of this litigation, it is the finding of this court that the plaintiff has\n   established [its] burden of proof with respect to the allegations of the complaint. The court further finds that the defendants failed to submit sufficient evidence with respect to their burden of proof with respect to the denial of the complaint, as well as the special defenses of unclean hands and equitable estoppel. Accordingly, judgment is entered in favor of the plaintiff with respect to the complaint and special defenses.\" The court denied the motion for articulation and stated as follows: \"With respect to the motion for articulation, it is the finding of the court that the motion is based on the misrepresentations and intentional omissions of necessary evidence. The docket sufficiently provides the basis for the rulings by the court. Accordingly, the motion for articulation is denied.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On April 4, 2017, the defendants filed a motion for review of the court's articulation with this court, which we denied as untimely. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The defendants challenge the court's determination that the plaintiff had proven its prima facie case, which was based on their claim that the plaintiff failed to present sufficient evidence that it had complied with all applicable HUD regulations that are prerequisites to bringing a foreclosure action. In response, the plaintiff contends that noncompliance with HUD regulations must be raised as a special defense and that the defendants failed to do so. Alternatively, the plaintiff argues that even if it had the burden of proving compliance\n   with HUD regulations in the absence of a special defense, there is sufficient evidence of the plaintiff's compliance, and, therefore, the court's finding that the plaintiff established its prima facie case was not clearly erroneous. We conclude that the defendants had the affirmative duty to plead noncompliance with HUD regulations as a special defense and that their failure to do so is fatal to their claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The following additional facts are relevant to the defendants' claim. The defendants' mortgage was guaranteed and insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA). The note and mortgage reference HUD regulations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Section 6 (b)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   of the note provides in relevant part that \"[i]f Borrower defaults by failing to pay in full any monthly payment, then Lender may, except as limited by regulations of the Secretary [of HUD] in the\n   case of payment defaults, require immediate payment in full of the principal balance remaining due and all accrued interest. Lender may choose not to exercise this option without waiving its rights in the event of any subsequent default. In many circumstances regulations issued by the Secretary [of HUD] will limit Lender's rights to require immediate payment in full in the case of payment defaults. This Note does not authorize acceleration when not permitted by HUD regulations.\" Section 9 (a) of the mortgage deed provides in relevant part: \"Lender may, except as limited by regulations issued by the Secretary [of HUD] in the case of payment defaults, require immediate payment in full of all sums secured by this Security Instrument ....\" It is uncontested that the HUD regulations apply to the defendants' mortgage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The defendants neither filed a motion to strike the plaintiff's complaint nor timely raised the plaintiff's noncompliance with HUD regulations as a special defense. Following the filing of the certificate of closed pleadings on October 22, 2015, the defendants moved to amend their answer for a second time on October 30, 2015. The second requested amended answer added thirty-three pages to the first amended answer and included three additional special defenses with a twelve count counterclaim. One of the additional special defenses alleged that the plaintiff failed to comply with nineteen different HUD regulations and requirements that, according to the defendants, were conditions precedent to acceleration of the debt and commencement of this foreclosure action. The plaintiff objected to the defendants' request as untimely and noted that trial was already scheduled for December 1, 2015. In its objection to the defendants' request, the plaintiff argued that \"to allow [the] defendants an additional opportunity to amend their pleadings on the eve of trial, especially when such an amendment would fundamentally alter\n   the procedural posture of the case would, in effect, amount to pleading by ambuscade and would work extreme prejudice and delay upon the plaintiff.\" The court denied the defendants' request to amend their answer and sustained the plaintiff's objection on December 1, 2015.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Moreover, at trial, an employee of the plaintiff, Dustin Green, was cross-examined by the defendants' counsel regarding the plaintiff's compliance with the HUD regulations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Notably, Green testified that the plaintiff was compliant, and the defendants produced no evidence to the contrary, despite having had the opportunity to testify, produce witnesses, and cross-examine the plaintiff's witness. The court never precluded the defendants from presenting evidence, either through their own testimony or otherwise, of the plaintiff's alleged violation of HUD regulations. At the conclusion of trial, the court found that the plaintiff had established its burden of proof with respect to the allegations of the complaint. The defendants challenge the propriety of that finding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   At the outset, we note that to the extent that the defendants' claim involves construing rules of practice, our review is plenary.\n   <em>\n    Howard-Arnold, Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    T.N.T.

The defendants argue that the compliance with HUD regulations was a condition precedent to the enforcement of the note and mortgage and that the plaintiff bore the burden of proving that all such regulatory requirements had been satisfied as a part of its prima facie case. This court has determined that the plaintiff must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that it satisfied any conditions precedent to establish a prima facie case in a foreclosure action.

In addition, the defendants claims that the plaintiff failed to establish compliance with HUD Mortgagee Letter 2000-05. Although there is no dispute that the plaintiff was required to\n   comply with the HUD regulations, we are not persuaded that it was the plaintiff's burden to prove compliance as part of its prima facie case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Courts outside of Connecticut have recognized that, in a foreclosure action involving an FHA-insured mortgage, a plaintiff's noncompliance with the HUD regulations is a valid affirmative defense.

As noted previously in this opinion, the defendants did not move to strike the complaint because it failed to allege an essential fact. Nor did their answer provide any notice to the plaintiff that compliance with HUD regulations was in any way an issue in this case. The plaintiff, thus, put on evidence in support of the allegations actually pleaded in the complaint to prove its prima facie case. The defendants' reliance on allegations of noncompliance with HUD regulations is essentially a defense that is consistent with the plaintiff's allegations but, if proven, would show that the plaintiff has no cause of action. As such,\n   allegations of noncompliance needed to be raised as a special defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   To hold otherwise would encourage trial by ambuscade and impose an unnecessary and undue burden on plaintiffs in foreclosure matters. There are potentially dozens of HUD requirements that a defendant could argue are necessary prerequisites to the bringing of a foreclosure action. The defendants' proposed amended complaint identified nineteen such requirements with which the plaintiff allegedly failed to comply. It is inconsistent with our expectation that trials are not supposed to be a game of blindman's bluff to expect a plaintiff in a foreclosure action to anticipate which HUD requirement a defendant will seize upon to argue after the plaintiff rests that it has failed to prove its case. Foreclosure trials, and motions for summary judgment in foreclosure actions, in which the facts are largely undisputed, would become drawn-out, expensive affairs as a plaintiff presents evidence regarding a lengthy list of requirements. Moreover, because plaintiffs typically are entitled to an award of attorney's fees upon the entry of judgment, the parties truly harmed by imposing such requirements on foreclosing plaintiffs are the borrowers who will be required to pay the additional fees caused by\n   such a procedure. Consequently, in this particular context, it makes much more sense to require the defendant to plead the specific requirements that have not been met and bear the burden of proving the plaintiff's noncompliance with those requirements. Not only is this more logical and more fair to plaintiffs and the vast majority of defendants who have no interest in raising such issues, it also is consistent with the manner in which other states have addressed the issue and the guidance provided by HUD itself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   It is uncontested that defendants failed to plead the plaintiff's noncompliance with the HUD regulations as\n   a special defense or a specific denial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   After the certificate of closed pleadings had been filed, the defendants attempted to raise the issue as a special defense, but the court denied the defendants' request.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   By failing to plead the plaintiff's noncompliance as a special defense, the defendants did not properly apprise the court, or the plaintiff, of the issue.

Furthermore, the defendants argue that the representations in the agreement were intended to induce the defendants to believe in the existence of those facts\n   and that the plaintiff had knowledge, actual or constructive, of the real facts because any requirement that satisfaction of a lien as a prerequisite to a permanent mortgage modification existed at the time that the forbearance agreement was offered. In sum, the defendants claim that the conduct of the plaintiff's loan servicing department resulted in their inability to afford the payoff for the judgment lien because they continued to make the trial period payments each month in the amount of $3009.07 through May, 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The defendants' claim is without merit. The defendants fail to point to specific conduct of the plaintiff that caused the defendants to believe that they only had to pay three trial period payments for a permanent loan modification. The agreement specifically stated that \"investor approval is still pending\" and that \"the lender is under no obligation to enter into any further agreement, and this [a]greement shall not constitute a waiver of the lender's right to insist upon strict performance in the future.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Lorson testified that he was unaware that the three payments would not result in a final loan modification. Lorson stated: \"No, I was not aware of that. My understanding was, the forbearance agreement was, once we got into that, as long as I held up my end of the agreement when I made the payments I would get the mortgage modification.\" The plaintiff, however, sent the defendants a letter in October, 2012, before the defendants had made their second of the three required trial payments, informing them that their loan modification could not be completed unless the judgment lien was resolved. The defendants acknowledged receipt of that letter, but explained that they continued to make the trial period payments because they were \"assuming that [they would] be able to resolve the issue with the lien and continue on and get the modification, and\n   [they]\n   didn't want to screw that up by not making the payments.\" Consequently, the evidence specifically contradicts the defendants' claim that the plaintiff represented to the defendants that the loan modification necessarily would be final once the three trial payments were complete. Accordingly, the defendants have failed to establish that the court's finding that they did not present sufficient evidence to establish that their special defense of equitable estoppel was clearly erroneous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The defendants' final claim is that the court's finding that the defendants failed to present sufficient evidence with respect to the special defense of unclean hands was clearly erroneous. The defendants argue that the testimony of the plaintiff's employee and the uncontroverted documentary evidence clearly establishes that the plaintiff was aware of all the HUD requirements that it was obligated to satisfy before commencing this foreclosure action. The defendants maintain that the complete failure to comply with almost all of said requirements raises a necessary inference that the plaintiff's conduct in simply ignoring its obligations was wilful and committed in bad faith. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Our Supreme Court has recognized that the \"[a]pplication of the doctrine of unclean hands rests within the sound discretion of the trial court....

Because the evidence was admitted and the plaintiff did not object to the introduction of the HUD regulations into the record, the defendants argue that the plaintiff has waived any alleged failure to plead noncompliance with the regulations as a special defense. \"It is well established that a failure to allege a special defense is waived if evidence relating to that special defense is admitted without objection.\"\n    <em>\n     Sidney\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     DeVries\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"742924\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/18/581/#p587\">\n     18 Conn.

The failure to plead a special defense, however, was not waived here by the mere admission of the HUD regulations as an exhibit. The HUD regulations are simply regulations, and not themselves evidence of the plaintiff's noncompliance. Thus, the issue of noncompliance with the HUD regulations was not fully litigated at trial. Because the defendants did not introduce any evidence of the plaintiff's noncompliance with the HUD regulations, they have failed to establish that the plaintiff's objection has been waived.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    Even if we were to assume that the defendants properly presented this claim to the trial court and that the plaintiff had the burden of proving compliance with all HUD regulations, the defendants fail to establish that the court's determination that the plaintiff established its prima facie case was clearly erroneous. The defendants appear to suggest that the plaintiff presented no evidence that it complied with any of the HUD regulations and that the evidence established that the plaintiff failed to comply with the regulations in several crucial respects. In fact, evidence was presented to the contrary; see footnote 6 of this opinion; and the defendants failed to present any evidence of the plaintiff's noncompliance with the HUD regulations through their own witness or through cross-examination of Green. With evidence in the record of the plaintiff's compliance and no evidence presented to the contrary, the court's finding that the plaintiff established its prima facie case was not clearly erroneous.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"11\">\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    The defendants contend that if they knew \"that they did not need to make extra monthly mortgage payments past the trial period, they could have afforded the payoff [of] the judgment lien and therefore obtained the permanent modification that would have prevented the prosecution of the foreclosure action.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
