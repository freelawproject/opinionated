Starble, appeals from the judgment of the Superior Court dismissing\n   her appeal from the decision of the Inland Wetlands Commission of the Town of New Hartford (commission) granting Roger J. Schiffert and Linda Schiffert's (applicants)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   application for a permit to build a driveway across wetlands on their property. On appeal, the plaintiff contends that the court incorrectly (1) concluded that the requirement of presenting feasible and prudent alternatives under General Statutes \u00a7 22a-41 (a) (2) and (b) (2), and under \u00a7 7.5 (f) of the Town of New Hartford Inland Wetlands and Watercourses Regulations (regulations) was directory rather than mandatory, and (2) applied the substantial evidence test to review the record of the proceedings before the commission.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   We agree with both\n   claims, and, accordingly, reverse the judgment of the Superior Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The following facts are relevant to this appeal. The applicants' property is a 25.9 acre parcel of land on the eastern side of Town Hill Road in New Hartford. The property has only 305 feet of road frontage, remains narrow for approximately 1000 feet and broadens to over 650 feet in width at its far eastern end. The property also includes a watercourse and wetlands. On July 2, 2014, the applicants filed an application with the commission seeking a permit to build a single-family dwelling (house) at the eastern end of the property, with a driveway that would run through a section of the wetlands. The commission determined that the proposed plan could significantly impact the wetlands and held public hearings on the application. Thereafter, the applicants submitted revised plans that reduced the area of disturbance to the wetlands from 3400 square feet to 3015 square feet. At a public hearing on October 1, 2014, the plaintiff, along with other abutting owners, not party to this appeal, objected to the applicants' proposed plan.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plaintiff presented to the commission a report from Marc Goodin, an engineer, stating that the proposed plan would disturb the wetlands and that there were other feasible and prudent alternatives that the applicants had failed to present to the commission. The report also stated that \"the most obvious feasible and prudent alternative\" was to build the house on the western section of the property. Because the western section was close to the road, the report stated, it would obviate the need to build a driveway through the wetlands. Goodin, however, was not available to testify at the public hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The commission also heard testimony from three expert witnesses, David Whitney, Tom Pietras, and Clint Webb, on behalf of the applicants. All three experts stated that constructing a house on the eastern section\n   of the property was prudent because that section had better draining soils for the septic system and gentler slopes that required fewer cut and fill operations. Webb, the expert qualified to evaluate wetlands and watercourse impacts, concluded that the proposed activities would have no or de minimis impact on the function of the wetlands resources on the property. As to the alternative proposed by the plaintiff's expert, Webb testified that building a house on the western side of the property required significant cutting and filling as well as a cut into the ground water that fed the wetlands. He also testified that building on the western side would be more expensive, would require a more substantial area for a septic system than on the eastern side and would\n   result in more storm water runoff. Webb therefore concluded that building on the western side as the plaintiff had suggested, although feasible, would not be prudent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The commission found the testimony of the applicants' experts credible and adopted their conclusions as to the impact of the proposed construction on the wetlands. The commission then approved the application, making the following relevant findings: \"The central claim of the intervenors is that a feasible and prudent alternative exists, namely, construction of the single-family dwelling on the western, rather than eastern, portion of the property, obviating the need for a wetlands crossing.... The intervenors have failed to prove that [the] applicants are proposing activities that are reasonably likely to unreasonably pollute, impair, or destroy the public trust in the air, water, or other natural resources of the State of Connecticut.... Even if the intervenors proved that the proposed activities will unreasonably pollute, impair or destroy the public trust in the air, water, or other natural resource of the State of Connecticut, they have failed to prove that requiring the applicants to develop on the western\n   portion of the property is a feasible and prudent alternative to the proposed activities.\" The commission thereafter approved the applicants' plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The plaintiff appealed to the Superior Court claiming that the commission had (1) misinterpreted and misapplied the feasible and prudent standard under \u00a7 22a-41, and under \u00a7\u00a7 7.5 (f) and 10.3 of the regulations, and (2) failed to follow reasonable and acceptable procedures for deliberations, voting and use of legal opinions during deliberations. As to the first claim, the Superior Court concluded that although the commission initially had been advised of the incorrect standard, that advice subsequently was corrected and the commission properly applied the \"feasible and prudent\" standard under \u00a7 22a-41. With regard to the second claim, the Superior Court concluded that the commission implicitly had found that there was no feasible and prudent alternative but that it had provided inadequate reasons in support of this finding. The Superior Court then undertook a review of the record and concluded that the commission's \"implicit findings\" were supported by substantial evidence. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On appeal to this court, the plaintiff claims that the Superior Court incorrectly (1) concluded that the requirement of presenting feasible and prudent alternatives under \u00a7 22a-41 (a) (2) and (b) (2), and under \u00a7 7.5 (f) of the regulations was directory rather than mandatory, and (2) applied the substantial evidence test to review the record of the proceedings before the commission.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The plaintiff claims that the Superior Court incorrectly concluded that the requirement of presenting feasible and prudent alternatives under \u00a7 22a-41 (a) (2) and (b) (2), and under \u00a7 7.5 (f) of the regulations was\n   directory rather than mandatory. Specifically, the plaintiff argues that \u00a7 7.5 (f) implements the applicants' statutory burden under \u00a7 22a-41 (b), and that it, therefore, cannot merely be directory. In response, the defendants contend that the language of \u00a7 7.5 (f) cannot be read as mandatory in light of this court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Weinstein\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Inland Wetlands Agency\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4233677\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/124/50/\">\n    124 Conn.

The defendants also argue that even if they did not comply with \u00a7 7.5 (f) of the regulations, the purpose behind that provision was satisfied because the commission considered the alternative of building on\n   the western side of the property and heard expert testimony as to its viability. Consequently, the defendants argue that the commission's decision should only be set aside if the noncompliance with \u00a7 7.5 (f) resulted in \"material prejudice\" to the plaintiff. We agree with the plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   At the outset we note that the \"[r]esolution of the issue presented requires us to review and to interpret the relevant statutory provisions and town regulations.

Also, the requirement that alternatives be diagramed on a site plan or drawing is clearly designed for the convenience of the commission 'to secure order, system and dispatch' rather than as a matter of substance. For these reasons, the commission's decision is not invalid simply because\n   the applicants did not diagram any alternatives on a site plan or drawing as required by \u00a7 7.5 (f).\" Although the Superior Court correctly concluded that the requirement to diagram alternatives does not render \u00a7 7.5 (f) mandatory, it did not assess the effect of \u00a7 22a-41 (b) on \u00a7 7.5 (f). In this regard, \u00a7 1.5 of the regulations is particularly instructive. That section provides that \"[t]he Agency shall enforce the Inland Wetlands and Watercourses Act and shall issue, with terms, conditions, limitations or modifications,\n   <em>\n    or deny permits for all regulated activities in the Town of New Hartford pursuant to sections 22a-36 to 22a-45, inclusive, of the Connecticut General Statutes, as amended.\n   </em>\n   \" (Emphasis added.) Thus, \u00a7 1.5 makes clear that \u00a7 7.5 (f), which sets forth application requirements for permits, operates in consonance with \u00a7 22a-41 (b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Weinstein\n   </em>\n   , this court reiterated that the \"test to be applied in determining whether a statute is mandatory or directory is ... whether it relates to a matter of substance or a matter of convenience....

[That] ... standard ... goes a long way towards codifying protection of inland wetlands so that they will not be intruded upon as long as a feasible and prudent alternative to the intrusion on the wetlands exists....\" Id., pp. 3115-16. It is clear to us, therefore, that the applicant's burden to prove the absence of a feasible and prudent alternative is reflective of the legislature's intent to protect the inland wetlands of this state and thus a matter of substance. In the present case, because the regulations require the commission to grant or deny applications pursuant to the statutory scheme of \u00a7 22a-41 ; see \u00a7 1.5 of the regulations; \u00a7 7.5 (f) of the regulations necessarily implements the burden of proof set forth in \u00a7 22a-41 (b). Consequently, \u00a7 7.5 (f) deals with a \"matter of substance\" in that it carries an applicant's burden of proof under General Statutes \u00a7 22a-41 (b) ; it is, therefore, mandatory\n   and not directory. Additionally, the use of the word \"shall\" in both \u00a7 7.5 (f) and \u00a7 1.5, further strengthens our conclusion. \"[A]lthough we have often stated [that] [d]efinite words, such as must or shall, ordinarily express legislative mandates of a nondirectory nature ... we also have noted that the use of the word shall, though significant, does not invariably establish a mandatory duty.... [T]he test to apply in determining whether the use of the word shall connotes a mandatory duty, or is merely directory, is whether the prescribed mode of action is the essence of the thing to be accomplished, or in other words, whether it relates to a matter of substance or convenience....

Given our conclusion that \u00a7 7.5 (f) relates to a matter of substance, the use of the word \"shall\" in that section further accentuates its mandatory nature.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Superior Court correctly noted that there is no express language in \u00a7 7.5 (f) of the regulations that would invalidate any action taken after noncompliance; that, however, is only one of several factors that reviewing courts have, in the past, considered in determining whether a provision is mandatory or directory.

In the present case, the absence of express language invalidating noncompliance with \u00a7 7.5 (f) does not militate against the mandatory nature of the requirement that the applicants present feasible and prudent alternatives.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Finally, the defendants' argument that the commission essentially considered the alternative of building on the western side of the property misses the point that it was the applicants' burden to propose less harmful alternatives and to prove that the proposed plan, nonetheless, should be approved. See General Statutes \u00a7 22a-41 (a) (2) (alternative must be\n   <em>\n    less\n   </em>\n   harmful to wetlands than proposed activity). Because this burden constitutes a matter of substance, the Superior Court incorrectly concluded that the requirement to present alternatives in \u00a7 7.5 (f) is directory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The plaintiff also claims that the Superior Court incorrectly applied the substantial evidence test to review the record of the proceedings before the commission because the commission's approval contained explicit, rather than implicit, findings that had been made using an incorrect legal standard. Specifically, the plaintiff argues that our Supreme Court's holding in\n   <em>\n    Gibbons\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Historic District Commission,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3958239\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/285/755/\">\n    285 Conn. 755\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=941%20A.2d%20917\">\n    941 A.2d 917\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2008), forbids, on appeal, a review of the record when an inland wetlands agency makes explicit findings. Because the commission's improper findings in the present case were explicit, the plaintiff argues that the Superior Court erroneously searched the record for substantial evidence in support of what the commission properly should have found.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In response, the defendants contend that the commission did not make an explicit finding, rather its approval of the application constituted an implicit finding under\n   \u00a7 22a-41 (b), that a feasible and prudent alternative did not exist. Because that finding was implicit, the defendants argue, the Superior Court did not err in searching the record for substantial evidence in support of it. In so arguing, the defendants rely on our Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Samperi\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Inland Wetlands Agency\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"738694\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/226/579/#p593\">\n    226 Conn. 579\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=628%20A.2d%201286\">\n    628 A.2d 1286\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , for the proposition that an inland wetlands agency is not required to state explicitly that a reasonable and prudent alternative to the proposed activity does not exist.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Consequently, the defendants contend that the Superior Court was entitled to search the record for substantial evidence and to infer a finding that no other feasible and prudent alternative existed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The defendants also argue that this case is different from\n   <em>\n    Gibbons\n   </em>\n   , in which our Supreme Court declined, on appeal, to review the record for substantial evidence in support of a completely different reason from that which the commission had stated. They assert that, unlike\n   <em>\n    Gibbons\n   </em>\n   , the only testimony in the present case in support of the commission's implicit finding was regarded by the commission to be credible. The defendants therefore argue that relying on that testimony to reach the finding the commission properly should have made does not invade the commission's fact-finding mission.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The precise question before us, then, is whether the Superior Court properly reviewed\n   the record for substantial evidence in light of the stated findings of the commission. We conclude that it did not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \"Whether the substantial evidence test was applied properly by the trial court in its review of an inland\n   wetlands agency's decision is a question of law over which our review is plenary.... [T]he reviewing court must sustain the agency's determination if an examination of the record discloses evidence that supports any one of the reasons given.... The evidence, however, to support any such reason must be substantial; [t]he credibility of witnesses and the determination of factual issues are matters within the province of the administrative agency.... This so-called substantial evidence rule is similar to the sufficiency of the evidence standard applied in judicial review of jury verdicts, and evidence is sufficient to sustain an agency finding if it affords a substantial basis of fact from which the fact in issue can be reasonably inferred.\" (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    AvalonBay Communities, Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Inland Wetlands &amp; Watercourses Agency,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4262853\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/130/69/#p75\">\n    130 Conn.

On appeal to our Supreme Court, the plaintiffs claimed that the commission was required under \u00a7 22a-41 (b) to create\n   a record showing that it had considered each and every alternative. The court rejected that argument, noting that \"the local inland wetlands agency is required only to manifest in some verifiable fashion that it has made a finding of no feasible and prudent alternative.

Rather, it clarifies that in \"cases in which [an agency's] finding is\n   <em>\n    implicit in its decision\n   </em>\n   , the reviewing court has the responsibility to search the record for substantial evidence in support of the agency's action.\" (Emphasis added.)

In\n   <em>\n    Samperi\n   </em>\n   , the agency's approval of the permit, in the absence of any other explanation, constituted an implicit finding that there was no reasonable or prudent alternative to the proposed activity. In the present case, by contrast, the commission\n   supported its decision with several express findings. As to reasonable and prudent alternatives, the commission noted first that \"[t]he intervenors have failed to prove that [the] applicants are proposing activities that are reasonably likely to unreasonably pollute, impair, or destroy the public trust in the air, water, or other natural resources of the State of Connecticut.\" The commission then specifically found that the\n   <em>\n    plaintiff\n   </em>\n   had \"failed to prove that requiring the\n   applicants to develop on the western portion of the property is a feasible and prudent alternative to the proposed activities.\" Because these findings were explicit,\n   <em>\n    Samperi\n   </em>\n   is inapposite.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Instead, the present case is controlled by our Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Gibbons\n   </em>\n   .

Consequently, in the\n   present case, the Superior Court should not have searched the record after it found that the commission had provided inadequate reasons.
