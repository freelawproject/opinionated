We affirm.\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The following facts are undisputed. The Club, a New Jersey not-for-profit corporation, was established to operate a community consisting of approximately 986 lots individually owned by members, with common areas including a clubhouse. The Club leases a bay beach and an ocean beach from the original developer, defendant Ocean Beach Pearl, LLC. Plaintiffs own homes in the Club's community.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Club was established in the 1950s, with the filing of a map and deed by the Ocean Beach Corporation. The Club's certificate of incorporation gave the Club the broad mandate \"[t]o promote and protect the general welfare and property rights of the property owner members in the use and enjoyment of their property at\" the Club. The deed established a community scheme through building restrictions which, among other things, provided that \"no[ ] more than one residence nor more than [a] one-story one-family dwelling shall be allowed on any lot,\" and imposed setback requirements. The deed allowed the Club to adopt rules and regulations concerning the construction and modification of homes in the community.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The deed and bylaws require every resident to be a member of the Club. The members elect the Board of Trustees (Board). The Board manages the Club and is empowered to establish and change the rules and the regulations as needed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Superstorm Sandy damaged or destroyed many homes in the Club's community, including plaintiffs' homes. As a result, in October 2014, March 2015, and November 2015, the Board enacted rule changes and clarified and expanded building requirements connected with flood zone compliance. Although these post-Sandy rule changes allowed members to elevate their homes, Alloco was denied permission to elevate his home even higher to allow the space beneath the elevated structure to be used for parking.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In January 2014, plaintiffs filed a complaint in the trial court. The second amended complaint contains four counts. In count one, plaintiffs sought a declaratory judgment regarding the obligation to reconstruct damaged properties. In count two, plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief regarding the enforcement and scope of the Club's restrictions and regulations, and the approvals of applications for development.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Count three alleged that the Board violated the business judgment rule by adopting and enforcing its rules and regulations. In particular, plaintiffs alleged the \"Club acted incompetently in devising regulations limiting the height of structures.\" They also claimed the Club engaged in self-dealing and breached its fiduciary duties to the members. Count four alleged the Club failed to comply with the Club's certificate of incorporation, violated public policy, and violated the New Jersey Nonprofit Corporation Act, N.J.S.A. 15A:1-1 to 16-2. Plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief, counsel fees, and costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The claims in count one and most of the claims in count two were resolved.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs filed a motion for summary judgment with respect to counts three and four of their complaint. The Club filed a cross-motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On September 16, 2016, the trial court, citing the business judgment rule, denied plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment, granted the Club's motion for summary judgment, and dismissed the complaint. Plaintiffs appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Summary judgment must be granted if \"the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories and admissions on file, together with affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact challenged and that the moving party is\n   entitled to a judgment or order as a matter of law.\"\n   <em>\n    R.\n   </em>\n   4:46-2(c).

Plaintiffs did not claim fraud or unconscionability. Rather, they argued the Board engaged in self-dealing because it failed to uniformly enforce rules and restrictions. However, plaintiffs' claims are unsubstantiated and unrelated to the Board's actions, such as the height limitations that plaintiffs challenge in this litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   First, plaintiffs asserted Board President John Houseworth and the Board were aware that fellow Board member Joseph Bruno violated the Club's rule that \"construction in progress must cease on June 15th\" \"until after Labor Day,\" but did nothing about it, and did not include Bruno as a defendant in the Club's lawsuit to stop violations of the summer construction ban. However, Houseworth testified at his deposition he was only aware that Bruno was \"fixing windows.\" Plaintiffs cited the deposition testimony of a former Club security guard that while on patrol he observed and reported the construction activity at Bruno's property. However, the security guard was not aware whether or not Bruno had obtained a hardship waiver from the Club that would have made the reported construction permissible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Second, plaintiffs alleged that the house of a former Board member, James Freehan, violated the setback requirement. However, Houseworth testified only that he had \"no recollection as to whether or not this has ever been investigated.\" Plaintiffs proffered no evidence that such a violation had occurred, had been\n   brought to the Board's attention, or that non-Board members were investigated for similar building violations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Third, plaintiffs alleged that Houseworth engaged in self-dealing because he paid $2200 for the demolition of his house that was damaged in Superstorm Sandy. Plaintiffs noted the Board had awarded a demolition company a contract to perform the\n   demolitions at the Club for $4000 per home. However, Houseworth certified that the reduced rate was the result of bargain struck between Houseworth and the demolition company that allowed the company to keep all the possessions and fixtures within the home. Plaintiffs presented no contrary evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Fourth, plaintiffs claimed self-dealing because Houseworth's outdoor deck was approved even though the Club's deed restriction provides that no \"structure of any kind shall be erected closer than 35 feet to the Oceanfront side.\" However, Houseworth testified that the building approval process was handled in a separate committee, not by the Board, and that he was unaware how the committee defined \"structure.\" Plaintiffs failed to show that the \"structure\" rule is being applied differently to members who are not on the Board. Moreover, a suit challenging Houseworth's deck was dismissed with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Fifth, plaintiffs argued Board members did not pay Club dues. However, Houseworth testified that he was aware of Board members not paying dues prior to his becoming Board president in January 2013, but he immediately put a stop to that practice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   As the trial court noted, none of these alleged acts of self-dealing have any nexus to the rule changes plaintiffs are challenging. To overcome the business judgment rule, a plaintiff must show that \"the challenged [ ] actions\" constitute \"impermissible self-dealing.\"\n   <em>\n    Seidman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4149004\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/205/150/#p175\">\n    205 N.J. at 177\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4149004\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/205/150/#p175\">\n    14 A.3d 36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

However, Gemma not only referred to the documents governing the Club but also reviewed New Jersey case law relevant to the enforceability of private restrictive covenants in the context of a community scheme. Gemma also referenced FEMA requirements. Experts can rely on legal standards pertinent to their profession.\n   <em>\n    Costantino v.

Considering the Club's governing documents and its regulations in light of those standards was an appropriate topic for a professional planner, and not a \"common knowledge\" topic a lay person could address.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   V.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Plaintiff also argues that the Board made procedural errors. However, showing an error, particularly unrelated errors, does not\n   show the Board's challenged\n   actions were \" 'fraudulent, self-dealing or unconscionable.' \"\n   <em>\n    Seidman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4149004\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/205/150/#p175\">\n    205 N.J. at 175\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4149004\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/205/150/#p175\">\n    14 A.3d 36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   First, plaintiffs argue that the Board secretary failed to print and send the members notice of changes in rules and regulations \"no later than 30 days after the same has been enacted,\" as mandated by the Club's bylaws. Plaintiffs cite Houseworth's deposition where he stated that circulation was delayed \"[b]ecause it's a volunteer job, and some people lack urgency.\" However, Houseworth's candid response did not show bad faith on the part of the Board, especially in light of his testimony that he was presently addressing the issue. Moreover, Levine testified that although the rule changes were not initially mailed, they were \"communicated via email blasts and posting on the website.\" Plaintiffs did not challenge that the rule changes were published electronically in a timely fashion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Second, plaintiffs claimed the Board tried to stifle dissent through an amendment to the Club's bylaws provided that a Board member who institutes litigation against the Club is suspended from the Board during the litigation. However, the amendment to the bylaws was adopted by the membership of the Club, not the Board. Plaintiffs have not shown the members' action was impermissible, let alone that it showed bad faith by the Board.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Third, plaintiffs argue that the Board violated the New Jersey Planned Real Estate Development Full Disclosure Act (PREDFDA), N.J.S.A. 45:22A-21 to -56, by failing to offer alternative dispute resolution (ADR). However, the Board adopted a resolution offering ADR on June 4, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Finally, plaintiffs note \"[t]he PREDFDA statute provides additional protections.\" A 1993 amendment to PREDFDA added that: \"The bylaws of the association, which shall initially be recorded with the master deed shall include ... [a] requirement that all meetings of the executive board, except conference or working sessions at which no binding votes are to be taken, shall\n   be open to attendance by all association members[.]\" N.J.S.A. 45:22A-46, -46(a). Plaintiffs argue they were not \"permitted to attend board meetings, where the rules were adopted.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   However, plaintiffs raised no such claim in their complaint. Their statement of material facts and Alloco's certification alleged the Board never permitted members to be present when it voted on rules concerning construction until the June 4, 2016 meeting, but there is no mention of that claim or PREDFDA in their oral argument to the trial court on summary judgment. The court's opinion does not mention that claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   It is well-settled that New Jersey \"appellate courts will decline to consider questions or issues not properly presented to the trial court when an opportunity for such a presentation is available unless the questions so raised on appeal go to the jurisdiction of the trial court or concern matters of great public interest.\"\n   <em>\n    Selective Ins.
