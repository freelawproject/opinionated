Because we are convinced the court correctly determined the complaint should be dismissed because plaintiff agreed to arbitrate her claims, we affirm but modify the court's order to permit plaintiff to pursue her punitive damages claims in arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In September 2015, Bergen Logistics hired plaintiff as a human resources generalist. Oliver was Bergen Logistics's Human Resources Director and plaintiff's immediate supervisor. He terminated plaintiff's employment on December 30, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In an April 2017 Law Division complaint, plaintiff alleged Oliver sexually harassed her and created a sexually hostile work environment during her employment. She also alleged that after she objected to his conduct and sexual advances, he retaliated against her and terminated her employment. She asserted causes of action against Bergen Logistics and Oliver under the New Jersey Law Against Discrimination (LAD), N.J.S.A. 10:5-1 to -49, and for intentional infliction of emotional distress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Defendants moved to dismiss the complaint, asserting plaintiff was obligated to arbitrate her claims pursuant to the arbitration agreement she signed when hired\n   in September 2015. In support of their motion, defendants relied on the agreement, which refers to plaintiff as \"you\" and Bergen Logistics as the \"Company, and provides in pertinent part that \"[a]s an express condition of\" plaintiff's \"hiring\" and \"continu[ed]\" employment by Bergen Logistics she agreed:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   (i) all (past, present and future) disputes, controversies and claims of any nature (whether under federal, state or local laws and whether based on contract, tort, common law, statute ...) arising out of, involving, affecting or related in any way to your ... employment ... and/or termination of employment by or from Company, the conditions of your employment, or any act or omission of Company or Company's other employees shall be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration before the American Arbitration Association ....

Plaintiff also asserted the agreement was unenforceable because she was unable to read it when it was presented, it was not written in plain language and she did not read it before signing it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   After hearing argument, the court issued a written opinion finding plaintiff knowingly signed the agreement, and that it contained an unambiguous waiver of claims for \"punitive and exemplary damages.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court found plaintiff's hiring and continued employment provided consideration for the agreement, which covered the claims asserted in the complaint,\n   was binding and required submission of her claims to arbitration. The court entered an order dismissing the complaint. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Plaintiff first contends the court erred by dismissing the complaint because the arbitration agreement's punitive damages\n   waiver violates the public policy underlying the LAD, thereby rendering the agreement unenforceable.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Bergen Logistics and Oliver contend punitive damages waivers do not violate public policy and therefore there is no basis to void plaintiff's obligation to arbitrate her claims under the agreement's plain language.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   We review the court's order dismissing the complaint de novo because it is founded on a determination of a question of law - the validity of the arbitration agreement.\n   <em>\n    Barr v.
