Strine, Jr., Chief Justice\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   On June 19, 2018, the appellant filed a notice of appeal from a Superior Court order sentencing him for a violation of probation. The Chief Deputy Clerk directed the appellant to pay the filing fee or file a motion to proceed\n   <em>\n    in forma pauperis\n   </em>\n   by July 5, 2018. After the appellant failed to take either action, the Chief Deputy Clerk issued a notice, on July 6, 2018, directing the appellant to show cause why this appeal should not be dismissed for his failure to pay the filing fee or file a motion to proceed\n   <em>\n    in forma pauperis\n   </em>\n   . The appellant received the notice to show cause by July 11, 2018, but has not responded within the required ten-day period, paid the filing fee, or filed a motion to proceed\n   <em>\n    in forma pauperis\n   </em>\n   . Dismissal of this appeal is therefore deemed to be unopposed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   NOW, THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, under Supreme Court Rules 3(b)(2) and 29(b), that this appeal is DISMISSED.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
