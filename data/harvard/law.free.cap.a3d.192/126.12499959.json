After careful review, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   We adopt the following statement of facts from the trial court opinion, which in turn is supported by the record.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Trial Court Op. (TCO), 3/30/2017, at 1-5. On October 8, 2016, at approximately 2:12\n   a.m., Altoona Police Department patrolmen Joseph Detwiler and Derek Tardive responded to a noise complaint \"in a high crime area.\" No information or description was given regarding any person involved in the noise complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   At the location, officers observed Appellee and another man conversing with two women in a car. Appellee had his hand in his pocket. Although Appellee and his companion were not inside the building that was the address of the complaint, because officers were concerned that \"if they responded to the noise complaint first, the men would not be there when they got outside,\" they approached Appellee.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Notes of Testimony (N.T.), 2/6/17, at 12. Officer Detwiler ordered Appellee to remove his hand from his pocket. Officer Tardive ordered Appellee to put his hands on his head and stated that he would be conducting a pat-down search.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Rather than comply, Appellee immediately fled on foot. Subsequent to a foot chase, the officers recovered Appellee's shoe and near the shoe, four bags of a white powdery substance, later identified as cocaine. Appellee was arrested and subsequently charged with possession with intent to deliver a controlled substance (\"PWID\"), resisting arrest, escape, and disorderly conduct.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In November 2016, Appellee filed a suppression motion, arguing that police officers did not have reasonable suspicion to justify their initial attempt to stop and frisk Appellee based upon his mere presence in a high crime area and the fact that he had his hand in his pocket. In February 2017, the suppression court convened a hearing at which Officer Detwiler testified, and at which Officer Tardive's preliminary hearing testimony was read into the record. On March 17, 2017, the suppression court granted the order, finding that Appellee was subjected to an unlawful investigative detention as the officers lacked reasonable suspicion that criminal activity was afoot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Commonwealth timely appealed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Both the Commonwealth and the court have complied with Pa.R.A.P. 1925(a)-(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On appeal, the Commonwealth raises the following issues for our review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   1. Whether the suppression court erred in concluding that Officers Detwiler and [Tardive], viewed from the standpoint of an objective reasonable police officer, did not possess reasonable suspicion that criminal activity may be afoot and that Appellee may be armed and dangerous.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   2. Whether the suppression court erred in suppressing controlled substances that were not found pursuant to a search of defendant, but were discarded by Appellee before or during his struggle with police.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Commonwealth's Brief at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   First, the Commonwealth contends that the court erred in concluding that officers did not possess reasonable suspicion that criminal activity may be afoot and that Appellant was armed and dangerous.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Commw. Brief at 7-8. The Commonwealth contends that the following facts support its argument and subsequent investigatory\n   stop: 1) that the time of the encounter was 2:00 a.m.; 2) the area was a high crime area; 3) Appellee's interactions with the vehicle were consistent with drug transactions; 4) Appellee \"shoved his hand into his pocket when he made eye contact with the officers.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 9-10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   When reviewing the grant of a suppression motion,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   we must determine whether the record supports the trial court's factual findings and whether the legal conclusions drawn from those facts are correct. We may only consider evidence presented at the suppression hearing. In addition, because the defendant prevailed on this issue before the suppression court, we consider only the defendant's evidence and so much of the Commonwealth's evidence as remains uncontradicted when read in the context of the record as a whole. We may reverse only if the legal conclusions drawn from the facts are in error.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth v.

Although the description of the clothing was not exact, it was reasonably close given the late hour.

Second, the report in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Thomas\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   was of a man with a gun, a matter in which officers would reasonably fear for their safety upon seeing a man with his hands in his pockets.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 80. In the instant case, officers were responding to a noise complaint, with no reports of weapons.

I write separately to respond to President Judge Emeritus Stevens's dissent, and to note my view that our opinion today is limited to the facts. I would not foreclose\n   a finding that a command to remove hands is constitutionally reasonable even in the absence of reasonable suspicion. My analysis follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Judge Stevens states that the police officers \"had every right to approach and question Appellee, especially at 2 a.m., in a high crime area.\" Dissenting Opinion at 137. That is accurate, but misleading as it fails to consider Appellee's rights. An officer is free to approach and ask questions. \"Law enforcement officers do not violate the Fourth Amendment's prohibition of unreasonable seizures merely by approaching individuals on the street or in other public places and putting questions to them if they are willing to listen.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     United States v. Drayton\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1254966\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/536/194/#p200\">\n    536 U.S. 194\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 200,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1254966\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/536/194/#p200\">\n    122 S.Ct. 2105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1254966\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/536/194/#p200\">\n    153 L.Ed.2d 242\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2002) (citations omitted). The dissent ignores the fact that the flip side of that doctrine is that the citizen can simply decline the invitation. \"If a reasonable person would feel free to terminate the encounter, then he or she has not been seized.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1254966\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/536/194/#p200\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Thus, while officers had the right to approach Appellee and ask him to remove his hands, Appellee had the right to decline the request under the mere encounter framework.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Next, Judge Stevens errs by failing to recognize that Appellee was not\n   <strong>\n    asked\n   </strong>\n   to remove his hands, he was\n   <strong>\n    ordered\n   </strong>\n   to do so. The dissent maintains that Appellee was not seized when told to show his hands, and opines that, for purposes of ensuring the officers' safety, Appellee was required to honor the request. \"[T]he record shows when the officers first approached Appellee on foot, they asked Appellee to take his hand from his pocket\n   <em>\n    for their safety\n   </em>\n   . At this point, the interaction between Appellee and the officers remained a mere encounter, and the officer's request to see Appellee's hands did not turn the encounter into an investigative detention.\" Dissenting Opinion at 139 (emphasis in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   I cannot agree that this interaction was a mere encounter. According to Judge Stevens, the officers merely asked Appellee to show his hands. When Appellee failed to do so, his failure to abide by these requests justified the frisk. \"Appellee's refusal to comply with the officer's request to refrain from concealing his hands in his pocket gave the officer reason to believe that Appellee could have a weapon and justified the subsequent protective frisk.\" Dissenting Opinion at 140. This analysis falls apart once one considers, under mere encounter principles, that Appellee was not obligated to submit to the show of authority. How, then, does the refusal to comply create reasonable suspicion that Appellee was armed and dangerous? The dissent appears to embrace the dangerous view, espoused by the Commonwealth, that an individual with nothing to hide will simply obey the authorities.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   Appellee's refusal to submit to a simple request by Ptlm. Detwiler to remove his hands, is certainly a factor that a reasonable police officer may consider when determining whether to demand a person submit to a \"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Terry\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   frisk\". Had Appellee simply removed his hand, Ptlm. Detwiler may have been able to deal with the situation differently.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Commonwealth's brief at 7 n.1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The dissent continues:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   When an individual refuses to comply with a reasonable request to remove his hands from his pocket and the circumstances lead an officer to believe that the individual is armed and dangerous, the police officer should have the right to do a brief pat-down search of that individual for the\n   <em>\n    police officer's personal\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    safety.\n   </em>\n   We should not create a policy that says otherwise.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Dissenting opinion at 140.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Respectfully, this case is not about creating policies, it is about applying the Fourth Amendment, and I do not find support in the law for that conclusion. With respect to frisks, it is well-settled that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   Warrantless searches and seizures (such as occurred in this case) are unreasonable\n   <em>\n    per se,\n   </em>\n   unless conducted pursuant to specifically established and well-delineated exceptions to the warrant requirement. One such exception, the\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Terry\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   \"stop and frisk,\" permits a police officer to briefly detain a citizen for investigatory purposes if the officer observes unusual conduct which leads him to reasonably conclude, in light of his experience, that criminal activity may be afoot.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Terry\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   further held that when an officer is justified in believing that the individual whose suspicious behavior he is investigating at close range is armed and presently dangerous to the officer or to others the officer may conduct a pat down search to determine whether the person is in fact carrying a weapon. The purpose of this limited search is not to discover evidence of crime, but to allow the officer to pursue his investigation without fear of violence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth v.

On what grounds did the officer believe that Appellee, who was not under investigation for any criminal activity, was armed and dangerous? Aside from the refusal to submit to authority, I discern no reason. Judge Stevens does not grapple with that question, and states that the officer should be permitted to conduct a frisk due to the failure to comply with the request. Therefore, the dissent appears to promulgate a\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   rule that an officer may approach any citizen for any reason, and demand to see their hands. The result of noncompliance is an invasive pat-down search. That rule cannot be squared with precedent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   As the majority noted, this decision is largely limited to this \"fact-specific inquiry[.]\" Majority opinion at 130.

Therefore, Enslin contends that the district court should have suppressed the gun that the marshals saw when Enslin complied with their order. To address this claim, we must determine whether the marshals' order constituted a seizure under the Fourth Amendment and, if so, whether it was nonetheless reasonable under the circumstances. We answer both inquiries in the affirmative.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n    <em>\n     The show hands order constituted a seizure under the Fourth Amendment.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   The Government argues that the marshals' order to Enslin to show his hands did not constitute a seizure pursuant to the Fourth Amendment. We disagree. \"The Fourth Amendment applies to all seizures of the person, including seizures that involve only a brief detention short of traditional arrest.\" The appropriate inquiry is whether the marshals' order \"in some way restrain[ed]\" Enslin's liberty such that a reasonable person under the circumstances would not have felt free to disregard the order. Even if the official interference with an individual's liberty is brief, provided that it is some sort of \"meaningful interference ... with an individual's freedom of movement,\" it constitutes a seizure.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   We think that the show hands order was a \"meaningful interference\" with Enslin's freedom. He had his hands covered and two armed marshals ordered him to reveal his hands. A reasonable person in Enslin's situation would not have felt free to ignore the request of the marshals, who likely had their hands on their weapons when they gave the order. Therefore, the marshals' order to Enslin to show his hands constituted a seizure within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n    <em>\n     The show hands order did not violate the Fourth Amendment because it was not an\n    </em>\n    unreasonable\n    <em>\n     seizure.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   Our conclusion that the show hands order was a seizure does not end the inquiry, \"[f]or the Fourth Amendment does not proscribe all searches and seizures, but only those that are unreasonable.\" The marshals' order to Enslin to show his hands, although technically a seizure, does not violate the Fourth Amendment because it was not an unreasonable seizure under the circumstances. The obligation placed upon Enslin to reveal his hands for officer safety during the search for a fugitive was\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   and thus constitutionally reasonable.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   Any inquiry into the reasonableness of a seizure requires \"a careful balancing of the nature and quality of the intrusion on the individual's Fourth Amendment interests against the countervailing governmental interests at stake.\" In this case, that balance affirmatively favors the Government's interest in officer safety, leading us to conclude that the marshals' order was constitutional. On Enslin's side of the balance, requiring an individual to reveal his hands does force him to show a part of his person that was otherwise concealed. However, the nature and quality of the intrusion are minimal.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9140693\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/327/788/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9140693\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/327/788/\">\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </strong>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9140693\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/327/788/\">\n    at 795-96\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (footnotes omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   I find this analysis compelling.

Herein, Appellee was merely on the street. While I agree that the fact the encounter occurred at 2:00 a.m. in a high crime area is pertinent to the analysis, the fact is that the officers were responding to a simple noise complaint.

At this point, the interaction between Appellee and the officers remained a mere encounter, and the officer's request to see Appellee's hands did not turn the encounter into an investigative detention.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Thomas\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ;\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Coleman\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ;\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Blair\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Thereafter, Appellee refused to comply with officers' request to remove his hand from his pocket. This suspicious behavior, along with the fact that the officers had encountered Appellee at approximately 2 a.m. in a high crime area, demonstrates that the officers were justified in attempting to perform a pat-down of Appellee\n   <em>\n    for their personal safety\n   </em>\n   as they reasonably believed that Appellee was armed and dangerous.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Thomas\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ;\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Hall\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <em>\n    ,\n    <strong>\n     supra\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Moreover, I cannot agree with the Majority's assertion that the Officer Detwiler had no right to command Appellee to stop concealing his hand as \"[a]ny potential danger in the interaction initiated by police was manufactured by Officer Detwiler himself.\" Majority, at 131. The Majority's position is unsupported by the aforementioned precedent, and its reliance on this Court's decision in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Carter\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   is misplaced. In\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Carter\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , the officer pulled his firearm on the appellee and told him to remove his hand from his pocket; however, the officer admitted on cross-examination that he had initially told the defendant to place his hand in his pocket. This Court questioned the validity of the officer's belief that the defendant was armed and dangerous:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-109\">\n   Since it was the officer who told Appellee to put his hand in his pocket, we find it absurd that the officer would then argue that he became concerned for his safety when Appellee complied with his directive. A police officer cannot for instance, ask an individual to pick up a gun lying on the floor, and then claim that he was afraid for his safety because the individual picked up the gun. A police officer is not permitted to create a dangerous situation and then use the self-created danger as the basis for escalating an encounter into a seizure.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Carter\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <em>\n    ,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9493203\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/779/591/#p594\">\n    779 A.2d at 594\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This Court found that the officer escalated the situation into an investigative detention when he reached for his weapon and ordered the appellee to show his hands.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Moreover, the\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Carter\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   panel went on to clarify that its conclusion would have been different had the appellee put his hand in his pocket without being prompted by the officer. The\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Carter\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   panel explained that the officer's response in reaching for his side arm and ordering the appellee to show his hands would not have escalated\n   the encounter into an investigative detention as the officer would have reasonably feared for his safety as the appellee could have been retrieving a weapon from his pocket.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   There is nothing in the record in the instant case to suggest the police officers directed Appellee to put his hands in his pockets. Thus, the decision in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Carter\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   does not support the Majority's conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   In this same manner, I disagree with the Majority's suggestion that an officer has no right to ask an individual to remove his hands from his pockets without escalating an interaction from a mere encounter to an investigative detention. Permitting an officer to request that an individual not conceal his hands during an interaction promotes officer safety and allows the officer to pursue the interaction with less apprehension of violence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   When an individual refuses to comply with a reasonable request to remove his hands from his pocket and the circumstances lead an officer to believe that the individual is armed and dangerous, the police officer should have the right to do a brief pat-down search of that individual for the\n   <em>\n    police officer's personal safety.\n   </em>\n   We should not create a policy that says otherwise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   As a result, consistent with the aforementioned precedent, Appellee's refusal to comply with the officer's request to refrain from concealing his hands in his pocket gave the officer reason to believe that Appellee could have a weapon and justified the subsequent protective frisk.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Further, if this Court were to uphold the constitutionality of the frisk of Appellant's person, the officers were also justified in pursuing Appellee after he fled the scene. Our courts have held that a police officer's pursuit of a fleeing suspect constitutes a seizure under Article 1, Section 8 of the Pennsylvania Constitution, which provides broader protection than the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth v.
