Because they bear some relation, I discuss both topics below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Dominic Burno has challenged the sufficiency of the evidence to support his conviction for the crime of criminal trespass, which is defined in relevant part as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    (a) Buildings and occupied structures.--\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   (1) A person commits an offense if, knowing that he is not licensed or privileged to do so, he:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   (i) enters, gains entry by subterfuge or surreptitiously remains in any building or occupied structure or separately secured or occupied portion thereof; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   (ii) breaks into any building or occupied structure or separately secured or occupied portion thereof.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3503.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Burno contends that he and several others were parties to an oral lease with Donna Rayson-Hutchinson, which established his legal tenancy in the residential property as to which he was convicted of trespass. As a tenant, he argues, he was licensed and/or privileged to occupy the property, precluding the jury from concluding that he knew that he had no such license or privilege. Put simply, if Burno had license or privilege, then, as a matter of both law and common sense, no jury could convict him of trespass.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth v.

Accordingly, Burno could not be convicted of criminal trespass, and could be removed from the property only pursuant to the protections of the Landlord\n   and Tenant Act of 1951, 68 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 250.101,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (\"LTA\"),\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   which prescribes a rigorous and exclusive procedure for the eviction of a tenant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Burno's Petition for Allowance of Appeal reflected this understanding of his argument. As presented, Burno's issue presupposes his legal tenancy in the property. Specifically, he sought, and this Court granted, allowance of appeal as to the following question, taken verbatim from his Petition for Allowance of Appeal:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   Whether the Superior Court erred in concluding that the evidence was sufficient to convict [Burno] of criminal trespass,\n   <em>\n    where the evidence showed that [Burno] was a tenant of the residence at issue\n   </em>\n   and had not been properly evicted pursuant to the [LTA] prior to the criminal action having been filed against him?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth v.

Specifically, in exchange for her tenancy in the home, Hoffman agreed to cover a certain number of Hutchinson's mortgage payments and perform certain repairs on the property. The discussions in question occurred solely between Hutchinson and Hoffman. Moreover, when the agreement soured, Hutchinson dealt solely with Hoffman, and Hoffman characterized the obligations in lieu of rent as her own. However, several other people were present for the property walk-through and when the oral agreement was struck following Hutchinson's and Hoffman's negotiation, including Burno (Hoffman's boyfriend at the time) and Chris Hodges. Hutchinson undisputedly understood that they and others intended to live in the home with Hoffman.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The difficulty that arises upon review of the record, performed with due regard to our deferential standard of review,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   is that Burno's putative legal tenancy cannot be taken as given. While the record certainly enabled a jury to find factual predicates that would support a judicial finding that Burno was a party to an oral lease with the concomitant right to possess the property, the record did not compel the jury to do so. Consequently, our standard of review obligates us to assume that the jury did not share Burno's view of his legal relationship with Hutchinson.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \"[A] lease is in the nature of a contract and is to be controlled by principles of contract law.\"\n   <em>\n    Pugh v.

Accordingly, we must focus solely upon the evidence that militates in favor of a finding that Burno had no license or privilege to the property at the relevant time. This entails construing the evidence in favor of finding no understanding, no\n   <em>\n    quid pro quo\n   </em>\n   , between Hutchinson and Burno that would support the legal conclusion that they intended to enter, or by conduct entered, into a legally binding oral lease supported by an offer, an acceptance, and an exchange of consideration-that their intent to be bound was demonstrated in their words or deeds.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pulse Techs., Inc. v.

The testimony regarding the facts and circumstances of the agreement pursuant to which the living arrangement at issue came to be were consistent with the conclusion that the oral lease negotiated by Hutchinson and Hoffman vested Burno with a legal tenancy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Unfortunately for Burno, the testimony also was consistent with the contrary conclusion-that only Hutchinson and Hoffman agreed to the terms of the lease as asserted herein, notwithstanding Hutchinson's foreknowledge that Hoffman would allow others to live with her in the residence under the umbrella of\n   <em>\n    her\n   </em>\n   lease agreement with Hutchinson.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Furthermore, although Burno's exclusive reliance upon the assumed\n   premise of tenancy renders this issue moot, the testimony also provided ample basis for a jury to conclude that, not only was Burno not licensed or privileged to remain on the property after Hoffman and the others left, but he\n   <em>\n    knew\n   </em>\n   that he lacked such license or privilege.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   These discrepancies necessarily render any legal opinion we issue on a question that assumes Burno's legal tenancy provisional and advisory. However, it is not our practice to render such opinions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Consequently, I agree with my fellow Justices that we granted review improvidently, because the question we sought to consider depends upon a premise that our standard of review precludes us from accepting as true, rendering any putative decision hypothetical at best.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   I write separately because I find it regrettable that this circumstance precludes us from reaching a question of importance to many residential renters in Pennsylvania. The law recognizes the home as sacrosanct, an overarching principle evident in everything from the law governing search and seizure\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   to mortgage foreclosure\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   to eviction. In the realm of residential leases, in particular, the law, both statutory and common, long has resisted landlord \"self-help\" in its multifarious forms.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Many of these appeared in this case-Hutchinson's unilateral cancellation of essential utility services, her efforts to secure the residence against Burno's entry, and, of course, her engagement of the criminal justice system.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   To enshrine this principle, the General Assembly long ago implemented\n   the time-consuming and demanding eviction procedure prescribed by the LTA, which undisputedly applies when a legal tenancy is established.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   68 P.S. \u00a7 250.602 (\"It is intended that this act shall furnish a complete and exclusive system in itself.\"). Those protections must not be discarded lightly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Concurring and dissenting below in this case, President Judge Emeritus Bender observed, and I agree, that \"[e]viction cases ... should be brought by aggrieved landlords in the appropriate civil forum, as opposed to burdening and abusing the criminal justice system.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth v. Burno\n   </em>\n   , 1572 MDA 2015,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20838233\">\n    2017 WL 838233\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7 (Pa. Super. Mar. 3, 2017) (Bender, P.J.E., concurring and dissenting). But it is not just the criminal justice system that is abused. If criminal trespass is allowed to displace the LTA in close cases, it signals to landlords\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   law enforcement authorities that resort to the Crimes Code presents a ready alternative to engaging the LTA's more laborious, time-consuming process, with potentially injurious consequences for tenants who are legally entitled to the LTA's protections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The LTA eviction process provides an important bulwark against precipitous and mis- or malfeasant evictions. Consequently, it is imperative that Pennsylvania law enforcement authorities and courts remain vigilant for such abuses, examining criminal prosecutions arising from circumstances similar to these with great skepticism, and that they err in favor of the LTA's protections wherever they may apply.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    Act of April 6, 1951, P.L. 69, art I, \u00a7 101.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    68 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 250.501, 502, 503 ;\n    <em>\n     see generally\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Nellom v.
