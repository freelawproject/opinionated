We shall hold that in deciding whether to grant a stay, the court must balance the plaintiff's Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination and Article 19 right of access to the courts against the defendant's interest in a timely resolution of the claims against him. A stay should be granted to protect the plaintiff's constitutional rights unless it will cause undue prejudice to the civil defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In the Circuit Court for Prince George's County, Kristi Heffington (\"Kristi\") and her husband, Matthew Heffington (\"Matthew\"), the appellants, brought a tort action against Kristi's former employer, Ronald F. Moser, D.D.S, P.A. (\"the Practice\"), Ronald F. Moser, D.D.S. (\"Dr. Moser\"), and Dr. Moser's wife, Anne M. Moser (\"Anne\"), the appellees (\"the civil suit\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Heffingtons' tort claims all were based on allegedly false statements the Mosers made to the police, to the Practice's insurer, and to others that Kristi had stolen money from the Practice and had engaged in identity fraud while employed there.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   While the civil suit was pending, Kristi was indicted by a grand jury in the Circuit Court for Prince George's County, Case No. CT170240X, for one count of theft scheme and four counts of identity fraud (\"the criminal case\"). Originally, the trial in the criminal case was scheduled to commence before the assigned trial date in the civil case. Later, upon the State's request, the criminal case trial date was postponed. The new trial date for the criminal case was after the trial date in the\n   civil suit. The Heffingtons filed a motion to stay the civil suit pending disposition of the criminal case, arguing that to protect herself in the criminal case, Kristi would be invoking\n   the Fifth Amendment in the civil suit and, therefore, would be unavailable to testify on her own behalf. After a hearing, the court denied the motion to stay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   As we shall explain in detail below, on the first day of trial in the civil suit, the Heffingtons moved for a mistrial, which was denied, and rested without putting on evidence. The circuit court granted judgment in favor of the Mosers and the Practice on all counts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Heffingtons noted this appeal, asking whether the circuit court abused its discretion by denying their motion to stay the civil suit. For the following reasons, we answer that question in the affirmative. We shall vacate the judgment of the circuit court and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Dr. Moser owns and operates the Practice, which is located in Bowie. At the relevant time, Anne was working there as a dental hygienist. Kristi was hired by the Practice in June 2008. In 2010 she became the office manager. In that capacity, she was responsible for depositing all cash and checks in the Practice's business account, balancing the daily transactions, and providing Dr. Moser a daily report on revenue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On April 15, 2015, Dr. Moser fired Kristi for stealing money from the Practice. Specifically, Kristi was accused of using the Visa terminal at the Practice to charge and later refund charges on medical credit cards she obtained in her name and in the names of family members, without their knowledge or consent. The day he fired Kristi, Dr. Moser reported Kristi's thefts to the City of Bowie Police Department and to CNA, the Practice's liability insurer. Five days later, Kristi's cousin, Randall Tracey (\"Randall\"), reported to the Anne Arundel County Police Department that Kristi had stolen his son Randy's identity and used it to apply for a medical credit card.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Randall also reported that in 2013 Kristi had stolen his identity and had used it to apply for a $10,000 medical loan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On March 21, 2016, the Heffingtons filed the civil suit that gives rise to this appeal. They alleged that in December 2013 Anne had told Kristi, in confidence, that she was having an affair and that in January 2015 Kristi had told Dr. Moser about Anne's affair. They further alleged that Dr. Moser and Anne then \"conspired to develop a scheme to disparage [Kristi's] reputation, and to cause injury to her financial, mental, psychological, emotional, and personal well-being, as well as interfere with her own standing as an employee in the dental community.\" In furtherance of that conspiracy, the Mosers falsely reported to the police that Kristi had stolen over $3,000 from the Practice; filed a false insurance claim asserting that Kristi had stolen over $100,000 from the Practice; filed a civil action in the District Court of Maryland for Anne Arundel County falsely alleging that Kristi had wrongfully refused to repay a $5,000 loan from Dr. Moser; and called Randall, who was Matthew's employer, and made false allegations about Kristi and false allegations that Matthew had participated in Kristi's alleged theft scheme.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Kristi stated claims against the Mosers, individually, and the Practice for defamation\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   (Counts I &amp; II); malicious use of process (Counts III &amp; IV); and tortious interference with prospective business advantage (Counts V &amp; VI). Matthew stated claims against the Mosers, individually, and the Practice for defamation\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   (Counts IX &amp; X) and tortious interference with prospective advantage (Counts VII and VIII). They both stated a claim against the Mosers and the Practice for civil conspiracy (Count XI). In each count, they sought compensatory and punitive damages in excess of $75,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On August 16, 2016, the court entered a scheduling order, setting the case in for a four-day trial from June 19-22, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Mosers noted Kristi's deposition, and, on November 14,\n   2016, Kristi was deposed for seven hours.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   She testified that three weeks before she was fired, Randall's ex-wife contacted her via Facebook messenger and asked her about an issue with Randy's credit report. That is how she learned that she was being accused of stealing Randy's identity. Then, in May 2015, she learned the police were investigating her for identity theft. In answers to questions, she spoke about obtaining medical credit cards in her own name and in the names of various family members; transactions using those credit cards, including refunds of charges she had made from the office Visa terminal; loans Dr. Moser extended to her; and dental insurance claims she had made on behalf of her aunt, who never was a patient of the Practice. She denied any wrongdoing, claiming that the financial transactions were proper and were made with the consent of her family members and with Dr. Moser's knowledge and consent. Kristi did not invoke her Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination during the deposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On February 21, 2017, Kristi was indicted on one count of theft scheme over $10,000, but less than $100,000, and four counts of identity fraud-two pertaining to Randall and two pertaining to her brother's girlfriend. The offense dates all are April 15, 2015, and the crimes are based on misconduct by Kristi in her capacity as the office manager for the Practice. The trial in the criminal case was scheduled to commence on June 8, 2017, roughly two weeks before the trial date in the civil suit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Meanwhile, discovery continued in the civil suit. On May 2, 2017, the parties attended mediation, which was unsuccessful. According to the Heffingtons, at the mediation their attorney advised the Mosers' attorney that he might file a motion to stay the civil suit until the criminal case was resolved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On June 7, 2017, at the State's request, the trial date in the criminal case was postponed until August 23, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Eight days later, the Heffingtons filed a motion to stay the civil suit pending the resolution of the criminal case. They asserted that \"[a]ny testimony provided by ... Kristi ... in the [civil suit] will implicate her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination and she will be unable to testify and present her case.\" They pointed out that because there is a one-year statute of limitations for defamation,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Md. Code (1974, 2013 Repl. Vol.), section 5-105 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (\"CJP\"), they had had no choice but to file suit in 2016. They analogized their circumstances to two cases in which a stay of a civil action, or of particular proceedings in a civil action, was sought by a defendant pending resolution of related criminal charges against him.\n   <em>\n    In re Mid-Atlantic Toyota Antitrust Litigation\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3942622\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/92/358/\">\n    92 F.R.D. 358\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D. Md. 1981) ; and\n   <em>\n    In re Royal Ahold N.V. Securities &amp; ERISA Litigation\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1279239\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/220/246/\">\n    220 F.R.D. 246\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D. Md. 2004). Referencing those cases, the Heffingtons argued that a stay would not burden them or the Mosers and would be convenient for the court because, if Kristi were to be convicted in the criminal case, the civil suit \"will probably be dismissed.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Mosers filed an opposition to the motion to stay. They argued that the motion was untimely, having been filed just six days prior to trial, and that, in any event, Kristi had waived her Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination\n   by testifying in deposition and engaging in discovery after she was indicted. They further argued that the Fifth Amendment is a shield and may not be used by a civil plaintiff as a sword to delay the resolution of her action pending the resolution of a related criminal action. They maintained that Kristi had been free not to file suit, could dismiss her suit, could attempt to prove her case through other evidence, or could take the stand and invoke the privilege. They argued that they had \"an important interest in having their case tried expeditiously[,]\" and would be prejudiced by a stay that lasted until the conclusion of the criminal case, whenever that might be.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On June 15, 2017, the court held a hearing on the motion to stay. The Heffingtons' lawyer requested a \"short stay just to\n   let the criminal trial get out of the way,\" explaining that if the stay were not granted, Kristi \"would invoke her Fifth [Amendment privilege and the Heffingtons would] have no case\" to put on. Counsel for the Mosers and the Practice responded that, given the likelihood of additional continuances in the criminal case and an appeal if Kristi were to be convicted, any stay would not be \"short\" and that they had incurred significant costs preparing for trial and should not be forced to delay defending themselves against the civil suit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   At the conclusion of argument, the court denied the motion to stay, opining:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   I think there is a good likelihood that more likely so than not that there may be a finding that [Kristi] ... may have waived her Fifth Amendment privilege to a certain extent. I haven't looked at the depositions. I don't know what the testimony is, but there's no dispute that she did give a deposition in this matter regarding the issue - surrounding the issues in this case, and that to a certain extent, from what I hear from counsel, the allegations in this case relate somewhat to the allegations in the criminal case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   There is no guarantee when the criminal case is going to go forward when scheduled. I think the criminal case was scheduled previously in this matter and got continued. I have the criminal case here. It doesn't look like this criminal case is specially assigned to any judge, so there is extensive discovery, extensive documents in this case that may make this case go beyond the usual two- or three-day trial. That may continue it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   I just say all this to say you don't have a guarantee that the [criminal] case is going to go forward on the date that it is currently assigned. This is a civil case and it could be continued. The civil case could be bumped further and further and further along. I do find that the motion is filed somewhat late since you knew that she was indicted months ago.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   For those reasons and the extensive discovery and preparation on the part of the defendant[s], just to note you were\n   just in pretrial where defense counsel noted that as far as the documents they have in this case for exhibits, it's over a hundred documents in this matter. The civil case was specially assigned to this member of the bench. For those reasons, because there's no guarantee that the criminal case will go forward when ... it's supposed to happen, I'm going to deny the motion to stay in this case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   If [Kristi] does invoke her Fifth Amendment right in the civil case, a jury is able to take that evidence and draw reasonable inferences from that evidence. Those are things that she has to consider and I'm going to deny the motion to stay.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On June 19, 2017, the first day of trial, judgment was entered in favor of the Mosers. This timely appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, \"No person ... shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.\" U.S. Const.

First, this issue is not preserved for review because the Heffingtons acquiesced in the court's granting the motion for judgment against them. Second, if the issue is preserved, it lacks merit because Kristi waived her Fifth Amendment privilege by not actually taking the stand and invoking it at trial and by not invoking it at her deposition. And third, if the issue is preserved and the privilege was not waived, the court did not abuse its discretion by denying the motion to stay given that it was filed on the eve of trial and the criminal case could last for years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    a.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   We begin with the threshold matter of preservation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Trial commenced four days after the motion to stay was denied. At the outset, the Heffingtons' lawyer proposed a process to follow to \"protect [his] client's interests[,]\"\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   Kristi's Fifth Amendment right not to incriminate herself. A jury would be seated, opening statements would be waived, and he would proffer that Kristi was invoking her Fifth\n   Amendment right and that without her testimony the Heffingtons could not put on evidence to prove their case. He then would move for a mistrial, rest the plaintiffs' case, and the defense would move for judgment. Counsel for the parties agreed to shorten the process even more by waiving\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   and\n   simply seating the first six jurors from the venire panel. They further agreed that when the venire was brought into the courtroom the trial judge would inform them that they would not be hearing any evidence and that for \"procedural reason[s]\" the plaintiffs would rest, the defendants would make motions, the court would rule, and it would be a \"very short day.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The process proposed was followed by counsel for the Heffingtons, counsel for the Mosers, and the court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   As noted, the Mosers maintain that the Heffingtons failed to preserve their Fifth Amendment issue for review because they acquiesced in the court's granting the motion for judgment. Specifically, they argue that the Heffingtons should have presented evidence other than Kristi's testimony to prove their case and did not adequately explain why they could not do so. The Mosers assert that this case is similar to\n   <em>\n    Osztreicher v. Juanteguy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2027871\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/338/528/#p535\">\n    338 Md. 528\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 535,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2027871\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/338/528/#p535\">\n    659 A.2d 1278\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1995), in which the Court of Appeals held that when, after a trial court precluded a medical malpractice plaintiff from calling his preferred expert, the plaintiff elected not to go forward with evidence, resulting in a judgment against him, he had \"acquiesced in, if not consented to, the entry of that judgment.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The Mosers did not object to the process suggested by counsel for the Heffingtons; on the contrary, they participated in it. They expected that the Heffingtons would not be presenting any evidence and did not take the position that they should be required to or, as they now assert, that there was evidence other than Kristi's testimony that could serve as a sufficient substitute. Because they did not object, the issue was neither raised nor decided below and therefore was not preserved. Md. Rule 8-131(a). To the extent there was acquiescence, it was by the Mosers in the process the Heffingtons'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   lawyer proposed be followed, not by the Heffingtons in the judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   This case is unlike\n   <em>\n    Osztreicher v. Juanteguy\n   </em>\n   . There, on the first day of trial, one of the plaintiff's expert witnesses refused to testify because he did not want to reveal how much money he had earned from giving expert witness testimony. The plaintiff had identified another expert, however, and that expert was available to testify. The plaintiff's counsel did not want to call the available expert because he was retired, and counsel thought the jury would give less weight to his testimony for that reason. He elected not to put on any evidence, which resulted in an adverse judgment, to which the Court of Appeals held the plaintiff had acquiesced. In that situation, counsel for the plaintiff made a strategic decision not to present evidence that could have been presented; opposing counsel did not agree to that process; and no party's Fifth Amendment right was at stake. None of those circumstances apply here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    b.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    (1)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The Mosers maintain the Heffingtons waived their Fifth Amendment issue because Kristi did not actually take the stand and invoke the privilege.

To be sure, CBS also had \"important rights that must be respected.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1088. Consequently, Mr. Wehling did not have an \"absolute right to both his silence and his lawsuit.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The district court was required to balance\n   the competing interests, however, with dismissal only being appropriate when \"other, less burdensome, remedies would be an ineffective means of preventing unfairness to defendant.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The Fifth Circuit rejected the argument that a\n   <em>\n    defendant\n   </em>\n   who has been sued can raise the Fifth Amendment to protect against self-incrimination in a parallel criminal case but a\n   <em>\n    plaintiff\n   </em>\n   who has brought suit cannot. The \"plaintiff-defendant distinction\" rests on the theory that the plaintiff is a \"voluntary litigant,\" but \"[i]n most cases, however, a party 'voluntarily' becomes a plaintiff only because there is no other means of protecting legal rights.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1089 n.10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Because the district court gave no weight to Mr. Wehling's constitutional interests, reversal was required. The Fifth Circuit did not remand the case to the district court to engage in the proper balancing, however. Instead, it held that a proper balancing of rights \"tip[ped] in favor of [Mr.] Wehling,\" as a matter of law.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1088. Mr. Wehling had filed his civil suit on the final day before the one-year statute of limitations ran; sold his interest in the trade schools before then; and only was subject to potential criminal liability for another three years under the applicable statute of limitations. Thus, his request for a stay was not indefinite, but for a fixed period of time. Although a delay for potentially three years was inconvenient to CBS, that burden was reasonable given the important constitutional interests at stake. The court emphasized that if, during the stay, CBS's defense, which was based on truth, became prejudiced the district court was not precluded from imposing the sanction of dismissal at that time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   More recently, in\n   <em>\n    Armstrong v.

Although he initially was charged by the Municipality of Anchorage with dissemination\n   of indecent materials to a minor, those charges were dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Thereafter, Armstrong sued Tanaka for defamation. During his deposition, Armstrong invoked his Fifth Amendment privilege in response to numerous questions. Tanaka filed a motion to compel. Three\n   months later, the State of Alaska charged Armstrong with possession and distribution of child pornography. The following month, the court in the civil case granted Tanaka's motion to compel, ordering Armstrong to answer questions \"that appear to overlap with his criminal case\" at a continued deposition scheduled a month later.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6992686\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/228/79/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6992686\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/228/79/\">\n    at 81\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Armstrong moved for reconsideration and advised Tanaka's counsel that he would not appear for the continued deposition.

As the Third Circuit explained in\n   <em>\n    McMullen\n   </em>\n   , when a party is asserting a constitutional privilege, any detriment to that party from doing so must \" 'be no more than is necessary to prevent unfair and unnecessary prejudice to the other side.' \"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1533893\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/335/215/#p218\">\n    335 F.3d at 218\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    SEC v.

The court opined that Kristi likely had waived her Fifth Amendment privilege \"to a certain extent\" by her deposition testimony. In other words, it did not ascertain that she had a Fifth Amendment interest to balance. For the reasons already discussed, this was wrong, as Kristi did not waive her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. The court further reasoned that potential delays in the criminal case against Kristi, coupled with the Mosers' having engaged in extensive discovery and trial preparation, militated against a stay. In so ruling, the court gave no consideration to Kristi's interests under Article 19. The court was obligated, \"[a]t a minimum, ... [to] balance[e] [Kristi's] right to assert [her] Fifth Amendment privilege without penalty and [her]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   right of access to the courts against the [Mosers'] right to defend ... against [Kristi's] allegations and interest in timely resolution of the proceedings against [them].\"\n   <em>\n    Armstrong\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6992686\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/228/79/\">\n    228 P.3d at 85\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Nor did the court consider whether a stay would not merely inconvenience the Mosers but actually would prejudice them. By not applying the proper legal standard in ruling on the motion to stay, the court abused its discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   We shall not remand this matter to the circuit court to reconsider the motion to stay because a proper balancing of the competing interests in this case, when the stay was requested, necessarily would have weighed so heavily in favor of granting a stay that it would have been an abuse of discretion to rule otherwise. We explain.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   As noted, the Heffingtons had a right under Article 19 to access the courts to seek a remedy for the injuries they claimed they had suffered by virtue of the Mosers' alleged wrongs. They filed suit in March 2016 because their cause of action for defamation-clearly their primary claim-carried a one-year statute of limitations under CJP \u00a7 5-105 (\"An action for assault, libel, or slander shall be filed within one year from the date it accrues.\"). They could not delay filing suit beyond then without running a strong risk that their defamation claim would be barred by limitations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The June 19, 2017 trial date was established by the court via scheduling order on August 16, 2016, and was the first and only trial date. Neither side requested a postponement of the trial date until the Heffingtons filed their motion to stay, by which time discovery was completed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   The predicate events for the Heffingtons' civil suit completely overlapped the predicate events for several of the crimes for which Kristi was indicted in February 2017. If the criminal case had gone to trial on June 7, 2017, as originally scheduled, in all likelihood the trial would have been completed before the\n   civil suit went to trial, greatly mitigating Kristi's interest in avoiding self-incrimination. The State, not Kristi, sought the postponement of the criminal trial date that switched the order in which the cases would be tried, creating Kristi's Fifth Amendment dilemma. The Heffingtons filed their motion to stay eight days after that switch in trial dates, which is hardly dilatory.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Without a stay in the trial of the civil suit until after the criminal case was resolved,\n   Kristi would risk incriminating herself by testifying, and her testimony was crucial to her civil claims. Thus, she would be in the predicament of \"choosing between [her] silence and her lawsuit.\"\n   <em>\n    Wehling\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1426246\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/608/1084/\">\n    608 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1088 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Armstrong\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6992686\" index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/228/79/\">\n    228 P.3d at 85\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (dismissal of Armstrong's defamation action infringed upon his Fifth Amendment privilege and his \"general right of access to the courts\"). The burden Kristi would (and ultimately did) suffer by denial of a stay was severe and costly.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Wright, Charles A., Miller, Arthur R., et al., 8\n   <em>\n    Federal Practice &amp; Procedure\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2018 at 455 (3d ed. 2010) (\"[T]o grant an adverse judgment ... merely for claiming the constitutional privilege [against self-incrimination] certainly makes the resort to the privilege too 'costly.' \").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Of course, the Mosers had an interest in defending the claims against them and having them resolved expeditiously. Yet, the civil suit was not by any measure a case that had been languishing in the courts for an unduly prolonged period of time. The complaint was filed on March 21, 2016; the defendants filed a motion to dismiss on May 17, 2016; the motion was denied on August 1, 2016; an August 11, 2016 scheduling order set the trial for June 19-22, 2017; the defendants filed answers on August 22, 2016; and discovery ensued continuously thereafter. The case was specially assigned on May 11, 2017, after an unsuccessful ADR conference. There were no postponements of the trial date. By the time the motion to\n   stay was considered, the case only had been pending for a year and three months. Although there also is a strong public interest in cases proceeding expeditiously, we find wisdom in the Third Circuit's admonition in\n   <em>\n    McMullen\n   </em>\n   : \"The only virtue in dismissing the case here was clearing the court's docket. Although promptness in judicial administration is highly desirable, delay may sometimes be necessary to the mission of doing justice.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1533893\" index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/335/215/#p218\">\n    335 F.3d at 219\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Under the circumstances, the Heffingtons' interest in pursuing their civil suit to trial at a time when Kristi could testify without the risk of self-incrimination far outweighed any burden upon the Mosers from a delay in the trial date until the criminal case has been resolved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   As already mentioned, a plaintiff whose constitutional rights are jeopardized by further proceedings in her own case is entitled to a stay unless \"other, less burdensome, remedies would be an ineffective means of preventing unfairness to defendant.\"\n   <em>\n    Wehling\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1426246\" index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/608/1084/\">\n    608 F.2d at 1088\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, any prejudice to the Mosers from a stay of the trial of the civil suit would be slight when compared to the prejudice to the Heffingtons. The Mosers were not at risk of having \"crucial avenues of discovery\" cut off during the stay because discovery was complete.\n   <em>\n    Ex Parte Baugh\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7550993\" index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/530/238/\">\n    530 So.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   245 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wehling\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1426246\" index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/608/1084/\">\n    608 F.2d at 1089\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting the possibility that \"avenues of discovery\" might close during pendency of stay, justifying dismissal). We understand that the stay requested was open-ended in time, because the new August 23, 2017 criminal trial date could be postponed. (In fact, it later was postponed.) The stay as requested would have protected Kristi in exercising her implicated constitutional rights without any serious adverse consequences to the Mosers, however.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   For all of these reasons, we shall vacate the judgment in favor of the Mosers.
