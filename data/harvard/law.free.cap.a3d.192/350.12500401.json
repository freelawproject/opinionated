MINEHART\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Respondent Magisterial District Judge Michael G. Shaw (Respondent Shaw) has been accused of judicial misconduct by the Judicial Conduct Board in a Complaint filed on November 1, 2016, and by Ian Amended Complaint filed on July 14, 2017. Discovery was completed and then a pretrial conference was held on December 7, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Subsequently, the parties agreed to Joint Stipulations of Fact in Lieu of Trial and a Waiver of Trial Pursuant to C.J.D.R.P. No. 502(D)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Respondent Shaw's improper conduct spanned the recent adoption of the New Rules Governing Standards of Conduct of Magisterial District Judges. The facts concerning the charges against Respondent Shaw are set forth in the Joint Stipulations of Fact agreed to by the parties, and now, accepted by this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Joint Stipulations of Fact submitted by the parties which are accepted by this Court are set forth in their entirely as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   1. Article V, \u00a7 18 of the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania grants to the Board the authority to determine whether there is probable cause to file formal charges against a judicial officer in this Court, and thereafter, to prosecute the case in support of such charges in this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   2. From 1994 until the present time, Respondent Shaw has served as Judge of Magisterial District Court 42-3-02.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   3. Beginning in or about January or February 2006 until March 2011, and from June 2012 through June or July 2014, Respondent Shaw served as the Presiding Judge of Treatment Court at the Court of Common Pleas of Bradford County.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   4. In or about June or July 2014, President Judge Maureen T. Beirne removed Respondent Shaw from his position as Presiding Judge of Treatment Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   5. Based on Confidential Requests for Investigation at JCB File No. 2014-621 and 2016-643, the Board investigated the instant matters.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   6. As a result of its investigation, and pursuant to Article V, \u00a7 18(a)(7) of the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, the Board determined that there is probable cause to file formal charges against Respondent Shaw in this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   7. Some of the alleged judicial misconduct occurred prior to December 1, 2014 and therefore, the Old Rules Governing Standards of Conduct of Magisterial District Judges (R.G.S.C.M.D.J.) apply to this Court's determination of whether Respondent Shaw engaged in the alleged misconduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   8. Some of the alleged judicial misconduct occurred after November 30, 2014 and therefore, the New R.G.S.C.M.D.J. apply to this Court's determination of whether Respondent Shaw engaged in the alleged misconduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Impropriety: Sexting Conduct\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   9. For a total of approximately seven years, Respondent Shaw served as the Presiding Judge of Treatment Court for the Court of Common Pleas of Bradford County, Pennsylvania.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   10. As the Presiding Judge of Treatment Court, Respondent Shaw was a member of the Treatment Court Committee, which was comprised of five or six other members.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   11. During Respondent Shaw's service as Presiding Judge of Treatment Court, the other members of the Treatment Court Committee included an attorney representative from the Bradford County Office of the District Attorney, an attorney representative from the Bradford County Office of the Public Defender, the Assistant Chief Probation Officer and one or more Probation Officers from the Bradford County Probation Department, and a drug and alcohol counselor from Mental Health Associates of Towanda.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   12. Each of the participants in Treatment Court had been charged with a DUI or drug related offense in the Court of Common Pleas of Bradford County.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   13. When a defendant is charged with a DUI or drug-related offense, a defendant may submit an application to participate in Treatment Court to the Bradford/Sullivan Drug and Alcohol Single County Authority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   14. The Bradford/Sullivan Drug and Alcohol Single County Authority performs an assessment and submits the results to the Treatment Court Committee for tentative approval.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   15. If the Treatment Court Committee approves the application and the defendant agrees to the conditions, then the defendant\n   appears in Criminal Court at the Court of Common Pleas for purposes of entering a guilty plea, to be sentenced on the underlying charges and to request placement in the Treatment Court Program.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   16. The Sentencing Order for each of the defendants admitted to Treatment Court includes a directive that the defendant must participate in Treatment Court in lieu of or in addition to a term of incarceration or other sentence and comply with all the agreed upon conditions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   17. The Treatment Court Committee reviews the participants' compliance with the rules and conditions of Treatment Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   18. If a Treatment Court participant fails to abide by the rules and conditions of Treatment Court, then the participant is subject to sanctions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   19. If the appropriate sanction for a Treatment Court participant is a prison term, then the case must be transferred to the Court of Common Pleas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   20. If the appropriate sanction for a Treatment Court participant is a lesser sanction, the Treatment Court Committee meets and decides upon the appropriate sanction. Then the Presiding Judge of Treatment Court is responsible for imposing the sanction during a Treatment Court proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   21. While serving as the Presiding Judge of Treatment Court, Respondent Shaw was the authority figure at Treatment Court who imposed sanctions less than imprisonment, after conferring and reaching consensus with the Treatment Court Committee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   22. As the Presiding Judge of Treatment Court, Respondent Shaw often told the participants, \"Honesty is part of the basis for treatment court.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   23. On May 30, 2013, J.L. was convicted of a repeat DUI offense in Bradford County.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   24. Senior Judge John Leete of Potter County sentenced J.L. to 24 months of intermediate punishment, which consisted of 84 days of incarceration in Bradford County Prison, followed by the remainder of his sentence to be served in Treatment Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   25. Following completion of his prison term, J.L. became a participant in the Bradford County Treatment Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   26. As Presiding Judge of Treatment Court, Respondent Shaw and the other members of the Bradford County Treatment Court Committee supervised J.L.'s conduct during the remainder of his sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   27. Respondent Shaw has known J.L. for many years. As a young man, Respondent Shaw worked for J.L.'s father and became acquainted with his family.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Sexting Conduct: Girlfriend of Treatment Court Participant\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   28. In February 2014, Respondent Shaw knew that D.A. was the girlfriend of J.L. J.L. had introduced D.A. to Respondent Shaw at a funeral in January 2013 and D.A. attended Treatment Court as a support person for J.L.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   29. In February 2014, D.A. contacted Respondent Shaw through his Facebook page and informed him that she planned to break up with J.L.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   30. D.A. believed that J.L. would be upset when she ended their relationship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   31. D.A. expressed concern about J.L.'s potential reaction to her ending their relationship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   32. In response to her Facebook message, Respondent Shaw placed a telephone call to D.A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   33. During their telephone conversation, D.A. voiced her concerns about J.L.'s counseling, court supervision and the possibility that he would relapse because of his history of alcohol dependency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   34. Subsequently, Respondent Shaw sent a text message to D.A. and asked for an update about her plans to end her relationship with J.L.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   35. Respondent Shaw continued to send frequent text messages to D.A. from February 2014 through April 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   36. Respondent Shaw admits that some of the text messages were very flirtatious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   37. Some of the text messages that Respondent Shaw sent to D.A. were sexual in nature (sexting).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   38. The Merriam Webster Dictionary defines \"sexting\" as \"the sending of sexually explicit messages or images by cell phone.\"\n   <em>\n    www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   39. The Urban Dictionary defines \"sexting\" as \"the act of text messaging someone in the hopes of having a sexual encounter with them later; initially casual, transitioning into highly suggestive and even sexually explicit.\"\n   <em>\n    www.urbandictionary.com\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   40.

Over the course of approximately one month, Respondent Shaw exchanged text and sext messages with D.A. on a frequent basis, at least once a day, sent and received day and night.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   44. In the course of the exchange of sext messages, D.A. sent a sexually suggestive photograph of her buttocks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   45. After approximately one month of texting and sexting communications, Respondent Shaw and D.A. agreed to meet in person.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   46. In March 2014, on a weekday and during the day, Respondent Shaw and D.A. met at a hotel in Binghamton, NY.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   47. D.A. entered the hotel lobby, registered for the room and conducted a cash transaction on behalf of herself and Respondent Shaw.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   48. While at the hotel, Respondent Shaw and D.A. engaged in sexual relations and stayed at the hotel for approximately two hours.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   49. Following his tryst with D.A., Respondent Shaw's relationship with her gradually faded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   50. By April 2014, Respondent Shaw stopped sending text messages to D.A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   51.

In February 2014, J.L. reviewed his cell phone bill and noticed text messages and phone calls between D.A. and a phone number with a 607 area code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   54. The calls and texts that J.L. observed on the cell phone bill took place after 10:00 - 11:00 p.m.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   55. J.L. called the 607 number and Respondent Shaw's name and phone number appeared in his cell phone directory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   56. J.L. questioned D.A. about why she was calling and texting Respondent Shaw after business hours.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   57. D.A. told J.L. that she had contacted Respondent Shaw by cell phone calls and text messages out of concern for J.L.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   58. Respondent Shaw drove Treatment Court participant's home from Treatment Court on a regular basis, including J.L.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   59.

Within his May 27, 2014 Facebook page response, Respondent Shaw agreed not to contact D.A. and apologized to her for his \"inappropriate\" and \"disrespectful\" conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   72. Within his May 27, 2014 Facebook page response, Respondent Shaw informed D.A. that he would \"defriend\" her from his Facebook page \"so there is no communication possibility.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   73.

The following Sunday, Respondent Shaw either texted or called J.L. to ask if they could meet.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   85. Respondent Shaw drove his vehicle to J.L.'s home and asked him to go for a ride.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   86. J.L. complied and rode with Respondent Shaw in his vehicle for about 10 minutes while they talked about Respondent Shaw's relationship with D.A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   87. During their conversation in the vehicle, Respondent Shaw spoke about resigning from his position as Presiding Judge of Treatment Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   88. J.L. recalled that during their conversation, Respondent Shaw advised J.L. that if he resigned, then Treatment Court would likely cease to exist.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   89. J.L. did not want to see Treatment Court fail because of his personal issues with Respondent Shaw.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   90. As a Level II Treatment Court participant, J.L. was required to attend Treatment Court every two weeks. Therefore, he was not required to and did not attend Treatment Court the week after Respondent Shaw apologized to and D.A. about his improper conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   91. Respondent Shaw chose to continue as Presiding Judge of Treatment Court, even after the Treatment Court session when he made the statement about \"eat[ing] humble pie.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   92. Respondent Shaw wanted to preside over a graduation ceremony for some of the Treatment Court participants, which was scheduled two weeks after the Treatment Court session when he made the statement about \"eat[ing] humble pie.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   93. J.L. was concerned about how Respondent Shaw's relationship with D.A. might impact his standing in Treatment Court and his supervision by the Treatment Court Committee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   94. After J.L. discovered the text and sext messages on D.A.'s cell phone, he discussed the situation with his drug and alcohol counselor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   95. Another Treatment Court participant, T.J., knew of Respondent Shaw's text and sext messages to D.A. and reported the information to Probation Officer Craig Duddy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   96. Probation Officer Duddy reported what he had learned from T.J. to Assistant Chief Probation Officer Ide.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   97. In or about June or July 2014, Assistant Chief Probation Officer Ide reported the information about Respondent Shaw's alleged conduct to President Judge Maureen T. Beirne.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   98. President Judge Beirne, Probation Officer Duddy, and Assistant Chief Probation Officer Ide met with Respondent Shaw for approximately 20 minutes and confronted him about the \"inappropriate texting\" with D.A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   99. During the meeting in President Judge Beirne's chambers, Respondent Shaw admitted that he sent and received sexually explicit texts to and from D.A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   100. During the meeting in President Judge Beirne's chambers, Respondent Shaw denied that he was having an affair with D.A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   101. As a result of Respondent Shaw's improper conduct toward D.A., President Judge Beirne informed Respondent Shaw she was removing him immediately from his position as Presiding Judge of Treatment Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   102. The timing of his removal as Presiding Judge of Treatment Court preceded the graduation ceremony that Respondent Shaw had hoped to attend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   103. Treatment Court participants learned of the sexting conduct and were upset that Respondent Shaw, who had repeatedly preached to them about honesty, had \"hurt one of their own behind their backs.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   104. Treatment Court participants regarded Respondent Shaw as \"their judge. He motivated them, acted like he cared and when this matter occurred they thought it was disturbing. Some lost their enthusiasm.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   105. J.L. was not aware that Respondent Shaw engaged in sexual relations with D.A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   106. Prior to the Board's investigation of the instant matter, President Judge Beirne was not aware that Respondent Shaw engaged in sexual relations with D.A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Sexting Conduct: Probation Officer\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   107.

In response to the Second Supplemental Notice of Full Investigation, Respondent Shaw identified R.K as one of the women to whom he sent sext messages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   109. R.K. is a 35-year-old woman who worked as Bradford County Adult Probation Department in 2012-2013.

In or about 2012-2013, R.K. served on the Treatment Court Committee for the Court of Common Pleas of Bradford County while Respondent Shaw was the Presiding Judge of Treatment Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   114. In or about 2012, while Respondent Shaw and R.K. served as members of the Treatment Court Committee, Respondent Shaw began to use his personal cell phone to send text and sext messages to R.K.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   115. R.K. described the text and sext messages that she received from Respondent Shaw as flirtatious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   116. R.K. was \"shocked by the text messages from Respondent Shaw but went along with them.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   117. R.K. did not tell Respondent Shaw to stop sending the text and sext messages to her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   118. Respondent Shaw and R.K. exchanged sext messages from 2012 through 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   119. In 2013, R.K. changed jobs to work for Bradford County Court Administration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   120. When R.K. ceased working for Adult Probation and serving on the Treatment Court Committee, R.K and Respondent Shaw no longer communicated with one another on a frequent basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   121. In or about 2013, Respondent Shaw gradually stopped exchanging text and sext messages with R.K.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   122.

DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-313\">\n   The most serious charge against Respondent Shaw is that he engaged in behavior which brought the judicial office into disrepute (Count Seven, Article V, \u00a7 18(d)(1) of the Constitution of Pennsylvania.) We find that Respondent Shaw did violate the Disrepute Clause by his actions described in the Joint Stipulations, particularly his actions in sending salacious text messages and engaging in sexual relations with the girlfriend of a defendant who was appearing before him in Treatment Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-314\">\n   Whether a judge's improper conduct brings the\n   <em>\n    judicial\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    office\n   </em>\n   (as opposed to the individual judge) into disrepute has been addressed by this Court repeatedly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-315\">\n   As noted in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     In re Cicchetti,\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12012588\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/697/297/\">\n    697 A.2d 297\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Pa.Ct.Jud.Disc. 1997) :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-316\">\n   The determination of whether particular conduct has brought the judicial office into disrepute, of necessity, is a determination which must be made on a case by case basis as the particular conduct in each case is scrutinized and weighed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-317\">\n   Many types of misconduct have been found to violate the Disrepute Clause. We have repeatedly found that\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   contacts with a judge which could improperly favor one party in a case can amount to bringing disrepute upon the judiciary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     In re Sullivan,\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6811939\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/135/1164/\">\n    135 A.3d 1164\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Pa.Ct.Jud.Disc. 2016) ;\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     In re Roca,\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12145598\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/151/739/\">\n    151 A.3d 739\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Pa.Ct.Jud.Disc. 2016) ;\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     In re Segal,\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12145518\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/151/734/\">\n    151 A.3d 734\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Pa.Ct.Jud.Disc. 2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-318\">\n   Similarly, a judge's failure to file taxes (while judging others for tax violations) was found to have brought disrepute upon the judiciary,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     In re Ballentine,\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6847947\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/121/611/\">\n    121 A.3d 611\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Pa.Ct.Jud.Disc. 2015) as was the sexual touching of a minor\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     In re Liberace,\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6860720\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/118/497/\">\n    118 A.3d 497\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Pa.Ct.Jud.Disc. 2014).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-319\">\n   In\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     In re Nocella,\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7303307\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/79/766/\">\n    79 A.3d 766\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Pa.Ct.Jud.Disc. 2013) a violation of the Disrepute Clause was found for the actions of a judicial candidate for repeatedly lying about his qualifications for that office. A judge who photographed his genitals and displayed that photograph to an uninterested person was found to violate the Disrepute Clause in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     In re Singletary,\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7309905\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/61/402/\">\n    61 A.3d 402\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Pa.Ct.Jud.Disc. 2012), as was a judge's conduct in offering two female housing court litigants favorable treatment in their eviction cases in exchange for sexual favors\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     In re Cioppa\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7312730\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/51/923/\">\n    51 A.3d 923\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Pa.Ct.Jud.Disc. 2012).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-320\">\n   Here, misconduct which includes a judge engaging in secret sexual relations with the girlfriend of a defendant appearing before him whose fate is, to some degree, in that judge's hands is sufficiently shocking as to amount to a violation of the Disrepute Clause. The salacious text messages sent by Respondent Shaw also violate our ethical rules. We also find a violation in Respondent Shaw's actions and inactions regarding Mr. DiPaola, his attorney in this matter at that time, in representing parties in civil litigation before him while also representing Shaw in this disciplinary case with no notice to the opposing party.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-321\">\n   At a minimum the opposing counsel or party in those civil cases should have been informed of that disciplinary representation. Failing to so inform is clearly wrong. Recusal would have been the most sensible course.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-322\">\n   An assortment of other more minor charges are also included in the Amended Complaint in this case. The Complaint recites alleged misconduct involving not following the local practices of treatment court concerning communication with participants, informal texts with participants and their relatives relating to a truancy case as well as similar informality in juvenile accountability court and in the aftermath of a traffic case. It is also argued that Respondent Shaw showed favoritism to treatment court participants who had lost their licenses by giving them rides home from meetings. Because of our disposition of the more serious charges as set forth above we are not addressing the less serious charges described in this paragraph.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-323\">\n   Unlike a criminal case in which the range of penalties is determined by the number of charges and the statutory sentence mandated for each offense upon which there is a finding of guilt, the scope of sanctions available to this Court, is not so circumscribed. Any finding by this Court that a judicial officer has violated the Constitution of Pennsylvania or the Code of Judicial Conduct subjects that\n   judge to the full range of appropriate discipline. Furthermore, in exercising our discretion in imposing a disciplinary sanction, we are guided not by the number of ways the Respondent's conduct has offended the Constitution or Code but by the nature of the conduct itself and any mitigating or aggravating circumstances.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     In re Murphy\n    </strong>\n    ,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7289907\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/10/932/#p937\">\n    10 A.3d 932\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 937 (Pa.Ct.Jud.Disc. 2010).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-324\">\n   In considering the conduct we find violative as set forth above we hold that such conduct violates at least parts of all seven Counts of the Amended Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-325\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSIONS OF LAW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-326\">\n   1.
