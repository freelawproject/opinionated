By order dated March 28, 2017, common pleas denied Licensee's appeal from a one-year suspension of his operating privilege imposed by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Department of Transportation, Bureau of Driver Licensing (DOT), under Section 1547(b)(1)(i) of the Vehicle Code, 75 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 1547(b)(1)(i), commonly referred to as the Implied Consent Law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Subsequently, common pleas granted Licensee's Motion for Reconsideration of the March 28, 2017 Order to the extent of holding a hearing thereon, and then effectively confirmed its March 28, 2017 Order in its June 27, 2017 Order.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   On appeal, Licensee argues that he did not knowingly and consciously refuse a chemical test of his blood and was, therefore, deprived of procedural due process of law. He claims this is because the Pennsylvania State Police Trooper who stopped him provided him with \"partially incorrect\" information, telling him that he would be subject to enhanced criminal penalties if he refused the blood test and was convicted of driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI). (Licensee's Brief (Br.) at 8.) It was shortly after Licensee's\n   arrest that the United States Supreme Court decided\n   <em>\n    Birchfield v. North Dakota\n   </em>\n   , 579 U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597986\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2160/\">\n    136 S.Ct. 2160\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597986\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2160/\">\n    195 L.Ed.2d 560\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016), which held that a state may not impose criminal penalties on a motorist for refusing to submit to a chemical test of his blood requested pursuant to an implied consent law. Licensee argues that, had he been correctly informed that only his operating privilege would be suspended if he refused a chemical test of his blood, consistent with\n   <em>\n    Birchfield\n   </em>\n   , then he would have submitted to the test. We conclude that Licensee knowingly and consciously refused chemical testing, and he was not deprived of procedural due process. The Pennsylvania State Police Trooper provided Licensee with a warning that was accurate at the time it was given. While the portion of the warning about enhanced criminal penalties was retroactively rendered inaccurate following\n   <em>\n    Birchfield\n   </em>\n   , Licensee's refusal at the time was still knowing and conscious and he was not deprived of procedural due process by the suspension of his operating privilege. This is because Licensee knew, as the Pennsylvania State Police Trooper had conveyed it to him, that if he refused chemical testing he would be in violation of the law and he would be penalized for that violation with the suspension of his operating privilege. Therefore, common pleas properly reinstated the suspension of Licensee's operating privilege.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   DOT informed Licensee that his operating privilege was suspended for one year as a result of his failure to submit to chemical testing in violation of Section 1547(b)(1)(i) of the Vehicle Code. On May 19, 2016, Licensee appealed to common pleas pursuant to Section 1550(a) of the Vehicle Code, 75 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 1550(a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   At the hearing, testimony was presented that on April 13, 2016, at 8:44 p.m., Pennsylvania State Police Trooper Erjon Mollaj (Trooper) was traveling southbound along Route 476 in Radnor Township, Delaware County, when he observed Licensee's vehicle traveling at a high rate of speed. During the ensuing traffic stop, while Trooper questioned Licensee, Trooper detected an odor of alcohol emanating from Licensee's breath and the inside of Licensee's vehicle. Trooper testified that Licensee admitted to him that \"he had a few drinks.\" (Reproduced Record (R.R.) at 35a.) Licensee agreed, at Trooper's request, to submit to a series of field sobriety tests, which he did not successfully complete. Trooper placed Licensee under arrest for DUI and transported him to a hospital for chemical testing of his blood. At the hospital, Trooper read verbatim to Licensee DOT Form DL-26, which stated, in relevant part, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   1. You are under arrest for driving under the influence of alcohol or a controlled substance in violation of Section 3802 of the Vehicle Code.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   2. I am requesting that you submit to a chemical test of blood.\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   3. If you refuse to submit to the chemical test,\n   <strong>\n    your operating privilege will be suspended\n   </strong>\n   for at least 12 months .... In addition, if you refuse to submit to the chemical test,\n   <strong>\n    and you are convicted\n   </strong>\n   of violating Section 3802(a)(1) (relating to impaired driving) of the Vehicle Code,\n   then, because of your refusal, you will be subject to\n   <strong>\n    more severe penalties\n   </strong>\n   set forth in Section 3804(c) (relating to penalties) of the Vehicle Code. These are the same penalties that would be imposed if you were convicted of driving with the highest rate of alcohol, which include a minimum of 72 consecutive hours in jail and a minimum fine of $1,000.00,\n   <strong>\n    up to a maximum of five years in jail and a maximum fine of $10,000\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   * * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 90a (emphasis added).) Trooper explained the warnings to Licensee twice. Licensee\n   <strong>\n    signed the form\n   </strong>\n   , acknowledging that he understood the warnings, but stated, \"\n   <strong>\n    I'm not taking the test\n   </strong>\n   .\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 39a (emphasis added).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Licensee testified that when Trooper warned him that if he refused chemical testing he could be imprisoned for five years and fined $10,000, Licensee \"froze, completely.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 67a.) Licensee further testified that he had \"never had anything criminal in [his] life before this\" and he \"was shell-shocked.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Licensee testified that if he had known that there were only civil penalties for refusing chemical testing, and not also criminal penalties if he was subsequently convicted, Licensee would have submitted to the blood test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   At the conclusion of the evidence and in a brief, Licensee argued that following his arrest, the United States Supreme Court issued\n   <em>\n    Birchfield\n   </em>\n   , which precludes a state from imposing a criminal penalty for refusing to submit to a blood test required under an implied consent law. Thus, Licensee continued, when Trooper warned Licensee that he would be subject to criminal penalties if he refused a blood test, Licensee was provided with incorrect information. (R.R. at 76a; Record (R.) Item 7, Amended Memorandum of Law at 2.) Licensee noted that just days after the\n   <em>\n    Birchfield\n   </em>\n   decision, DOT amended Form DL-26 and created DOT Form DL-26B, which removed any mention of enhanced criminal penalties for refusing a blood test.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Since Licensee was informed that he was facing a criminal penalty, he believed that he should neither speak nor consent to a blood test. Licensee contended that his confusion was directly attributable to the incorrect information Trooper provided him. Had Licensee been correctly informed that if he refused the blood test, he was facing only a civil penalty of the loss of his operating privilege, Licensee, as he testified, would have submitted to the blood test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Common pleas denied Licensee's appeal and reinstated DOT's suspension of Licensee's operating privilege. In its decision, common pleas rejected Licensee's reliance on\n   <em>\n    Birchfield\n   </em>\n   , concluding that it \"does not apply to civil license suspension proceedings.\" (Common Pleas Opinion (Op.) \u00b6 25.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Licensee then filed a Motion for Reconsideration, arguing that common pleas \"did not address the central question\" Licensee raised, \"which was that [Licensee] was denied due process because [Trooper] provided [Licensee] with incorrect information[.]\" (R. Item 7, Motion for Reconsideration at 1-2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Common pleas granted the Motion for Reconsideration to the extent of holding a hearing thereon, but then denied the Motion for Reconsideration, which, in this instance, operated as confirmation of common pleas' prior Order denying Licensee's appeal. Following Licensee's filing of a Concise Statement of Errors Complained of on Appeal, common pleas issued its opinion pursuant to Pennsylvania Rule of Appellate Procedure 1925(a),\n   Pa.R.A.P. 1925(a). Common pleas noted that in\n   <em>\n    Birchfield\n   </em>\n   , the Court \"did not question the constitutionality of the implied consent laws that impose only civil penalties.\" (Common Pleas 1925(a) Op. (1925(a) Op.) at 9, Aug. 16, 2017.) Further, citing\n   <em>\n    Boseman v. Department of Transportation, Bureau of Driver Licensing\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12316290\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/157/10/#p20\">\n    157 A.3d 10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 20 (Pa. Cmwlth.),\n   <em>\n    petition for allowance of appeal denied\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12328057,12328042,12328029\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/170/996/\">\n    170 A.3d 996\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Pa. 2017), common pleas noted that this Court \"emphasized that a license suspension stemming from a refusal to submit to chemical testing [of blood] is a separate administrative proceeding from a criminal DUI proceeding arising out of the same incident.\" (1925(a) Op. at 9.) Common pleas concluded that\n   <em>\n    Birchfield\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Boseman\n   </em>\n   controlled. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12.) Based on\n   <em>\n    Birchfield\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Boseman\n   </em>\n   , common pleas held that Licensee was not denied due process. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13.) Licensee was not denied due process because: Licensee was advised of the civil penalty of the suspension of his operating privilege for refusing a blood test; Licensee knowingly and voluntarily decided not to submit to a blood test; and the civil penalty occurs in the context of a \"\n   <strong>\n    separate\n   </strong>\n   administrative proceeding from a criminal DUI proceeding arising out of the same incident.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12-13 (emphasis in original) (citing\n   <em>\n    Boseman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12316290\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/157/10/#p20\">\n    157 A.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   20 ).) Accordingly, \"the reading of the enhanced criminal penalties did not deny [Licensee] procedural due process in the separate civil administrative proceeding.\" (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12316290\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/157/10/#p20\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12316290\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/157/10/#p20\">\n    at 13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Licensee argues, based on\n   <em>\n    Birchfield\n   </em>\n   , that Trooper misinformed Licensee that he would be subject to criminal penalties if he refused a chemical test of his blood and was convicted of DUI. This misinformation alone, Licensee argues, is enough to overturn the suspension of his operating privilege, regardless of whether he relied on it. (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12316290\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/157/10/#p20\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 18-19 (citing\n   <em>\n    Peppelman v. Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   , 44 Pa.Cmwlth. 262,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=403%20A.2d%201041\">\n    403 A.2d 1041\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1979) ).) But, in this case, Licensee argues that he did rely on this misinformation in deciding not to submit to a chemical test of his blood. Licensee notes he testified that, had he known he was facing only a civil penalty of the suspension of his operating privilege if he refused to submit, he would have submitted to a chemical test of his blood. Licensee, in addition to distinguishing\n   <em>\n    Boseman\n   </em>\n   on the facts, argues that it does not matter\n   that this is a civil proceeding. Due process of law, according to Licensee, still requires that when faced with having to quickly decide whether to submit to chemical testing of his blood, he be provided with correct information regarding the consequences of refusing such a test before his operating privilege could be suspended.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   DOT responds that common pleas correctly reinstated the suspension of Licensee's operating privilege. DOT asserts that, at the time Trooper warned Licensee about the consequences of refusing a chemical test of his blood, which was prior to\n   <em>\n    Birchfield\n   </em>\n   , those warnings were correct as a matter of law. DOT agrees with Licensee that\n   <em>\n    Birchfield\n   </em>\n   applies to cases such as Licensee's that were pending when\n   <em>\n    Birchfield\n   </em>\n   was decided, but DOT contends that\n   <em>\n    Birchfield\n   </em>\n   does not warrant a different result. This is because, as this Court stated in\n   <em>\n    Boseman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Birchfield\n   </em>\n   impacts criminal DUI proceedings, not civil license suspension proceedings. In other words, DOT argues, the two proceedings are separate. DOT asserts that where the results of a blood test are involuntarily obtained, the remedy is the suppression of those results in a criminal DUI proceeding. However, here, Licensee did not submit to a blood test and, thus, there was nothing to suppress. Since Licensee was properly warned of the civil consequences of refusing a blood test, and Licensee knowingly and consciously refused the test, his operating privilege was properly suspended, DOT asserts. Therefore, DOT argues, \"it makes no difference\" that Licensee was warned about both civil and criminal penalties for refusing a blood test because he was properly warned that his operating privilege would be suspended if he refused the blood test, and the warnings about criminal penalties, as held in\n   <em>\n    Boseman\n   </em>\n   , have no impact on the suspension of Licensee's operating privilege. (DOT's Br. at 27.) Accordingly, DOT concludes, Licensee knowingly and consciously refused a chemical test of his blood, and he was not deprived of due process of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Following the parties' submission of their briefs, we directed the parties to address the following questions at oral argument:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   Where a licensee suspected of driving under the influence is not given an accurate version of the warning, as required by\n   <em>\n    Department of Transportation, Bureau of Traffic Safety v.

Prior to\n   <em>\n    Birchfield,\n   </em>\n   under former Section 1547(b)(2) of the Vehicle Code, a police officer was obligated to warn a licensee stopped on suspicion of DUI that the failure to submit to chemical testing, of either breath or blood, would result in the suspension of the licensee's operating privilege\n   <strong>\n    and\n   </strong>\n   subject the licensee to the imposition of enhanced criminal penalties if the licensee was convicted of the DUI.\n   <em>\n    Former\n   </em>\n   75 Pa.

In\n   <em>\n    Birchfield\n   </em>\n   , the challenge was to two similar laws, one from Minnesota and the other from North Dakota, that made it a crime for a motorist suspected of DUI to refuse a breath or blood test required under those states' implied consent laws. 579 U.S. at ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597986\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2160/\">\n    136 S.Ct. at 2170-72\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Supreme Court held, in relevant part, as follows: the search-incident-to-arrest exception to the warrant requirement justifies a warrantless search of a motorist's breath, but not his blood; implied consent under an implied consent law does not justify the warrantless search of a motorist's blood; and a state may not impose criminal penalties on a motorist for refusing a blood test requested under an implied consent law. On that latter point, the Supreme Court concluded that it is unreasonable to impose criminal penalties on a motorist who refuses \"an intrusive blood test\" required under an implied consent law, stating \"[t]here must be a limit to the consequences to which motorists may be deemed to have consented by virtue of a decision to drive on public roads.\" 579 U.S. at ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597986\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2160/\">\n    136 S.Ct. at 2185-86\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This point, however, was prefaced by the Court's statement that \"[o]ur prior opinions have referred\n   <strong>\n    approvingly\n   </strong>\n   to the general concept of implied-consent laws that\n   <strong>\n    impose civil penalties\n   </strong>\n   and evidentiary consequences on motorists who refuse to comply ....

Second, even if the warning was subsequently rendered inaccurate by the change in the law brought about by\n   <em>\n    Birchfield\n   </em>\n   , Licensee's refusal was still knowing and conscious because he was warned that his operating privilege would be suspended if he refused chemical testing.

The licensee claimed this refusal was not knowing \"because he was misled into believing that he was entitled to confer with an attorney prior to deciding to take the test.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 876. Our Supreme Court held that the licensee was entitled to be told that\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights \"are inapplicable\" to a chemical test and that he \"does not have the right to consult with an attorney or anyone else prior to taking the test.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 878. The Supreme Court reasoned that the licensee was entitled to this information so that he could make a \"knowing and conscious\" decision.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Further, the Supreme Court stated, it was appropriate to place the duty on the officer to clarify \"the extent of the right to counsel\" when requesting that the licensee take a chemical test because it was the police's \"course of conduct\" that \"creat[ed] the confusion in these cases.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.O'Connell\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable from the instant matter because in\n   <em>\n    O'Connell\n   </em>\n   the warnings were inherently contradictory.

Thus, the warnings were contradictory and, as\n   <em>\n    O'Connell\n   </em>\n   held, had to be clarified by the officer advising the licensee that there is no right to consult with an attorney prior to taking the chemical test.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dep't of Transp., Bureau of Driver Licensing v.

While Trooper also warned Licensee that he would be subject to enhanced criminal penalties if he refused and was subsequently convicted of DUI, this warning, rendered retroactively inaccurate by the change in the law brought about by\n   <em>\n    Birchfield\n   </em>\n   , did not make Licensee's refusal not knowing and conscious nor deprive Licensee of procedural due process. Licensee knew that he would be in violation of the law if he refused chemical testing and that he would be penalized for that violation by the suspension of his operating privilege, because Trooper conveyed this information to him. Yet, Licensee still refused chemical testing. While Licensee claims that the warning about enhanced criminal penalties left him \"froze[n]\" and \"shell-shocked,\" other facts in the record belie these claims. (R.R. at 67a.) Moreover, Licensee's claim that the warning was coercive and that\n   <em>\n    Birchfield\n   </em>\n   should be extended to civil license suspension proceedings is one which we have rejected several times already. Therefore, we must affirm common pleas' Order refusing to rescind DOT's one-year suspension of Licensee's operating privilege.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ORDER\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    NOW\n   </strong>\n   , August 9, 2018, the Order of the Court of Common Pleas of Delaware County, dated June 27, 2017, is\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    Section 1547(b)(1)(i) reads, in pertinent part, as follows:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n    (1) If any person placed under arrest for a violation of section 3802 [relating to driving under the influence of alcohol or controlled substance] is requested to submit to chemical testing and refuses to do so, the testing shall not be conducted but upon notice by the police officer, the department shall suspend the operating privilege of the person as follows:\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n    (i) Except as set forth in subparagraph (ii), for a period of 12 months.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    75 Pa.
