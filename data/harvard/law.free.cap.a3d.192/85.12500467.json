We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The facts of this case read like a law school exam. A man is captured on surveillance video extending his arm in a position consistent with firing a gun. At the same time as indicated on the video, a vehicle carrying three persons arrives at an intersection near the gunman's location, and turns down a road. That vehicle is followed by two more cars. The driver of the first car, Danielle Kelsey, is struck in the back with a single bullet, causing significant injuries. No one else is hit. There is no forensic or ballistics evidence to establish the path of the bullet that struck the victim, nor are any other bullets recovered. However, police discover ten fired cartridge casings from the location of the gunman as indicated by the video, all of which were fired from the same weapon. The gunman is identified, arrested, and speaks to police. He asks what his bail would be if the shooting was an accident. What crimes have been committed?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    Appellant's charges\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Commonwealth charged Appellant with,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , two counts of attempted\n   murder, and two counts of aggravated assault.

Furthermore, the aggravated assault statutory language includes attempt within its definition, and we therefore apply the language contained within \u00a7 901 when analyzing the sufficiency of attempted aggravated assault.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth v.

Appellant filed a timely notice of appeal, and the trial court ordered him to file a Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b) concise statement of matters complained of on appeal. The trial court authored its opinion in response, and the matter is ready for review of Appellant's two claims:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   A.

For purposes of sufficiency of the evidence review, it is undisputed that the Commonwealth established that Appellant was the gunman.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The following principles govern our review.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   Because a determination of evidentiary sufficiency presents a question of law, our standard of review is\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   and our scope of review is plenary. In reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence, we must determine whether the evidence admitted at trial and all reasonable inferences drawn therefrom, viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth as verdict winner, were sufficient to prove every element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. [T]he facts and circumstances established by the Commonwealth need not preclude every possibility of innocence. It is within the province of the fact-finder to determine the weight to be accorded to each witness's testimony and to believe all, part, or none of the evidence. The Commonwealth may sustain its burden of proving every element of the crime by means of wholly circumstantial evidence. Moreover, as an appellate court, we may not re-weigh the evidence and substitute our judgment for that of the fact-finder.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth v. Williams\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12350412\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/176/298/#p305\">\n    176 A.3d 298\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 305-06 (Pa.Super. 2017) (citations and quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    A\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    Specific intent, transferred intent, and inchoate crimes\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The crimes at issue all required proof of specific intent. There is no dispute that firing ten bullets at a person constitutes a substantial step towards the commission of attempted homicide if directed at a particular person. The debate between the parties focuses on what Appellant was intending to do when he fired those bullets. The key point of contention revolves around\n   the fact that the Commonwealth conceded that Appellant did not target Ms. Kelsey's vehicle, based upon his statement to police:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   [Appellant's] purposeful conduct of extending his arm in a shooting position and firing ten shots from a semi-automatic weapon into a populated street proved his intent to cause serious bodily injury to the unidentified person designated \"John Doe.\" That is why he asked Detective Rocks what the consequences would be if shooting Ms. Kelsey was an accident.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Commonwealth's brief at 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The fact that the Commonwealth explicitly alleged that Appellant did not intend to hit Ms. Kelsey or her vehicle means that he did not, in the Commonwealth's view, specifically intend to kill her. Rather, Appellant had intended to kill someone else, but the Commonwealth could not identify him. The decision to charge specific intent crimes naming Ms. Kelsey as a victim despite the presence of only one purported victim is permissible under Pennsylvania law. The dissonance is resolved by the doctrine of transferred intent.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth v. Thompson\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"837153\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/559/229/\">\n    559 Pa. 229\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"837153,11568179,11568126,837127\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/739/1023/\">\n    739 A.2d 1023\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1999), our Supreme Court held that transferred intent applies to inchoate crimes. Therein, Donovan Aitken exited his apartment along with his girlfriend and another man, Francisco Forbes. As Forbes crossed the street towards his vehicle, he observed Thompson pull out a gun and shoot in his direction. Forbes, thinking that Thompson was firing at him, ran in a zig-zag pattern to avoid being shot. As it turned out, Thompson was targeting Aitken, who fell to the ground during the melee. Forbes then saw Thompson shoot Aitken several more times, killing him. Thompson was convicted of,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , first-degree homicide for killing Aitken, and attempted aggravated assault with respect to Forbes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The theory supporting the attempted aggravated assault conviction was that Thompson's specific intent to murder Aitken transferred to Forbes, even though Forbes did not suffer serious bodily injury. Thompson asserted that the evidence was legally insufficient, and claimed that the trial court erroneously issued a transferred intent instruction over his objection since he did not intend to cause any injury to Forbes. Our Supreme Court disagreed:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   Appellant claims that the transferred intent instruction was not warranted because Forbes was never actually shot and because Forbes was not an intended victim. As noted above, however, in order to sustain the conviction for aggravated assault, the Commonwealth only needed to establish that appellant attempted to cause serious bodily injury. There is no requirement that the victim actually be injured. Moreover, appellant's argument that the transferred intent\n   instruction was not warranted because he did not intend to shoot Forbes ignores the essence of the transferred intent doctrine, that is, the person who ultimately is the victim\n   <em>\n    not be\n   </em>\n   the original intended victim. The transferred intent theory provides that if the intent to commit a crime exists, this intent can be transferred for the purpose of finding the intent element of another crime. The evidence here demonstrated that appellant shot in the direction of Forbes even though he may have only intended to shoot Aitken. This evidence was sufficient to warrant the transferred intent instruction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"837153,11568179,11568126,837127\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/739/1023/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"837153,11568179,11568126,837127\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/739/1023/\">\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </strong>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"837153,11568179,11568126,837127\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/739/1023/\">\n    at 1029-30\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (footnote, quotation marks, and citations omitted) (emphasis in original). Since\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Thompson\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   sustained a conviction of attempted aggravated assault, an inchoate crime, its analysis categorically applies to other inchoate crimes such as attempted murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    B\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <em>\n    Transferred intent-aggravated assault\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Since attempted aggravated assault and attempted homicide both require specific intent, there was no legal impediment to charging two counts of each crime. An additional complexity arises, however, due to the fact that the aggravated assault crime is disjunctive. Thus, with respect to victim Ms. Kelsey, the Commonwealth could satisfy the elements of the crime by establishing,\n   <em>\n    via\n   </em>\n   transferred intent, that Appellant attempted to cause serious bodily to her, or, in the alternative, that he \"caused [serious bodily] injury intentionally, knowingly or recklessly[.]\" For purposes of sustaining that charge, the jury was required to answer this question: was the bullet that struck Ms. Kelsey actually meant to strike another person? If so, then the intent transfers, and the Commonwealth would not even have to establish serious bodily injury. If, on the other hand, that bullet was fired with no specific intent to hit a person, then Appellant could be found guilty based on the fact he actually caused serious bodily injury\n   <em>\n    via\n   </em>\n   reckless behavior manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life. Appellant avers that the jury could not have determined that the bullet was meant for a person under these circumstances.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Appellant's brief at 16-17 (\"The shooting could have occurred for any myriad of reasons-trying to stop a moving car by shooting the tires, shooting at an attacking stray dog, target practice on a stop sign, firing warning shots, or even shooting at imagined flying monkeys during an intoxicated state.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Appellant does not contest the sufficiency of the evidence regarding Ms. Kelsey. At this juncture, we note that the Commonwealth argued, with respect to Ms. Kelsey, that either theory applied:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   Everyone agrees it is the fundamental principle of this case that Danielle Kelsey was a completely innocent victim, that she had nothing to do with it, that Mr. Palmer was not trying to shoot her. And I have to be honest, Mr. Krouse said and he's right, we will never know who Mr. Palmer was trying to shoot that night, we won't.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   Ladies and gentlemen, that doesn't change what we saw and that doesn't change what happened. He's charged with shooting someone, shooting at someone and hitting Danielle Kelsey.\n   <strong>\n    The reason he's responsible for Danielle Kelsey, even though he wasn't shooting at her it's transferred intent.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   The Judge will instruct you on this because what it says is you don't get to miss and get one for free. Right? If Mr. Krouse is stands up [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] and tries to shoot me and shoots Sam, we don't get to say, oh, but I was shooting for Mr.\n   Krouse. It doesn't count that way. It's ridiculous, that's what we are talking about here. He is shooting at someone, we will never know who. It doesn't matter who because we know what he's doing. We know what he's trying to do. He's trying to very seriously hurt someone. He happens to very seriously hurt Danielle Kelsey. It is aggravated assault on the person Jane Doe or John Doe, we don't know. Maybe an ex-girlfriend, maybe an ex-friend, maybe a rival, I have no idea. Whoever it is he's charged with trying to shoot them and cause them serious bodily injury and he's charged with hitting Danielle Kelsey and causing her serious bodily injury. That's the standard for aggravated assault, that's what I want you to focus on.\n   <strong>\n    Attempting to cause serious bodily injury and causing injury\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   N.T., 8/18/16, at 62-63 (emphases added).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The trial court instructed the jury on both theories.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   . at 85-89. Accordingly, the jury could have determined that Appellant specifically intended to cause serious bodily injury to John Doe, but hit Ms. Kelsey instead. Alternatively, it could have decided that Appellant, while doubtlessly causing serious bodily injury, did so recklessly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    III\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <em>\n    Specific intent as applied to an unidentified victim\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   As in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Thompson\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , the theory in this case was that Appellant's specific intent transferred to Ms. Kelsey. This case is distinguishable from\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Thompson\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , however, in that there is no readily identifiable victim at whom Appellant was firing. Appellant emphasizes that distinction. \"[O]ne can infer that by firing a gun at a crowd of people, the intent is to hit or kill at least someone in the crowd. However, that law does not apply here where there are no facts to support the existence of a single possible human target, let alone a crowd.\" Appellant's brief at 19-20 (citation omitted).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, Appellant argues that he could not possess a specific intent to cause serious bodily injury directed towards\n   <strong>\n    anyone\n   </strong>\n   .

Thus the jury could properly find that the evidence established a specific intent to commit aggravated assault but did not establish the \"greater\" specific intent to kill someone.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Trial Court Opinion, 4/10/17, at 8 n.10 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   We disagree with the learned trial court's analysis. There is no doubt that some acts which are intended to cause serious bodily injury fall short of an intent to kill. However, the trial court did not grant the judgment of acquittal on the basis that the evidence was insufficient to find, as a matter of law, that Appellant's actions could establish an intent to inflict serious bodily injury on an unknown person, yet somehow those some acts could not establish the intent to kill that same person.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rather, the trial court explicitly\n   stated that the Commonwealth failed to produce sufficient evidence that there was any victim as a matter of\n   <strong>\n    fact\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <strong>\n    B\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <em>\n    Presence of a crowd\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Appellant claims that the trial court's ruling is definitive on this point, writing:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   Here, there was no person or persons present to whom specific intent could apply. The trial court even believed the block was empty. How its conclusion transformed from \"empty\" to \"crowded\" when the only change was Palmer's challenge to the conviction is confusing at best. It is also unsupported by the record. Speculation about intent cannot suffice to establish guilt. The conviction for aggravated assault on a John or Jane Doe is insufficient.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Appellant's brief at 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   That argument claims that the trial court's ruling requires this Court to accept that Appellant was shooting at an empty street as a matter of fact to which we apply our conclusions of law. \"Here, the Commonwealth did not establish the presence of a person nor that Appellant knew or incorrectly believed that someone was the target of his assault.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   We disagree, as that argument misapplies our standard of review. As the Commonwealth observes, the trial judge was not the finder of fact. We view the relevant inquiry as encompassing three separate but related questions: Could the jury find that: (1) A group of people was present; (2) Appellant fired into that group; and (3) Appellant fired into the group with the specific intent to inflict serious bodily injury?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Assessed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth as verdict winner, the facts establish that there was a group of people and that Appellant shot in its direction. Appellant fired ten bullets towards the intersection of 17th Street, which runs north to south, and Susquehanna Avenue, which runs east to west. At the time he fired those bullets, Ms. Kelsey, who was driving two friends in her vehicle, turned left at the intersection of Susquehanna and 17th Street. Her vehicle was followed by two other cars containing more of her friends. Approximately five seconds after making a turn onto 17th Street, she heard gunshots. N.T., 8/16/16, at 49. She heard the gunshots from behind her, and felt pain in her back shortly thereafter. These facts constitute sufficient circumstantial evidence that numerous people were present and that Appellant fired in their direction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <strong>\n    C\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <em>\n    Firing into that group sufficiently establishes the requisite intent\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Since we have determined that the jury could find that Appellant fired into a group of people, the remaining question is whether the jury could conclude that Appellant did so with the specific intent to cause serious bodily injury.

Therein, three police officers were investigating a shooting that occurred earlier that day. The victim of that shooting, Charles Wesley, was walking nearby. Five men, including Jackson, approached Wesley and commenced shooting. The three officers plus four other bystanders took cover. We concluded that the evidence was insufficient to sustain seven aggravated assault convictions for those seven persons.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   In his second issue, Appellant questions the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain his convictions for the aggravated assaults of Detective Waring, Officer Hood, Officer Allen, Sharee Norton, Sharron Norton, Shanya Wesley, and Gene Palmer. While Appellant admits that he intended to shoot Wesley, Appellant contends that these other persons were simply in the way. Appellant argues that the Commonwealth failed to establish that he had the specific intent to cause serious bodily injury to any of these persons, and thus, the requisite intent for his aggravated assault convictions is lacking.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   [T]he evidence shows that Detective Waring, Officer Hood, Officer Allen, Sharee Norton, Sharron Norton, Shanya Wesley, and Gene Palmer were near Appellant's intended victim. The evidence also shows that Appellant fired a deadly weapon toward them. There is, however, no other evidence, in the form of circumstances, actions or words, occurring before, during, or after the shooting, that tends to demonstrate that Appellant specifically intended to inflict injury upon these particular persons. Therefore, the only circumstance in the record from which it may be inferred that Appellant had the intent to cause these persons serious bodily injury was his firing a deadly weapon in their direction. Based on the totality of the circumstances, we conclude that the evidence was insufficient to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that Appellant harbored the specific intent to cause serious bodily injury with a deadly weapon to any of these persons.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Jackson\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 445-48.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   We nevertheless upheld the convictions based on\n   <strong>\n    attempted\n   </strong>\n   aggravated assault, relying on\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Thompson\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   . \"It is an established fact that Appellant specifically intended to cause serious bodily injury to Wesley with a deadly weapon.

The Court of Appeal affirmed attempted murder charges as to everyone in both houses-11 counts-even though the defendants may have targeted only one person at each house. \"The jury drew a reasonable inference, in light of the placement of the shots, the number of shots, and the use of high-powered, wall-piercing weapons, that defendants harbored a specific intent to kill every living being within the residences they shot up....

Appellant maintains that, instead, \"[t]he correct method would have been to play the portion of the video showing the shooting, and have the detective describe the time, date, locations, and the directions of movements of the person seen in the video .... That is not what the Commonwealth did.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 23.

The trial court responded to the claim in its opinion as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-111\">\n   Detective Wearing testified that he physically investigated the shooting scene and surrounding neighborhood, and obtained video footage of the area from the time of the shooting. While the jury viewed the videos, Detective Wearing placed the footage in context by describing the intersection that was videotaped, the camera locations, the location of Ms. Kelsey when she was shot, the location of the fired cartridge casings, the location of the narcotics, and the location of the \"suspect\" alleged to be Appellant. Defective Wearing further testified that immediately after viewing the videos on the day following the shooting, he saw Appellant in the shooting area and determined he was the shooter shown in the videotapes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-112\">\n   Overall, Detective Wearing's testimony was relevant to the jury's understanding of the timing of events shown on the videos, the location of the shooter when he fired the gun, the location of the victim (Ms. Kelsey) in relation to the shooter, and the location of Appellant's DNA in relation to where the gun was fired.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See e.g.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   [\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth v.

As the Commonwealth asserted, Detective Wearing's testimony about the surveillance videos explained the basis for Appellant's arrest, the DNA testing of the drugs, and Appellant's question about what the consequences would be if the shooting were accidental. Thus, Detective Wearing's testimony about the videos was based upon his perception of them, placed his subsequent actions in context, and was helpful in allowing the jury to reach a clear understanding of all his testimony.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Crespo\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 182.

Ten people inside a building does not support the Commonwealth's contention that it was a \"busy\" street outside.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   After leaving Yolo's, which is located at the corner of Chadwick Street and Susquehanna Avenue, Ms. Kelsey saw \"another friend\" before entering her automobile on Chadwick Street.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 43, 47.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Only one person on Chadwick Street also fails to support the Commonwealth's contention that it was \"busy\" outside at 2204 North 17th Street, where the ten cartridge casings were recovered and, thus, where the shooter was standing.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Compare\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Commonwealth's Brief at 11-12,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     and\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   TCO at 10-11,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     with\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   N.

N. T., 8/16/16, at 45, 48-49; N. T., 8/17/16, at 36. Ms. Kelsey testified that \"everybody was following me to our next location.\" N. T., 8/16/16, at 48. In other words, any other automobiles from her party were\n   <strong>\n    behind\n   </strong>\n   hers. She was the first one to turn on to North 17th Street. She was only on North 17th Street for \"like five seconds\" when she was shot.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 49. None of the other cars had turned yet, because her vehicle was in front. So, none of the people in those vehicles could be considered \"John Doe\" or part of a \"crowd\" on North 17th Street, as they were not even in the shooter's line of vision. They had not yet turned on to North 17th Street, so there is no reason for the shooter to know they were coming. Also, Ms. Kelsey had waited for everybody else to enter their vehicles before she began to move, meaning that there was not anyone from her party still walking around outside on any of the aforementioned streets.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 42.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   Furthermore, the cartridge casings were discovered north of Susquehanna Avenue; the shooter would have to have been firing south, the same direction as the traffic flow on 17th Street-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , vehicles would not have been approaching him if they turned off Susquehanna Avenue and on to 17th Street. N. T., 8/17/16, at 43-44, 48-51, 113, 117, 120. If Appellant's intent was to shoot someone in Ms. Kelsey's party, it is inexplicable that he was waiting north of Susquehanna Avenue when the party could only turn south on to 17th Street. Additionally, it is incomprehensible why Appellant would have been walking back and forth on the 2200 block of North 17th Street for almost three hours if his intent was to shoot into a crowd turning in a different direction.

However, there is no other context, including whether the streets were busy at that particular time or day when the shooting occurred-\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , an intersection could be busy at 9:00 a.m. on Mondays but not at 11:00 p.m. on Thursdays.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   Based upon my review of the record, I find insufficient evidence to support the majority's assertion that a crowd was present when Appellant fired his weapon so that the jury could infer that Appellant hoped or believed to hit someone in that crowd with one or more bullets.

That's the idea of transferred intent.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-176\">\n    Make no mistake, Danielle Kelsey was not the target on July 16th, 2016, but she's the one whose life was turned upside down because of his actions.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-177\">\n    N. T., 8/16/16, at 31-32.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-178\">\n    In its closing argument, the Commonwealth stated to the jury:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-179\">\n    [Appellant is] charged with aggravated assault and I want to spend a little bit of time talking about transferred intent .... Everyone agrees it is the fundamental principle of this case that Danielle Kelsey was a completely innocent victim, that she had nothing to do with it, that [Appellant] was not trying to shoot her ....\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-180\">\n    The reason he's responsible for Danielle Kelsey, even though he wasn't shooting at her it's transferred intent.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-181\">\n    N. T., 8/18/16, at 62.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-182\">\n    Similarly, the trial court instructed the jury on the doctrine of transferred intent as to shooting of Ms. Kelsey only:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-183\">\n    There is a concept called transferred intent under the law ....\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-184\">\n    If you find beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant intended to kill or cause serious bodily injury to an unknown person or persons and was acting with that intent at the time that he, in fact, caused serious bodily injury to Danielle Kelsey, you may find that the defendant acted with the specific intent to kill or cause serious bodily injury under what the law calls the doctrine of transferred intent.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-185\">\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n    at 88-89.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-186\">\n    I mention that the Commonwealth argued and the trial court instructed that transferred intent only applied from \"John Doe\" to Ms. Kelsey in order to show that the jury were never presented with the option that intent transferred to \"John Doe.\" I am not contending that the jury, in fact, found Appellant guilty of aggravated assault causing serious bodily injury to Ms. Kelsey based on the theory of transferred intent, because the evidence is sufficient to support this conviction based on a\n    <em>\n     mens rea\n    </em>\n    of recklessness. Moreover, Appellant did not contest the sufficiency of the evidence to establish his conviction for aggravated assault causing serious bodily injury to Ms. Kelsey.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
