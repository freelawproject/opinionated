The appellant was instructed to pay the required fee by July 5, 2018 or else his appeal would be dismissed without further notice. The appellant has failed to pay the required fee. Dismissal, therefore, is deemed to be unopposed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   NOW, THEREFORE, IT IS ORDERED that the within appeal is DISMISSED.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
