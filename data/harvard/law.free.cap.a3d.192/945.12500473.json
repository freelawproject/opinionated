He appeals from the denial of his motion to suppress the evidence\n   and he presents one question for our review, which we have rephrased:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-10\">\n   Did the police have reasonable articulable suspicion to stop appellant's vehicle solely for a window-tint violation?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   We shall answer that question in the affirmative and affirm the judgment of conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Appellant was indicted by the Grand Jury for Prince George's County with five offenses: possession of marijuana with intent to distribute, possession of marijuana, possession of methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), and two counts of possession of drug paraphernalia. On the day of trial, counsel informed the court that the parties had reached an agreement, and they would proceed on the charge of possession of marijuana only, with a not guilty plea and an agreed-upon statement of facts. Appellant would litigate his motion to suppress the evidence based upon the lack of probable cause or reasonable grounds for the officer to stop his vehicle, and if the court denied the motion, defense counsel told the court the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   \"If the motion is successful, then obviously the case is over. If it is not successful, if Your Honor finds that a stop was valid, then the parties have an agreed-upon plea as well as a sentencing agreement that we would run by Your Honor.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The trial court heard an agreed-upon statement of facts supporting appellant's motion to suppress and denied the motion, found appellant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, and sentenced appellant to a term of incarceration of one year, all but one day suspended, credit for time served, and eighteen months unsupervised probation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The parties presented the following agreed-upon statement of facts for the court's decision on the motion to suppress, stating as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   \"[THE STATE]: So [appellant] was pulled over pursuant to a traffic stop for a tint violation. There's no dispute that it was violating the Maryland tint law; however, the vehicle was registered in Virginia.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   So [appellant] is arguing that the tint law violation does not apply and, therefore, the basis-there's not sufficient basis for the stop. The State would argue that the vehicle was being driven in Maryland and needed to comply with Maryland law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: That's correct, Your Honor. We stipulate that there was a stop in Prince George's\n   County, the basis of which was as stated in the charging document, for a window tint exceeding Maryland state minimum. And the parties also stipulate that the vehicle was registered and tagged through the Commonwealth of Virginia. And those are the agreed-upon facts.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Following this statement to the court, the parties argued their legal theories to the court, and as indicated, the court denied the motion to suppress. The court reasoned as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   \"I looked at the case and I looked at the law again and I think that when an officer suspects a violation, I think that he is justified in conducting a stop. What he does beyond that, he has a lot of discretion as to whether he issues a citation or how he handles the stop, but I think under the case of\n   <em>\n    Turkes [v.] Maryland\n   </em>\n   , it's clear that a tint violation can provide the reasonable articulable suspicion to justify a stop. I don't think it matters.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Certainly this case didn't deal with it, but the issue is that counsel says it only applies if it's a Maryland vehicle. But I feel that when one comes into Maryland, they have to avail themselves of the laws and that the officer was justified in conducting the stop, which is all that he did at this point after observing the tint violation. So I'm going to deny your motion to suppress.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Following the court's denial of appellant's motion to suppress, the parties presented to the court an agreed statement of fact in lieu of witness testimony.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The stated facts were as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   \"... [O]n May 29th, 2016, at approximately 2300 hours, officers were on patrol when they saw a black Dodge Charger with window tinting exceeding the Maryland state minimum pass through the intersection of Hybrid Avenue and Marlboro Pike. Officers then initiated a traffic stop and came into contact with the driver of the vehicle who later became known to them as [appellant], who is seated to the left of counsel.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   As the officer was speaking with the occupants of the vehicle, they could smell an odor of marijuana emanating from inside the vehicle. The officer asked [appellant] if there was any marijuana in the vehicle and [appellant] said there was a legal amount of about eight grams in the center console.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   A search of the vehicle was subsequently conducted and the officers found, among other things, a black duffle bag containing approximately 747 grams of marijuana. It was subsequently tested by the Prince George's County Drug Lab and did test positive for marijuana. [Appellant] also had $1,745 on him. All events occurred in Prince George's County, Maryland.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The court imposed the agreed-upon sentence, and this timely appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Before this Court, appellant's argument is very simple and straightforward-the police do not have the right, be it reasonable suspicion or probable cause, to stop a vehicle based solely on the window tint unless that vehicle is registered in Maryland under Md. Code, Transportation Article, \u00a7\u00a7 13-902, 13-913, 13-917, or 13-937.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Appellant does not contest that the\n   vehicle tinting on his vehicle exceeded the legal limits set out in \u00a7 22-406, nor does he contest that he was operating on a Maryland highway. He argues solely that because his vehicle was registered in Virginia and not in Maryland, his vehicle was in compliance with \u00a7 22-406.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The State maintains that the police had reasonable articulable suspicion to stop appellant's vehicle based on a window tint violation of either \u00a7 22-406 or \u00a7 22-101(a)(1), which prohibits the operation of any vehicle in an unsafe condition. In the State's view, it matters not that the vehicle was in fact registered in Virginia, or for that matter any other state, because that fact does not impact the officer's reasonable basis to stop the vehicle. Here, the State urges that reasonable suspicion exists for a traffic stop because the windows on appellant's vehicle were darkly tinted as defined by \u00a7 22-406, which the police officer believed to be in violation of Maryland law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In reviewing a trial court's ruling on a motion to suppress, we give deference to the hearing judge's factual findings and review those for clear error; we review legal conclusions\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   in the light most favorable to the prevailing party, in this case, the State.\n   <em>\n    Turkes v.

We conduct this review ordinarily based upon the record created at the suppression hearing, in this case, upon the record made on the agreed statement of facts and the hearing before the judge. Appellant asserts that the hearing judge should have suppressed the marijuana seized by the police because the traffic stop supporting the search was unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The issue we must address in this case is whether the Maryland law enforcement officer had reasonable suspicion to stop appellant's vehicle. We consider the validity of an automobile stop based solely on an officer's belief that the vehicle's windows were illegally tinted in violation of \u00a7 22-406.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution protects citizens \"against unreasonable searches and seizures.\" U.S. CONST . amend.

From the legislative history of the statute, we glean that the primary, underlying purpose of the statute was that because excessively tinted windows prevent officers from perceiving dangers or problems inside the vehicle, the legislation was necessary to protect the safety of law enforcement officers who stop and approach a vehicle.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Statement from the Prince George's Cty.

As the officer exits his cruiser and proceeds toward the tinted-windowed vehicle, he has no way of knowing whether the vehicle's driver is fumbling for his driver's license or reaching for a gun; he does not know whether he is about to encounter a single law-abiding citizen or to be ambushed by a car-full of armed assailants. He literally does not even know whether a weapon has been trained on him from the moment the stop was initiated. As one officer put the obvious: 'If the suspect has a weapon, I might not see it until he rolls down the window. He may just shoot me through the window.' If, as the Court has noted, officers face an 'inordinate risk' every time they approach even a vehicle whose interior and passengers are fully visible to the officers,\n   <em>\n    [Pennsylvania v.] Mimms\n   </em>\n   , 434 U.S. [106] at 110, 98 S.Ct.

In fact, it is out of recognition of just such danger that at least twenty-eight states, including Maryland, have now enacted laws either regulating or altogether prohibiting the use of tinted windows on vehicles in their states.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   (Emphasis in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Presumably, in order to avoid any conflict with the inter-state commerce provisions of the United States Constitution, the Legislature elected to avoid that possibility by limiting the application of the law to vehicles registered only in Maryland under \u00a7\u00a7 13-902, 13-913, 13-917, and 13-937.

Because we find the stop lawful under \u00a7 22-406, we do not address whether the officer could stop the vehicle under the safety provision of \u00a7 22-101(a)(1)(i).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   We are satisfied that the officer's stop of appellant's automobile to investigate the window tinting based upon his belief that the tinting was in excess of the permissible tint in Maryland, and his request for appellant's driver's license and automobile registration as part of the limited traffic stop, were reasonable. The trial court did not err in denying appellant's motion to suppress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The purpose of a stop based upon reasonable suspicion \"is to confirm or to dispel that suspicion by asking for an explanation of the suspicious behavior.\"\n   <em>\n    Muse\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1031344\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/146/395/\">\n    146 Md.

A police officer, suspecting a tint window violation, may lawfully stop a vehicle to investigate further and ask to see the vehicle registration to determine origin of registration. That the vehicle may be registered in a foreign jurisdiction does not vitiate the lawfulness of the stop.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    JUDGMENTS OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY AFFIRMED.

It is clear that the parties intended to waive formal proof and proceed on the agreed statement of fact before the court and not to a jury.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    All subsequent statutory references herein shall refer to Md.

There is no argument before us, or below, that the constitutional standard for the stop should be probable cause rather than reasonable suspicion. Although the question presented herein is whether the police may stop a vehicle solely on the basis of tinted windows (and does not limit the issue to the amount of tint), the record in this case reflects that the officer also stopped appellant for speeding.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
