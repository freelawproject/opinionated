Richard appeals from a judgment of the Superior Court (Oxford County,\n   <em>\n    Clifford, J.\n   </em>\n   ) affirming the decision of the Secretary of State to impose a three-year administrative suspension of Richard's driver's license because of a fatal accident that he caused in 2014.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   5 M.R.S. \u00a7 11008 (2017) ; 29-A M.R.S. \u00a7 2458(2-A) (2017) ; M.R. Civ. P. 80C. Richard challenges (1) the court's determination\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   that, as a matter of law, 29-A M.R.S. \u00a7 2458(2-A) is not punitive or criminal in nature and therefore does not require a higher standard of proof, and (2) the determination of the Secretary of State's Hearing Examiner that Richard's operation at the time of the accident was negligent. We affirm the judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I. BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   [\u00b6 2] The following undisputed facts are taken from the Secretary of State's decision, including the Hearing Examiner's findings, and the procedural facts are drawn from the Superior Court's record.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Manirakiza v. Dep't of Health &amp; Human Servs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12352971\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/177/1264/\">\n    2018 ME 10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 2,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12352971\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/177/1264/\">\n    177 A.3d 1264\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   [\u00b6 3] On July 15, 2014, Richard was driving on a street in Brewer when his vehicle crossed the center line and collided with an oncoming vehicle. Two of the three passengers in his vehicle died as a result of the injuries that they sustained in the collision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   [\u00b6 4] The Secretary of State sent Richard a notice of suspension on May 13, 2016, advising him that, in accordance with 29-A M.R.S. \u00a7 2458(2-A), his license to operate\n   a motor vehicle would be suspended for a period of three years, effective May 27, 2016. Richard requested a hearing to review the suspension, and the hearing was held before a Hearing Examiner on August 15, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   [\u00b6 5] At the hearing, Richard testified that he did not remember the crash, but he asserted that a cardiac event had caused him to lose consciousness. The Hearing Examiner found that there was insufficient evidence in the record to support that theory because \"[h]is physician [was] only able to speculate that a connection between the accident and Mr. Richard's cardiac condition [was] possible. And the hospital records indicate Mr. Richard experienced atrial fibrillation one week\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the accident, with no known prior history of such an event.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   [\u00b6 6] In a decision dated September 7, 2016, the Hearing Examiner upheld the Secretary of State's three-year suspension of Richard's driver's license. The Hearing Examiner found and concluded that Richard negligently operated a motor vehicle when he fell asleep while driving and swerved into oncoming traffic, and determined that Richard's negligent operation of the motor vehicle caused the deaths of two other people. The Hearing Examiner explained that \"[o]ne of the most basic and critical requirements placed on all drivers is to maintain control of the motor vehicle at all times. No external interference caused Mr. Richard to leave his travel lane. As he admitted to [the detective] just hours after the crash, he recognized that he was feeling tired as he drove but elected to keep driving until he reached a truck stop. That decision unfortunately had terrible consequences.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   [\u00b6 7] On October 27, 2016, Richard petitioned the Superior Court for judicial review of final agency action pursuant to 5 M.R.S. \u00a7 11001(1) (2017) and M.R. Civ. P. 80C.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   After holding oral argument, the court affirmed the Secretary of State's decision in an order dated September 26, 2017. Richard filed a motion for reconsideration, which was denied, and Richard timely appealed to us.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   5 M.R.S. \u00a7 11008 ; M.R. App. P. 2B(c)(2)(D).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   II. DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   A. Standard of Proof\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   [\u00b6 8] Richard first argues that 29-A M.R.S. \u00a7 2458(2-A) is punitive in nature and therefore the Secretary of State should have to find negligent operation based on clear and convincing evidence or beyond a reasonable doubt. The Secretary of State applied the preponderance of the evidence standard of proof in accordance with the administrative hearing procedure statute, 29-A M.R.S. \u00a7 2484(3) (2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   [\u00b6 9] The question of whether an offense defined by statute is civil or criminal is a matter of statutory construction,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

After considering these seven factors, we conclude that section 2458(2-A) is not so punitive in purpose and effect as to render it a criminal offense.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1765344\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/372/144/#p168\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   [\u00b6 12] The first factor in our analysis is whether 29-A M.R.S. \u00a7 2458(2-A) involves an affirmative disability or restraint.\n   <em>\n    Anton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7977261\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/463/703/#p705\">\n    463 A.2d at 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Suspension of a driver's license is the revocation of a privilege and is not akin to the disability or restraint on liberty that is caused by arrest and detention.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Savard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7888893\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/659/1265/#p1267\">\n    659 A.2d 1265\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1267-68 (Me. 1995).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   [\u00b6 13] With regard to the second factor, we note that the sanctions imposed by section 2458(2-A) have not \"historically been regarded as a punishment.\"\n   <em>\n    Anton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7977261\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/463/703/#p705\">\n    463 A.2d at 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation marks omitted). We have, however, previously held that \"[r]evocation of the license is nonpunitive in character,\" and is merely intended \"to provide the public with safe roadways.\"\n   <em>\n    Savard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7888893\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/659/1265/#p1267\">\n    659 A.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1268 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Anton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7977261\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/463/703/#p705\">\n    463 A.2d at 707\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[S]uspension of an operator's license does not tend to make the offense criminal if it is not imposed to punish the individual but reflects a judgment that the violator should not continue to drive.\"). Our conclusion in\n   <em>\n    Savard\n   </em>\n   was based on the principle that \"[t]here exists no absolute right to obtain and hold a driver's license. The driver's license is a privilege to which certain rights and responsibilities attach and for valid reasons involving public safety may be granted or withheld.... The suspension of that privilege merely signifies the failure of the holder to comply with the agreed conditions.\"\n   <em>\n    Savard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7888893\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/659/1265/#p1267\">\n    659 A.2d at 1267-68\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   [\u00b6 14] Consideration of the third factor also does not disclose a punitive purpose-the suspension is not imposed based on a finding of scienter associated with the criminal law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Anton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7977261\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/463/703/#p705\">\n    463 A.2d at 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The only requirement for the suspension to become effective is that the offender negligently operated a motor vehicle in a manner that caused the death of another person, and neither knowledge nor intent is an element of negligent operation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   29-A M.R.S. \u00a7 2458(2-A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   [\u00b6 15] With regard to the fourth factor, Richard contends that the Legislature had\n   a punitive objective-retribution and deterrence-when it enacted section 2458(2-A).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Anton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7977261\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/463/703/#p705\">\n    463 A.2d at 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . He points out that the statute requires the Secretary of State to consider statements from victims and their family members, which indicates a punitive purpose similar to that of the criminal law's use of victim impact statements.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   17-A M.R.S. \u00a7 1174 (2017) ;\n   <em>\n    Anton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7977261\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/463/703/#p705\">\n    463 A.2d at 708\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining that \"[s]ome courts have found the legislature's intent to create a civil offense undercut by excessive use of terminology associated with the criminal law\"). He also cites to testimony before the Legislature that emphasized consequences and accountability for negligent drivers, instead of public safety.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   This factor suggests that section 2458(2-A) is punitive in intent, even though it is not punitive in its operation and effect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   [\u00b6 16] As to the fifth factor, the behavior to which section 2458(2-A) applies will not necessarily amount to a crime. As the circumstances here demonstrate, a driver's negligence may result in deaths and yet not result in any criminal prosecution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   [\u00b6 17] Next, we consider the sixth factor-whether section 2458(2-A) has a purpose, other than punishment, that can rationally be associated with it. As set forth above, section 2458(2-A)'s purpose is to promote public safety by providing the public with safe roadways.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Savard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7888893\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/659/1265/#p1267\">\n    659 A.2d at 1268\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   [\u00b6 18] Finally, the seventh factor addresses whether the three-year driver's license suspension is excessive, or reasonable, in relation to the nonpunitive objective of promoting public safety.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Letalien\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7291150\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/985/4/\">\n    2009 ME 130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 51,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7291150\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/985/4/\">\n    985 A.2d 4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As we held in\n   <em>\n    Anton\n   </em>\n   , \"[a] proceeding to revoke a driver's license is a reasonable regulatory measure to protect public safety.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7977261\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/463/703/#p705\">\n    463 A.2d at 707\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . When, as here, a driver's negligent operation of a motor vehicle causes a death, the suspension of that driver's license for three years is a reasonable regulatory measure and is in no way excessive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   [\u00b6 19] Because the factors articulated in\n   <em>\n    Anton\n   </em>\n   weigh heavily in favor of the conclusion that section 2458(2-A) is not so punitive as to be a criminal prosecution, we decline to impose a burden higher than preponderance of evidence and affirm the court's determination of that issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   B. Sufficiency of the Evidence to Support the Suspension\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   [\u00b6 20] Finally, Richard contends that the Hearing Examiner's finding that his operation at the time of the fatal accident\n   was negligent was not supported by substantial evidence in the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   [\u00b6 21] \"When the Superior Court acts in an intermediate appellate capacity pursuant to M.R.

P. 80C, we review the administrative agency's decision directly for errors of law, abuse of discretion, or findings not supported by substantial evidence in the record.\"\n   <em>\n    Melevsky v.

The Hearing Examiner's finding that Richard fell asleep while driving his vehicle is supported by competent evidence. On multiple occasions after the accident, Richard reported that he must have \"dozed off.\" The only circumstance tending to excuse Richard's conduct is his alleged cardiac event, but the Hearing Examiner reasonably concluded that the evidence in the record was insufficient to support that theory. Further, as the Hearing Examiner found with support in the record, regardless of the reason for the fatigue, Richard was aware that he was tired but chose to keep driving, hoping to make it to a truck stop. The Hearing Examiner did not err by concluding that falling asleep while driving and causing the deaths of two people constitutes negligence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The entry is:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Judgment affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    The Secretary of State's Hearing Examiner declined to rule on this issue because she concluded that the determination was beyond her authority.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    Although Richard's petition was filed more than fifty days after the date of the Secretary of State's decision and was therefore potentially untimely, there is no evidence in the record before us to establish when Richard received the Secretary of State's decision.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    5 M.R.S. \u00a7 11002(1), (3) (2017) (\"The petition for review shall be filed within 30 days\n    <em>\n     after receipt\n    </em>\n    of notice ....\" (emphasis added) ).
