Other features of the ordinance are not material here. Prosecutor had no Paterson license, and under the terms of the ordinance was not eligible for one, being a resident of Newark. He claims that his application for license was refused. The testimony in the Beeorder\u2019s Court, however, is not before us, and the depositions are unavailable. <em>South, Brunswick </em>v. <em>Cranbury, </em>52 N. <em>J. L. </em>298. Prosecutor was fined $50 as provided in the ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>We think the restriction of a license to residents was unreasonable and illegal. A number of cases on this point are collected in <em>Westfield </em>v. <em>Stein, </em>113 <em>N. J. L. </em>1 (at <em>p. </em>3). But the point is not strictly before us. Prosecutor admittedly had no license. He asserts now that he applied for one and was refused on the ground of non-residence, and, as already noted, made that defense in the Recorder\u2019s Court. But if so\u2019made, it-was not a defense there, for if the refusal was unwarranted, his remedy was by <em>mandamus </em>and not by doing business unlicensed. He could claim no higher privilege than a resident, <em>i. </em>e., to a status for licensing purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">However, the conviction must be set aside because of the illegal penalty, fixed at $50, no more, no less. This is in violation of section 7 of article 10 of the Home Rule act <em>(Pamph. L. </em>1917 (at <em>p. </em>347); <em>Cum. Supp. Comp. Stat. </em>1911-1924, <em>p. </em>2105, \u00a7 *136-1007), authorizing imprisonment not exceeding ninety days, or fine not exceeding $200, or both, with power to the magistrate to impose punishment within those limits. The ordinance antedates the statute, but that does not help the matter. <em>La Forgia </em>v. <em>Hoboken, </em>10 <em>N. J. Mis. R. </em>657. The recorder made a decision in .writing citing this case, but disregarded it.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">The conviction is set aside, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
