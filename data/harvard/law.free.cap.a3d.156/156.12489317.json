On appeal, the defendants argue that the trial court erred when it determined that the completed rubrics are not exempt from disclosure under the Right-to-Know Law as \"[r]ecords pertaining to internal personnel practices.\" RSA 91-A:5, IV (Supp. 2016). We reverse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Although the defendants also argue that the trial court erroneously determined that the completed rubric forms are not exempt as documents \"whose disclosure would constitute an invasion of privacy,\"\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   ., we need not address that argument because we rule in the defendants' favor upon their first argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    I. Facts\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The facts relevant to whether the completed rubric forms constitute \"[r]ecords pertaining to internal personnel practices,\"\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   ., are as follows. While reviewing the process by which the City's school board hired a new school superintendent, the plaintiff, an Alton resident, discovered what he viewed to be violations of the Right-to-Know Law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   RSA ch. 91-A (2013 &amp; Supp. 2016). In April 2014, he requested from the interim superintendent of schools a copy of the blank rubric form used by, and copies of the forms completed by, the school board's superintendent search committee members when evaluating candidates for the superintendent position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The interim superintendent of schools sent the plaintiff a copy of a blank rubric form, but stated that he would not supply the completed forms, in part, because they pertain to internal personnel practices and matters, namely, \"the consideration of applicants and the hiring of an employee.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   According to the blank form, the superintendent search committee rated applicants on a scale of 1-4 in 12 categories: (1) \"Cert or certifiable as Supt in NH\"; (2) \"Degree\"; (3) \"Administrative Experience\"; (4) \"Regional School District Experience\"; (5) \"Communication/PR\"; (6) \"Data Driven Decisions\"; (7) \"Budget Development &amp; Implementation\"; (8) \"Instr/Curr/Assess/Eval\"; (9) \"Professional Development\"; (10) \"Strategic Planning &amp; Goal Settings\"; (11) \"Technology Integration\"; and (12) \"Wild Card.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   For six of those categories, the form instructs how committee members must score applicants. For instance, in the category \"Cert or certifiable as Supt in NH,\" the form instructs that an applicant should receive a \"4\" for being certified in New Hampshire or elsewhere and a \"3\" for being \"[c]ertifiable in NH.\" Similarly, in the category \"Degree,\" an applicant should receive a \"4\" for a doctorate degree, a \"3\" for a master's degree, and a \"2\" for a bachelor's degree. The other four categories for which the form provides scoring instruction are: \"Administrative Experience\"; \"Regional School District Experience\"; \"Budget Development &amp; Implementation\"; and \"Instr/Curr/Assess/Eval.\" The form provides no scoring instruction for the remaining six categories. The form states that a total of 48 points is possible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Thereafter, the plaintiff petitioned the trial court for injunctive relief, requesting that the court order the defendants to disclose the names of the candidates who applied for the superintendent position and\n   the rubric forms completed by the search committee members who evaluated those candidates. In May 2015, the trial court ordered the defendants to disclose the applicants' names. The defendants do not challenge this part of the May 2015 order on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The court also ordered the defendants to file the completed rubric forms under seal in order for it to \"determine whether all or any part of [them] is exempt from disclosure.\" The defendants unsuccessfully moved for reconsideration of the court's May 2015 order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In November 2015, the defendants filed the completed rubric forms under seal. Most of them merely contain the numerical scores that an individual search committee member, or the committee as a whole, gave the applicants. However, some also contain a search committee member's handwritten or typewritten comments about an applicant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In its February 2016 order from which the defendants now appeal, the trial court ordered the completed rubric forms to be disclosed. The court stated that, because the school district voluntarily gave the plaintiff a blank form, \"whether that document could be considered an internal one related to hiring is not at issue.\" With respect to the completed forms, the court decided that the ratings given to applicants \"are not test scores or examination results, but are based on factors considered by committee members,\" and, therefore, \"do not deal with personnel rules or practices as that term is used\" in the Right-to-Know Law. Accordingly, the court concluded that the completed rubric forms are not exempt from disclosure under the exemption for \"internal personnel practices.\" RSA 91-A:5, IV. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   After briefing was completed in this case, we decided\n   <em>\n    Reid v.

We now limit our analysis to the arguments the plaintiff raises in his supplemental memorandum. Specifically, we do not address the plaintiff's argument made in his opening brief that the exemption under the Right-to-Know Law for records pertaining to internal personnel practices is not separate from the exemption for \"personnel ... or ... other files whose disclosure would constitute invasion of privacy.\" RSA 91-A:5, IV.

Thus, we clarified that an investigation into employee misconduct relates to \"internal personnel practices\" when it \"take[s] place within the limits of an employment relationship[;] [i]n other words, the investigation must be conducted by, or ... on behalf of, the employer of the investigation's target.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at ----,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=152%20A.3d%20860\">\n    152 A.3d 860\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (slip op. at 11) ;\n   <em>\n    see Fenniman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2298504\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nh/136/624/#p626\">\n    136 N.H. at 626\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=620%20A.2d%201039\">\n    620 A.2d 1039\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that documents compiled during an internal investigation of a police officer's misconduct pertained to internal personnel practices);\n   <em>\n    see also Hounsell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8399231\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nh/154/1/#p4\">\n    154 N.H. at 4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=903%20A.2d%20987\">\n    903 A.2d 987\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (investigative report by employer's legal counsel regarding an employee's alleged misconduct pertained to internal personnel practices). The Supreme Court has explained that for information to be deemed \"internal\" within the meaning of Exemption 2 of the FOIA, \"the agency must typically keep the records to itself for its own use.\"\n   <em>\n    Milner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12457268,5989278\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/562/562/\">\n    562 U.S. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   570-71 n.4,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12457268,5989278\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/562/562/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 1259\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, the completed rubric forms are \"internal\" because they were filled out by members of the school board's superintendent search committee on behalf of the school board, the entity that employs the superintendent.\n   <em>\n    See Reid\n   </em>\n   , 169 N.H. at ----,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=152%20A.3d%20860\">\n    152 A.3d 860\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (slip op. at 11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The plaintiff argues that the completed forms do not pertain to \"internal\" personnel practices because \"no employment relationship exist[s] between the applicant and the school board.\" He contends that \"all the information that is presented by [an] applicant in the course [of] an interview process is necessarily external because it originates from outside the relationship.\" He asserts that the completed forms are, therefore, unlike \"information gathered internally, such as job performance reviews, disciplinary reports, and compensation.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The plaintiff too narrowly construes our decision in\n   <em>\n    Reid\n   </em>\n   . The issue in\n   <em>\n    Reid\n   </em>\n   was whether documents pertaining to the investigation by the New Hampshire Attorney General into alleged wrongdoing by former Rockingham County Attorney James Reams constituted internal personnel practices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at ----,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=152%20A.3d%20860\">\n    152 A.3d 860\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (slip op. at 1-2, 6-7). In that context, we held that documents related to an investigation into alleged misconduct constitute \"internal personnel practices\" only when the investigation is \"conducted on behalf of the employer of the investigation's target.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at ----,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=152%20A.3d%20860\">\n    152 A.3d 860\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (slip op. at 13). Because the relationship between the attorney general and a county attorney lacked \"the usual attributes of an employer-employee relationship,\" we concluded that the attorney general was not Reams's employer, and, thus, that the documents did not pertain to internal personnel practices within the meaning of the Right-to-Know Law.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at ----,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=152%20A.3d%20860\">\n    152 A.3d 860\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (slip op. at 13).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In this case, by contrast, the applicants were evaluated on behalf of the entity that employs the school superintendent. Because this case involves hiring and not investigation into misconduct, it is immaterial that there is no employment relationship between the applicants and the City. The information provided by the applicants to the superintendent search committee was gathered in the course of the hiring process, a process that was internal to the search committee and conducted on behalf of the superintendent's employer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Because the completed rubric forms pertain to \"internal personnel practices\" they are exempt from disclosure under the Right-to-Know Law.\n   <em>\n    See id\n   </em>\n   . at ----,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=152%20A.3d%20860\">\n    152 A.3d 860\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (slip op. at 15) (explaining that we do not apply a balancing test to determine whether materials related to internal personnel practices are exempt from disclosure under the Right-to-Know Law);\n   <em>\n    see also Fenniman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2298504\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nh/136/624/#p626\">\n    136 N.H. at 627\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=620%20A.2d%201039\">\n    620 A.2d 1039\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that the balancing test that we apply to other exemptions under the Right-to-Know Law, which weighs the benefits of nondisclosure against the benefits of disclosure, \"is inappropriate\" when determining whether documents pertaining to internal personnel practices are exempt from disclosure because \"the legislature has plainly made its own determination\" that such \"documents are categorically exempt\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <em>\n    Reversed\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   HICKS, CONBOY, LYNN, and BASSETT, JJ., concurred.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
