(Flightsafety), a flight training school, under the New Jersey Law Against Discrimination,\n   <em>\n    N.J.S.A.\n   </em>\n   10:5-12 to -49 (LAD).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   In rendering its verdict, the jury found that defendant fired plaintiff due to his disability and as a reprisal for seeking accommodation of his disability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The jury awarded defendant back pay of about $83,000, but awarded nothing for pain and suffering, apparently rejecting plaintiff's testimony that he was emotionally devastated by the loss of his job. The trial judge reduced the back pay award by about $14,000, representing fifty percent of the unemployment compensation plaintiff had received. A second judge heard the counsel fee motions and awarded plaintiff's trial counsel about $275,000 in fees and costs, and awarded about $104,500 in fees and costs to the law firm that represented plaintiff prior to trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff appeals, contending that the trial judge erred in offsetting his back pay award by fifty percent of his unemployment compensation, dismissing his punitive damages claim at the close of the trial evidence, dismissing his separate claim against defendant for failure to accommodate his disability, dismissing the individual defendants, and declining to recuse herself from post-trial motions other than the counsel fee applications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Defendant cross-appeals, arguing that the judge should have offset the back pay award by the entire amount of plaintiff's unemployment compensation, plaintiff failed to prove a prima facie case of discrimination, and the verdict was against the weight of the evidence. Defendant further contends that the trial judge erred in excluding evidence of plaintiff's prior lawsuits and in recusing herself from hearing the fee motions, and that the second judge awarded an excessive amount of fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   We hold that the collateral source statute,\n   <em>\n    N.J.S.A.\n   </em>\n   2A:15-97, does not apply to LAD cases, and we find no other basis on which to deduct unemployment compensation from back pay awarded\n   under the LAD. Therefore, we reverse that portion of the judgment reducing plaintiff's back pay award by one-half of the unemployment compensation he received. We remand for the limited purpose of entering an amended judgment reflecting that modification. In all other respects, we affirm on the appeal and the cross-appeal.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    [At the direction of the court, Parts I and III, which are not deemed to war\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    rant publication,\n    <em>\n     seeR.\n    </em>\n    1:36-2(d), have been omitted from the published version.]\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Next, we address whether plaintiff's back pay award should be offset by the amounts of unemployment compensation he received. After his termination from Flightsafety, plaintiff was unemployed for eleven months, during which he received unemployment benefits. He then obtained a position as a pilot instructor with another company, at a higher salary than he was earning at Flightsafety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Defendant argues that the entire amount of unemployment benefits plaintiff received should have been deducted from the back pay award; plaintiff contends that none of it should have been deducted. Amicus curiae National Employment Lawyers Association of New Jersey, Inc. supports plaintiff's position that unemployment benefits should not be deducted from back pay awarded under the LAD.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The trial court reduced plaintiff's back pay award by one-half of the unemployment benefits he received, reasoning that this result was equitable because both the employer and the employee had contributed to the State unemployment fund.

There the court held that the defendant was not entitled to a mitigation of damages by the amount of unemployment compensation received by the plaintiff. Although the court recognized that mitigation is \"always a matter to be considered where contract damages are in issue,\" the court held that the employer should not have a benefit conferred upon him when he is the wrongdoer.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 456, 459,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=324%20A.2d%2071\">\n    324\n    <em>\n     A\n    </em>\n    .2d 71\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

More than fifty years ago, the United States Supreme Court construed the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) as providing that unemployment compensation is not to be deducted from back pay awards in unfair labor cases.\n   <em>\n    NLRB v.

The Court rejected an argument that the rule gave the employee an unjustified windfall:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   Payments of unemployment compensation were not made to the employees by respondent but by the state out of state funds derived from taxation. True, these taxes were paid by employers, and thus to some extent respondent helped to create the fund. However, the payments to the employees were not made to discharge any liability or obligation of respondent, but to carry out a policy of social betterment for the benefit of the entire state. We think these facts plainly show the benefits to be collateral. It is thus apparent from what we have already said that failure to take them into account in ordering back pay does not make the employees more than \"whole\" as that phrase has been understood and applied.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 364,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6931411\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/340/361/#p365\">\n    71\n    <em>\n     S.Ct.\n    </em>\n    at 340\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=95%20L.%20Ed.%20337\">\n    95\n    <em>\n     L.Ed.\n    </em>\n    at 342\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In construing Title VII, which was based on the NLRA, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals held that unemployment benefits may not be deducted from back pay awards under Title VII.\n   <em>\n    Craig\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1908843\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/721/77/#p83\">\n    721\n    <em>\n     F.\n    </em>\n    2d at 82-83\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

There is no reason why the benefit should be shifted to the defendant, thereby depriving the plaintiff of the advantage it confers. This policy also may have somewhat punitive undertones, as it focuses on what the defendant should pay rather than on what the plaintiff should receive.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   [\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   (citations omitted).]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Additionally, the court reasoned that the rule furthered the purpose of Title VII to deter employers from engaging in discrimination. \"A rule precluding deduction of unemployment benefits from a back pay award would further the two key objectives of Title VII's back pay provision, ... to end employment discrimination and secondarily to compensate injured victims in a make whole fashion.\"\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gelof v.
