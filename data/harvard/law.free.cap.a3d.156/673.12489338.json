In this case, what Henrry P. B.-P. (Henrry) faces, because of Connecticut's current statutory structure, is his inability to have the Probate Court consider and make the findings that are necessary for him to petition the federal government to remain in this country. The law that we are constrained to apply, as an intermediate appellate court, in our plenary review of the relevant legal issues raised in these consolidated appeals is set forth in two recent Supreme Court opinions,\n   <em>\n    In re Jose B.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12174366\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/303/569/\">\n    303 Conn. 569\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20A.3d%20975\">\n    34 A.3d 975\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012), and\n   <em>\n    In re Jessica M.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12174390\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/303/584/\">\n    303 Conn. 584\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20A.3d%201072\">\n    35 A.3d 1072\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012).

We conclude, on the basis of that law, that after Henrry reached the age of majority, the Probate Court lacked statutory authority to make the findings required by the petitions filed by his mother, the petitioner, Reyna P. A., to appoint a coguardian for Henrry, and to consider and make the special immigration juvenile status (juvenile status) findings permitted by General Statutes \u00a7 45a-608n (b) for minor children. Accordingly, we affirm the judgments of the Superior Court dismissing the appeals from the decisions of the Probate Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following factual and procedural history is relevant to these appeals. Approximately five weeks before Henrry reached age eighteen, the petitioner, on March 1, 2016, filed a petition in the Probate Court seeking the removal of his deceased father as his guardian and the appointment of a nonrelative, her boyfriend, Santos O. R., as coguardian of Henrry with her. The petitioner represented in that petition that Henrry had been abandoned by his father in the sense that he had failed to\n   maintain a reasonable degree of interest, concern or responsibility for Henrry's welfare; that Henrry had been denied the care, guidance or control necessary for his physical, educational, moral, or emotional well-being as a result of acts of parental commission or omission as defined by law; and that Henrry was neglected or uncared for, as defined in General Statutes \u00a7 46b-120. Also on March 1, 2016, the petitioner filed a petition for special immigrant juvenile findings under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201101\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (27) (J) (2012). Despite the petitioner's request, the Probate Court did not take action prior to Henrry's eighteenth birthday on either of the petitions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The first appeal to the Superior Court filed by the petitioner and Henrry was from the denial of the petition to the Probate Court seeking emergency relief before Henrry reached the age of majority and ceased to be a juvenile. On May 19, 2016, the Superior Court for Juvenile Matters dismissed that appeal for lack of jurisdiction, and on June 2, 2016, the petitioner and Henrry filed the appeal in AC 39276 in this court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In their first appellate brief to this court, the petitioner and Henrry set forth the following additional facts and procedural history: \"This appeal stems from the Juvenile Court's dismissal of the ... appeal\n   from Probate Court, in which the Probate Court denied ... [Henrry] then a minor child, and his mother, [the petitioner], the opportunity to be heard before Henrry turned eighteen years old, and to obtain necessary [juvenile status] findings, based on a misinterpretation of Connecticut's 2014 [juvenile status] findings statute, \u00a7 45a-608n.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \"[The petitioner] and her two minor children, Henrry and [his sister], are from Honduras. After her husband and father-in-law were brutally murdered by the same group of individuals, [the petitioner] fled Honduras, seeking safety in the United States and leaving her two\n   minor children behind with their paternal grandmother because they were too young to make the treacherous journey into the [United States]. As the children grew into adolescents, the threats against them began to escalate as well.... Eventually, fearing for their lives, the two minor siblings, unbeknownst to relatives, decided to embark on their own journey into the United States to find their mother and seek refuge....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \"Upon entering the United States in 2015, Henrry and [his sister] were detained by Immigration Customs and Border Patrol and then ultimately released to [the petitioner] in Connecticut. They were seventeen and sixteen years old at that time. Since arriving in Connecticut, both minors have resided with [the petitioner] and the proposed coguardian in this case, [Santos O. R.], and have been enrolled in ... high school, where Henrry recently completed tenth grade.... Both [the petitioner] and [Santos O. R.] work full-time to support the needs of Henrry and his siblings....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \"On March 1, 2016, approximately five weeks prior to Henrry's eighteenth birthday, [the petitioner], through counsel, initiated the underlying Probate Court action. On that date, she filed a petition for removal of guardian, to remove her minor children's father as guardian and affirm herself as guardian, and additionally seeking the appointment of [Santos O. R.] as her coguardian.... On that date, she also filed a petition for special immigrant juvenile status [ (juvenile status) ] findings under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201101\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [ (a) (27) (J) (2012) ], pursuant to \u00a7 45a-608n, to be used in connection with an application to the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services [ (Immigration Services) ].... Finally, on that date, [the petitioner] filed a motion for waiver of study by the Department of Children and Families [ (department) ] for Henrry, notifying the Probate Court that Henrry would be turning eighteen in approximately five weeks, and that time was of the essence....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \"In her motion for waiver of the [department] study, [the petitioner] stated that Henrry was currently without legal status in the United States and [was] seeking findings from the court in connection with an application for [juvenile status] through [Immigration Services].... She explained that the child had fled his country of origin of Honduras due to threatened violence against his life and that of his sister; that the father and paternal grandfather of the minor child[ren] were both murdered by the same individuals who are now seeking to murder him and his sister as well; that it was not in the child's best interest to be returned to his country of origin where he will be placed at risk of imminent death.... She further claimed that no [department] study was needed here where the child was found to be in good health, was currently in the care of his biological mother and the proposed coguardian, [Santos O. R.], who have the emotional and physical ability to care for the minor, have the financial resources to care for the minor, and neither of which have a history of child abuse or neglect investigations or substantiations.... Finally, her motion stated that Henrry was\n   over the age of twelve years old and consented to the petitions and relief sought, and was emotionally connected with [her], who would remain as guardian of the child.... Her motion concluded that it was in the best interest of the child to expedite the underlying petitions, indicating that the requirement to have the commissioner of [the department] complete a study would cause unreasonable delay that could prohibit this child from seeking relief from [Immigration Services] to obtain legal immigration status....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \"On March 23, 2016, the Probate Court issued its first order of notice of hearing in this case indicating that the matter was being set down for a hearing with 'no appearance necessary' by the parties on April 22, 2016,\n   a date after Henrry's eighteenth birthday.... The Probate Court also [sent notice to] a [department] social work supervisor, ordering [the department] to complete a study for both minors on the petition for removal, and impliedly denying [the petitioner's] motion for the waiver of study by [the department] for Henrry....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \"On April 1, 2016, with Henrry's eighteenth birthday closely approaching, with no [department] study and no hearing date, [the petitioner] filed an emergency petition for findings under \u00a7 45a-608n, the [juvenile status] statute.... In her motion, [the petitioner] requested that the court make findings in connection with her petition for [juvenile status] findings, or, in the alternative, hold an emergency hearing before Henrry's eighteenth birthday, in order to do so.... The attorney for the child, appointed by the Probate Court, Attorney Frank Twohill, having received a copy of the Emergency Petition, visited with the child and wrote a letter to the court indicating both his support for the Petition, and his availability for an evidentiary hearing on the emergency petition, should the court choose to hold one....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \"On April 1, 2016, the Probate Court [\n   <em>\n    Chadwick, J.\n   </em>\n   ,] denied the emergency petition in a brief written order, indicating that: 'The Emergency Petition for Findings under [\u00a7] 45a-608n, dated April 1, 2016, is hereby DENIED by the court. Pursuant to [\u00a7] 45a-608n (b), the granting of a petition to remove is a prerequisite to making the requested written findings.' ... Henrry subsequently turned eighteen a few days later, before any hearing was ever held in the Probate Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \"On April 22, 2016, [the petitioner] and Henrry (now eighteen years old) jointly filed an appeal to Superior Court for Juvenile Matters pursuant to [General Statutes \u00a7] 45a-186 (a) and Practice Book \u00a7 10-76 (a), appealing both the March 23, 2016 order, setting a 'no appearance'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   hearing after Henrry's eighteenth birthday and impliedly denying [the petitioner's] motion for waiver of the study by [the department], and the April 1, 2016 order, denying the emergency petition for findings under [\u00a7] 45a-608n.... The [appeal] raised three claims: (1) that the Probate Court had misinterpreted \u00a7 45a-608n (b) by concluding that it could not make [juvenile status] findings without deciding the underlying petition on removal of a guardian and appointment of a coguardian; (2) that the Probate Court had violated due process by failing to set a hearing prior to Henrry's eighteenth birthday, thus denying the [petitioner and Henrry] an opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner; and (3) that the Probate Court had abused its discretion.... [The petitioner and Henrry] requested that the Juvenile Court reverse the Probate Court and remand for a hearing on [juvenile status] findings.... The Juvenile Court set the matter down for a hearing on May 19, 2016, and another attorney was appointed for Henrry as attorney for the minor child....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \"On May 19, 2016, the Juvenile Court [\n   <em>\n    Dannehy, J.\n   </em>\n   ,] dismissed the appeal from Probate Court on the record, without holding an evidentiary hearing, stating that the Juvenile Court lacked jurisdiction over the appeal, because Henrry was now eighteen years old....

In its report, [the department] indicated its support for the pending petitions, asking that the court grant the petition to remove the father as guardian, to affirm [the petitioner] as guardian, and to appoint [Santos O. R.] as coguardian of Henrry and his [sister]....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \"On June 3, 2016, the Probate Court issued another order for notice of hearing, this time scheduling an actual hearing date for the underlying petitions for July 19, 2016, but the hearing was set down for [Henrry's sister] ... and not for Henrry.... On June 22, 2016, [the petitioner] filed a motion to schedule hearing or for a dispositive order in Henrry's case.... The Probate Court responded to the motion by scheduling a hearing on the underlying petitions for Henrry on July 19, 2016, along with that of his younger sister ....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \"On July 19, 2016, the Probate Court held a full hearing for both Henrry and his sister, first entertaining legal argument from counsel on the jurisdictional issue regarding Henrry's case, now that he is eighteen, and then taking testimony on the substantive issues from all the interested parties. The matter was then taken under advisement ....\" (Citations omitted; footnotes omitted.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On August 30, 2016, the Probate Court mailed its decision affirming the petitioner as sole guardian, but denying her petition for removal of the father as guardian and the appointment of Santos O. R. as coguardian of Henrry because Henrry was eighteen years old and no longer a minor child. It declined to make the requested juvenile status findings, also because Henrry was age eighteen and no longer a minor child. On September 26, 2016, the petitioner and Henrry filed a second appeal to the Superior Court for Juvenile Matters from the Probate Court's August 30, 2016 decision, and on November 1, 2016, that appeal was dismissed. On November 4, 2016, the petitioner and Henrry appealed to this court. The two appeals were consolidated and the petitioner and Henrry were allowed to file a supplemental brief. That brief contained a supplemental statement of facts and procedural history as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \"This account supplements the statement of facts in the ... opening brief in AC 39276.

The appeal in AC 39787 challenges the Probate Court's final orders denying [the petitioner's] petitions because Henrry had turned eighteen, which were appealed to the Juvenile Court ... and dismissed on November 1, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \"The underlying petitions filed by [the petitioner] on March 1, 2016, for removal of Henrry's deceased parent as guardian and appointment of [Santos O.

The [department's] study was returned to the Probate Court approximately two months after Henrry's eighteenth birthday.

This court granted that motion and allowed for this supplemental brief.\" (Citations omitted; footnotes omitted.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   We assume in deciding these consolidated appeals that the statements of facts and procedural history set forth previously are reasonably accurate. We also take note of the statements of counsel during oral argument before this court that Henrry and his sister had arrived in the United States from Honduras approximately eight months prior to the filing of the petitions in the Probate Court, and that the petitioner had contacted such counsel approximately one month prior to the eventual filing of the petitions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The claims\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   raised in these appeals arise from and depend on several statutes set forth in chapter 802h\n   of the General\n   Statutes, which pertains to protected persons, including minors or minor children. Our review is therefore plenary.\n   <em>\n    In re Jose B.\n   </em>\n   , supra, 303 Conn. at 580,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20A.3d%20975\">\n    34 A.3d 975\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Part II of chapter 802h relates to guardianship of minors. Pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 45a-604 (4), \"minor\" or \"minor child\" means a person under the age of eighteen. Pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 45a-604 (5), \"guardianship\" means guardianship of the person of a minor. Pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 45a-606, the biological father and mother are joint guardians of the person of the minor, and the powers, rights, and duties of the father and the mother in regard to the minor are equal. If either the father or the mother dies or is\n   removed as guardian, the other parent becomes the sole guardian of the person of the minor child. General Statutes \u00a7 45a-606. In this case, therefore, on the date the petitioner filed the petitions she, pursuant to \u00a7 45a-606, was Henrry's sole guardian because his father was and had been deceased before he arrived in the United States. There is no mention in that statute, in \u00a7 45a-608n, or in any other of the statutes in part II of chapter 802h, of any statutory authority granted to Connecticut courts to take action with respect to a person who has reached the age of majority. Section 45a-608n by its terms applies solely during the minority of any child.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   General Statutes \u00a7 45a-609 (a) provides in relevant part: \"Upon application for removal of a parent or parents as guardian, the court shall set a time and place for hearing to be held within thirty days of the application, unless the court requests an investigation in accordance with the provisions of section 45a-619. In that case, the court shall set a day for hearing not more than thirty days following receipt of the results of the investigation....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   General Statutes \u00a7 45a-616 provides in relevant part: \"(b) If any minor has a parent or guardian, who is the sole guardian of the person of the child, the court of\n   probate for the district in which the minor resides may, on the application of the parent or guardian of such child or of the Commissioner of Children and Families with the consent of such parent or guardian and with regard to a child within the care of the commissioner, appoint one or more persons to serve as coguardians of the child. When appointing a guardian or guardians under this subsection, the court shall take into consideration the standards provided in section 45a-617....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \"(c) Upon receipt by the court of an application pursuant to this section, the court shall set a time and place for a hearing to be held within thirty days of the application, unless the court requests an investigation in accordance with the provisions of section 45a-619, in which case the court shall set a day for hearing not more than thirty days following receipt of the results of the investigation. The court shall order notice of the hearing to be given to the minor, if over twelve years of age, by first class mail at least ten days prior to the date of the hearing. In addition, notice by first class mail shall be given to the petitioner and all other parties in interest known by the court.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   General Statutes \u00a7 45a-617 provides that \"[w]hen appointing a guardian, coguardians or permanent guardian of the\n   person of a minor, the court shall take into consideration the following factors: (1) The ability of the prospective guardian, coguardians or permanent guardian to meet, on a continuing day to day basis, the physical, emotional, moral and educational needs of the minor; (2) the minor's wishes, if he or she is over the age of twelve or is of sufficient maturity and capable of forming an intelligent preference; (3) the existence or nonexistence of an established relationship between the minor and the prospective guardian, coguardians or permanent guardian; and (4) the best interests of the child. There shall be a rebuttable presumption that appointment of a grandparent or other relative related\n   by blood or marriage as a guardian, coguardian or permanent guardian is in the best interests of the minor child.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The petitioner alleged in her petition for removal of Henrry's father as guardian classic neglect allegations: that Henrry had been abandoned; that he had been denied the care, guidance or control necessary for his physical, educational, moral, or emotional well-being as a result of acts of parental commission or omission as defined by law; and that Henrry was neglected or uncared for, as defined in \u00a7 46b-120. General Statutes \u00a7 45a-619 provides in relevant part: \"In any proceeding under sections 45a-603 to 45a-624, inclusive, in which the applicant has alleged that the minor has been abused or neglected, as those terms are defined in section 46b-120, or in which the probate judge has reason to believe that the minor may have been abused or neglected, the Court of Probate\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     shall request\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   the Commissioner of Children and Families or any organization, agency or individual licensed or approved by the commissioner, to make an investigation and written report to it, within ninety days from the receipt of such request, unless the request concerns an application for immediate temporary custody or temporary custody, in which case the commissioner shall render the report by such date as is reasonably ordered by the court. The report shall indicate the physical, mental and emotional status of the minor and shall contain such facts as may be relevant to the court's determination of whether the proposed court action will be in the best interests of the minor, including the physical, social, mental, and financial condition of the parties, and such other factors which the commissioner or agency finds relevant to the court's determination of whether the proposed action will be in the best interests of the minor....\" (Emphasis added.) Because of the petitioner's allegations in her petition for removal of guardian, \u00a7 45a-619 mandated the Probate\n   Court to request an investigation and report. This mandate is made clear by additional language in \u00a7 45a-619 : \"In any other proceeding under sections 45a-603 to 45a-624, inclusive, the court shall request an investigation and report\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     unless this requirement is waived for cause shown.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   \" (Emphasis added.) The authority of the Probate Court to waive the investigation and report thus is limited to cases not involving allegations of abuse or neglect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   As previously set forth, the petitioner had petitioned for the removal of the father as guardian by alleging that Henrry had been abandoned by his father; had been denied the care, guidance or control necessary for his physical, educational, moral, or emotional well-being as a result of acts of parental commission or omission as defined by law; and that Henrry was neglected or uncared for, as defined in \u00a7 46b-120.

As the current revision of \u00a7 46b-120 (1) indicates, when the legislature intends that a person will be considered a child for certain purposes after the person has reached the age of eighteen years, it knows how to make that intention clear.\").\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n <opinion type=\"dissent\">\n  <author id=\"p-47\">\n   LAVINE, J., dissenting.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   I respectfully disagree with the majority that Connecticut's current statutory structure prevented the Probate Court from making the findings necessary for Henrry P. B.-P. (Henrry) to petition the federal government to remain in this country. By failing to hold an expedited hearing and timely rule on the petition seeking the removal of Henrry's guardian and appointment of a coguardian, and the petition for special immigrant juvenile findings, as it was permitted to do by statute and its own rules, the Probate Court itself frustrated and undermined the legislative intent of this state's special immigrant juvenile status findings statute, General Statutes \u00a7 45a-608n, leading to the dismissal of the petitions. Moreover, by failing to hold an expedited hearing and to rule on the petitions prior to the day Henrry turned eighteen, I believe that the Probate Court abused its discretion and thus violated the rights of the petitioner, Reyna P. A., and Henrry to due process under the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and article first, \u00a7 10, of the constitution of Connecticut. By failing to invoke its equitable\n   jurisdiction to expedite the proceedings, the Probate Court potentially has caused Henrry and the petitioner irreparable harm by exposing Henrry to possible deportation to his country of nationality where he has been subject to death threats.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   I therefore would reverse the judgment of dismissal and remand\n   the matter for further proceedings nunc pro tunc.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   I agree with the majority's statement of the facts and, if this were a case in which the circumstances and time constraints were not critical factors,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   I would agree with\n   its reasoning and result. Obviously, no court system can function if its docket is subject to the\n   <em>\n    unreasonable\n   </em>\n   whims or desires of litigants. Of course, courts must control their dockets and proceedings but not so rigidly as to deny due process to litigants, and it is unquestionably true that a major reason for the problem in the present case is the fact that the petitions were filed just five weeks before Henrry turned eighteen. I believe that this case falls into that rare category of emergency cases in which a court has a duty to act expeditiously to prevent an injustice and to ensure that the intent of the law is followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The relevant statute, \u00a7 45a-608n (b), provides: \"At any time during the pendency of a petition to remove a parent or other person as guardian under section 45a-609 or 45a-610, or to\n   <em>\n    appoint a guardian or coguardian\n   </em>\n   under 45a-616, a party may file a petition requesting the Probate Court to make findings under this section to be used in connection with a petition to the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services for designation of the minor child as having special immigrant juvenile status under [\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201101\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (27) (J) (2012) ].\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Probate Court shall cause\n   notice of the\n   hearing on the petition to be given by first class mail to each person listed in subsection (b) of section 45a-609, and\n   <em>\n    such hearing may be held at the same time as the hearing on the underlying petition for removal or appointment.

R. appointed as a coguardian of Henrry. The petitioner represented that Santos O. R. was her partner, that he lived with her and Henrry and that he was providing support for Henrry. General Statutes \u00a7 45a-616 (b) provides in relevant part: \"If any minor has a parent ... who is the sole guardian of the person of the child, the court of probate ... may, on the application of the parent ... appoint one or more persons to serve as coguardians of the child....\" Had the court appointed Santos O. R. as coguardian, it could have made the requisite findings necessary for the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services as required by \u00a7 45a-608n (b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The Probate Court also erred, in my opinion, when it denied the petitioner and Henrry an expedited hearing on the petition for removal of guardianship/appointment of coguardian for Henrry, and on the request for special immigrant juvenile status findings, despite clear requests by the petitioner to be heard before Henrry's eighteenth birthday. Such a hearing was required to facilitate the commands of \u00a7 45a-608n (b). Under the Probate Court rules, the court could have expedited the hearing. Section 8.7 of the Probate Court Rules provides: \"(a) A party may waive the party's right to notice of hearing by filing a written waiver of notice.\" By granting a waiver of notice of a hearing, the Probate Court could have, and should have, held an expedited hearing on the petitions. Instead, it processed the case as it would have any other petition coming before it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The Probate Court abused its discretion as well and erred when it denied the petitioner's motion for waiver of study by the Department of Children and Families (department), without holding a hearing, when it was\n   abundantly clear that the completion of the study would occur only after Henrry had turned eighteen. General Statutes \u00a7 45a-619 directs the court of probate, in any proceeding under \u00a7\u00a7 45a-603 to 45a-624 in which the applicant has alleged that the child has been abused or neglected, to request that the Commissioner of the Department of Children and Families (commissioner) investigate and provide a written report to it within ninety days. However, \"[i]n any other proceeding under sections 45a-603 to 45a-624, inclusive, the court shall request an investigation and report unless this requirement is waived for cause shown.\" General Statutes \u00a7 45a-619. The present case falls in the category of \"any other proceeding.\" The petitioner filed a motion for waiver of the department report in which she gave a detailed outline of why the report should be waived. The Probate Court denied the motion for waiver without explanation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The timing of a Probate Court hearing and a ruling on the petitions was critically important to protect Henrry's rights under \u00a7 45a-608n (b). He and his sister had fled Honduras on foot after his father and his grandfather were murdered, and they made the dangerous trip to this county to rejoin his mother. Henrry himself was fleeing the possibility of murder. He and his sister arrived in the United States approximately eight months before the petitions were filed. He was residing with the petitioner and Santos O. R. who were\n   supporting him. Because he was older than twelve years of age, Henrry was able to consent to the appointment of his coguardian and had done so. See General Statutes \u00a7 45a-616a (a) (3) (A). A medical examination cleared him to enroll as a student at high school. Was it conceivable that a department report could reveal information indicating that placing Henrry with the petitioner and Santos O. R. was problematical? Yes. Was a report truly necessary given the delay it would cause? Not remotely.\n   In a case when the eighteenth birthday of a minor child is not imminent, such a report is necessary to ensure that a child is kept in a safe and nurturing environment, particularly if a child is being placed with persons outside his or her family. But, in the present case, when the effect of ordering a report unquestionably undermined the time limitations of the statute, ordering it was an abuse of discretion. In the alternative, the Probate Court could have ordered the report from the commissioner but held the necessary hearing and made the requisite findings, reserving the right to reverse its decision if the commissioner's report did not support the petitions filed by the petitioner.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   I also conclude that the Superior Court erred in dismissing the appeals at issue for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. \"[A] determination regarding a trial court's subject matter jurisdiction is a question of law, [and therefore] our review is plenary....

In the present case, the petitioner was denied the right of a parent concerning the care, custody, and control of Henrry to protect him from potential deportation to Honduras, where he had received death threats, by having the Probate Court make the findings needed in connection with a petition to the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The Probate Court's failure to hold an expedited hearing to make the factual findings needed for the federal petition also were in violation of our state constitution. Article first, \u00a7 8, of the constitution of Connecticut provides in relevant part: \"No person shall ... be deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of law ....\" Article first, \u00a7 10, of the constitution of Connecticut provides that \"[a]ll courts shall be open, and every person, for an injury done to him in his person, property or reputation, shall have remedy by due course of law, and right and justice administered without sale, denial or delay.\" In this instance, by failing to hold an expedited hearing and make the findings required by \u00a7 45a-608n (b), the petitioner and Henrry were denied the benefit afforded them by the statute. Their interest in the benefit afforded by the statute is, at the very least, a property interest. See\n   <em>\n    Giaimo v.
