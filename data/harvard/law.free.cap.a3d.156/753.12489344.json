One rule is critical to the determination of appellate jurisdiction. The other sets the standard for imposing monetary sanctions when a litigant prosecutes a case in bad faith or without substantial justification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Petitioner Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission (\"the Commission\") contracted with Respondent Fort Myer Construction Corporation (\"Fort Myer\") to build a pedestrian bridge in accordance with design documents provided by the Commission. After running into several issues that delayed construction of the bridge, Fort Myer sued the Commission claiming that the design documents were at fault. The Commission impleaded Petitioner URS Corporation (\"URS\"), the engineering firm that created the design documents, on the theory that URS was contractually obligated to defend the Commission against Fort Myer's claims and would be liable for any damages. URS, in turn, countersued the Commission for contract payments that the Commission had withheld from URS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Fort Myer's original complaint was eventually dismissed by the Circuit Court without prejudice, but the claims between the Commission and URS went to trial. URS and the Commission each prevailed on their claims against each other. Both the Commission and URS asked the court to award monetary sanctions against their common adversary-Fort Myer-under Maryland Rule 1-341 on the basis that the construction company had litigated its original complaint \"without substantial justification.\" The Circuit Court did so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   All three parties appealed those rulings. The timing of the appeals of URS and the Commission, and its effect on appellate jurisdiction, became the dispositive issue for those appeals. The Court of Special\n   Appeals initially dismissed the appeals by URS and the Commission for being\n   <em>\n    too late\n   </em>\n   and then, after reconsidering the matter, decided that their appeals were, in fact,\n   <em>\n    too early\n   </em>\n   . On the other hand, the intermediate appellate court determined that Fort Myer's appeal of the sanctions awards was\n   <em>\n    just right\n   </em>\n   -both temporally and substantively-and reversed the Circuit Court's sanctions awards.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   URS and the Commission ask us to reverse the decision of the Court of Special Appeals on the sanctions awards, proposing both procedural and substantive grounds for doing so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The procedural issue turns on the requirement of Maryland Rule 2-601 that a final judgment-ordinarily necessary to trigger appellate jurisdiction-be incorporated in a \"separate document.\" In its revised opinion, the intermediate appellate court explained that the appeals by URS and the Commission were\n   <em>\n    too early\n   </em>\n   because the Circuit Court had not incorporated its judgment in favor of the Commission against URS in a separate document. Adopting that reasoning, URS and the Commission argue that Fort Myer's appeal of the sanctions awards was no more ripe for decision than their own appeals and, accordingly, the Court of Special Appeals should not have decided it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The substantive issue turns on the merits of the Circuit Court's conclusion that Fort Myer had prosecuted its complaint\n   \"without substantial justification.\" The Court of Special Appeals found that conclusion to be unsupported by the factors cited by the Circuit Court and therefore clearly erroneous-which rendered the Circuit Court's award of sanctions an abuse of discretion. URS and the Commission argue that, even if there was appellate jurisdiction of Fort Myer's appeal, the Court of Special Appeals should be reversed because the Circuit Court acted within its discretion in awarding sanctions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   We hold that the Court of Special Appeals properly exercised jurisdiction to decide the appeal of Fort Myer (and in fact had jurisdiction to decide those of URS and the Commission). Because the separate document requirement is intended to clarify the deadline for filing an appeal-not to create delay for its own sake-the separate document requirement may be waived when waiver does not prejudice appeal rights. Such is the case in this appeal. As for the sanctions awards against Fort Myer, we agree with the Court of Special Appeals that the Circuit Court's explanation of its reasoning did not support a finding that Fort Myer's pursuit of its claim was \"without substantial justification.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     A. Proceedings in the Circuit Court\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    A Bridge Contract Beset by Delays\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In 2008, Fort Myer contracted with the Commission to build a pedestrian bridge over Veirs Mill Road in Montgomery County. The contract required Fort Myer to construct the bridge according to design documents that had been prepared for the Commission by URS under a separate, earlier contract between the Commission and URS. Several problems arose during construction, and completion of the bridge was delayed by more than four months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    Fort Myer Sues the Commission\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Alleging that the construction issues and delay resulted from problems with the design documents, Fort Myer sued\n   the Commission on October 12, 2012, in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County. In Count I of the complaint, Fort Myer asserted breach of contract and sought $876,822.03 in damages related to Fort Myer's increased costs and lost profits. In Count II,\n   Fort Myer asked for a declaratory judgment requiring the Commission to pay Fort Myer $315,000 in contractual payments that the Commission was withholding as liquidated damages for the delays.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    The Commission Impleads URS; URS Counterclaims\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Some months later, on March 27, 2013, the Commission filed a third-party complaint against URS pursuant to Maryland Rule 2-332, seeking indemnification and contribution for any amount for which the Commission might be found liable to Fort Myer. The Commission also alleged that, under the design contract, URS had a duty to defend the Commission against Fort Myer's claims, and that URS had refused to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   URS answered the third-party complaint, asserting various defenses to the claims of both the Commission and Fort Myer.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   URS also asserted a counterclaim against the Commission, alleging that the Commission owed URS $103,420, which was due for services URS had provided to the Commission, but which the Commission had withheld in light of the impending claim by Fort Myer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Thereafter, the parties engaged in pretrial discovery. Various discovery disputes arose, which resulted in requests for sanctions. The Circuit Court referred some of those disputes to a special master, and ultimately adopted the recommendations of the master, which did not include sanctions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    Dismissal of Fort Myer's Complaint without Prejudice\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On February 26, 2014, after more than a year of litigation, URS moved to dismiss Fort Myer's complaint, or, in the alternative, for summary judgment. URS argued that Fort\n   Myer's complaint was deficient under a State statute because Fort Myer had not filed a certificate of a qualified expert (\"CQE\") in conjunction with its complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Maryland Code, Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (\"CJ\"), \u00a7 3-2C-01\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   That statute requires a plaintiff to file a CQE within 90 days of filing a malpractice claim against a licensed professional engineer.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   If a plaintiff fails to file a timely CQE, the statute provides for dismissal of the complaint without prejudice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   CJ \u00a7 3-2C-02(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Fort Myer initially opposed the URS motion. In its response, it noted that, given the statutory definition of \"claim,\" the CQE requirement applies only when a claim is \"filed ...\n   <em>\n    against\n   </em>\n   a licensed professional [engineer] or the employer, partnership, or other entity through which the licensed professional [engineer] performed professional services ... [and] based on the licensed professional's alleged negligent act or omission in rendering professional services....\" CJ \u00a7 3-2C-01(b) (emphasis added). Fort Myer argued that this requirement did not pertain to its complaint because its claims were asserted against the Commission, and not URS (which presumably employed the licensed professional engineers who created the design documents at issue).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In the meantime, URS and the Commission filed several summary judgment motions, seeking to dispose of the case on various legal grounds.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   On March 11, 2014, a few days after the summary judgment motions were filed and shortly before the scheduled trial, Fort Myer withdrew its opposition to URS's motion to dismiss, implicitly agreed that the CQE requirement applied to its complaint, and consented to dismissal of its complaint without prejudice. In a subsequent filing and at two pretrial hearings, counsel for Fort Myer explicitly agreed that the CQE statute applied and stated that the court was required to dismiss its complaint without prejudice. Unsurprisingly, URS and the Commission agreed that the complaint should be dismissed, but argued that the dismissal should be\n   <em>\n    with prejudice\n   </em>\n   . (The Commission took the position that the CQE statute did\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   apply to Fort Myer's claim, but that its complaint should be dismissed with prejudice for other reasons set out in its summary judgment motion).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   At a motions hearing on March 31, 2014, the Circuit Court decided to dismiss Fort Myer's complaint without prejudice. The third-party claim of the Commission against URS and URS's counterclaim against the Commission survived the dismissal of Fort Myer's complaint and remained pending, however.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    Sanctions Awards against Fort Myer\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   URS and the Commission pursued an award of sanctions against Fort Myer with respect to the ill-fated complaint that had been dismissed without prejudice. Their respective motions were brought under Maryland Rule 1-341(a), which authorizes a court to require a party or the party's attorney to pay the costs of a proceeding and reasonable expenses, including attorney's fees, incurred by an adverse party when the\n   court finds that a party acted \"in bad faith or without substantial justification\" in maintaining or defending a proceeding.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In its motion, the Commission alleged, among other things, that Fort Myer had failed to retain expert witnesses despite representing that it had done so; that Fort Myer's witnesses failed to appear for properly-noticed depositions; and that Fort Myer proceeded with depositions of Commission witnesses despite \"full knowledge that its complaint was fatally flawed\" because of the failure to file a CQE. The Commission sought recovery of the costs and attorney's fees incurred in defending against Fort Myer's complaint, which it computed to be $376,597.68. URS joined in the Commission's motion and sought recovery of its attorney's fees and costs incurred in the amount of $248,638.31. Fort Myer opposed the motions, arguing that its claims were made neither in bad faith nor without substantial justification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The Circuit Court held a hearing on the motions for sanctions on April 28, 2014. Ruling from the bench at the hearing, the\n   Circuit Court granted the motions of the Commission and URS. The court stated that its decision was not based on Fort Myer's failure to file a CQE, but rather on the \"the posture of the entire case.\" The court then expressed its frustration with what it referred to as \"blatant violations of the discovery rules\" that had caused it to take the unique step, in its experience, of referring the discovery disputes to a special master.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In explaining its reasoning, the court stated that it was \"not a question of whether [Fort Myer] had a right to pursue [its] case,\" but rather whether it had \"a legal obligation to do it without fatal flaws.\" The court reiterated that it believed that the failure to file a CQE by itself would not merit sanctions, but that the failure to do so, when coupled with the discovery violations, the dismissal of the complaint on the eve of trial, and Fort Myer's subsequent motion seeking sanctions against\n   the Commission, had led the court to conclude that a sanctions award against Fort Myer was appropriate. The court summarized that \"there has been a [Rule] 1-341 violation taking place in its entirety, discovery violations, conduct of counsel, lacking substantial justification.\" While the court stated that there was \"lack of substantial justification,\" it conceded that Fort Myer's underlying claim \"may be a cause of action in some other court, some other day, for some other judge to decide.\" The court explicitly declined to find that Fort Myer had acted in bad faith.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   At the hearing the court awarded $376,597.68 to the Commission and $248,638.31 to URS-the total amounts requested by each. The court incorporated its oral ruling in a written order dated May 29, 2014, which included a finding that the \"conduct of Fort Myer in maintaining [its] case was without substantial justification.\" The court clerk entered two separate written documents, each entitled Notice of Judgment, on June 2, 2014-one memorializing the award in favor of URS and the other the award in favor of the Commission.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <em>\n    Trial of Claims Between the Commission and URS\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In the meantime, the Commission and URS had continued to litigate their claims against one another. The Circuit Court held a bench trial on those claims on April 7 and 8, 2014. In an Order and Opinion issued on May 5, 2014, the Circuit Court decided in URS's favor on its counterclaim against the Commission and found that the Commission owed URS $103,420 with respect to the contract payments that the Commission had withheld from URS. The clerk entered a separate document in the record entitled Notice of Judgment in that amount.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In the same opinion, the Circuit Court also decided in the Commission's favor on its third-party claim against URS concerning the URS's contractual duty to defend the Commission against Fort Myer's claims. The court did not compute the amount of damages at that time or enter a separate\n   document incorporating its judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Some months later, on December 18, 2014, the Circuit Court held a hearing on the amount of damages owed by URS to the Commission on the duty-to-defend claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   At that hearing, the Circuit Court\n   ruled from the bench that URS owed the Commission $352,355.68 on that claim. That judgment was entered on the court's docket that same day in the following words: \"Court enters judgment in favor of the defendant Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission against the defendant URS Corporation-Maryland in the amount of three hundred fifty-two thousand, three hundred fifty-five dollars and sixty eight cents ($352,355.68).\" However, no separate written document reflecting the judgment on this claim was filed in the record at that or any later time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <em>\n    Motion for Reconsideration of Sanctions Awards\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   On November 10, 2014,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Fort Myer asked the Circuit Court to reconsider the awards of sanctions, arguing that its alleged bad acts during the litigation were not relevant to the question of whether its claim was filed or maintained \"without substantial justification.\" Opposing this motion, the Commission and URS again pointed to the alleged discovery violations and the lack of expert witnesses and a CQE.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The Circuit Court took up the motion at the hearing on December 18, 2014-the same hearing at which it determined the damages on the Commission's third-party claim against\n   URS. In a subsequent order entered February 19, 2015, the court denied the motion for reconsideration, noting that \"[n]o new facts or legal argument [were] presented in the motion\" and \"[n]o good reason [wa]s presented\" to reconsider the previous decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     B. Proceedings in the Court of Special Appeals\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <em>\n    Appeals Noted\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   In March 2015, each party filed a notice of appeal. In their respective notices of appeal, Fort Myer indicated that it was challenging the award of sanctions and URS stated that it was challenging the Circuit Court's ruling that it owed the Commission a duty to defend.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Commission also filed a notice of appeal but ultimately did not pursue its appeal-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , it did not file an appellant's brief, although it did file appellee briefs in response to briefs filed by Fort Myer and URS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The appeals were consolidated in the Court of Special Appeals. Although no party had addressed the issue of timeliness of the appeals in their briefs, the issue was raised by the court at oral argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <em>\n    April 1 Opinion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   On April 1, 2016, in an unreported opinion (\"April 1 opinion\"), the Court of Special\n   Appeals dismissed URS's appeal as\n   untimely. (The Commission's appeal was also dismissed as untimely, although the court acknowledged that the Commission had not pursued its appeal). However, the intermediate appellate court regarded Fort Myer's appeal as timely and reached the merits of that appeal, reversing the sanctions awards.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   In the April 1 opinion, the court concluded that URS's appeal was late because its notice of appeal was filed in March 2015, which was more than 30 days after December 18, 2014-the date that the Circuit Court had ruled from the bench and assessed $352,355.68 in damages in favor of the Commission, a ruling reflected on the docket that same day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   With respect to Fort Myer's appeal of the sanctions awards, the Court of Special Appeals held that the basis of the Circuit Court's ruling-that Fort Myer had conducted the litigation without substantial justification-was clearly erroneous. The court observed that the Circuit Court's decision turned largely on Fort Myer's failure to file a CQE and Fort Myer's subsequent decision, shortly before trial, to agree to dismissal of its complaint for that reason. The intermediate appellate court stated that the question whether Fort Myer was required to file a CQE was \"fairly debatable\" under the case law, as evidenced by the fact that URS had raised the issue relatively late in the proceedings and that the Commission itself had initially taken the position that a CQE was not required.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The Court of Special Appeals found the Circuit Court's other \"sweeping and nonspecific observations\" insufficient to support a finding that Fort Myer had prosecuted its claim without substantial justification. While the Circuit Court had expressed its frustration with the discovery disputes, it had not identified specific violations. Moreover, the Court of Special Appeals observed, the discovery rules provide their own sanctions for such violations, but the Circuit Court had accepted the special master's recommendations and declined to impose any such sanctions. Finally, the intermediate appellate court also opined that, if the Circuit Court believed that Fort Myer's own motion for sanctions against the Commission was\n   itself without substantial justification, the sanctions award in favor of the Commission should have been limited to the expenses incurred in defending that motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   In light of its conclusion that the Circuit Court had been clearly erroneous in finding that Fort Myer acted without substantial justification, the Court of Special Appeals held that the trial court had abused its discretion in awarding sanctions under Rule 1-341(a). For the same reasons, it also held that the Circuit Court abused its discretion when it denied Fort Myer's motion to reconsider the sanctions awards.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <em>\n    Motion for Reconsideration\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Ten days after the April 1 opinion was issued, URS filed a motion asking the Court of Special Appeals to reconsider its dismissal of URS's appeal. URS pointed out that, although the Circuit Court had announced its computation of the damages owed by URS to the Commission from the bench on December 18, 2014, that judgment had never been reduced to written form in a separate document as required by Maryland Rule 2-601(a). Because the deadline for filing an appeal is computed from entry of final judgment and because the separate document is ordinarily part of the entry of a final judgment, URS argued, its appeal was not late, because the \"clock\" that sets the deadline for filing an appeal had never actually begun to run. To rectify the situation, URS asked the Court of Special Appeals to rescind its dismissal and retain jurisdiction of its appeal. It also\n   suggested that the court could regard the separate document requirement as waived.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <em>\n    April 28 Opinion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   In response to the motion for reconsideration, the Court of Special Appeals withdrew its April 1 opinion and issued a partially revised unreported opinion on April 28, 2016 (\"April 28 opinion\"). In the April 28 opinion, the court agreed with URS that the absence of a separate document memorializing the December 18, 2014 judgment meant that final judgment had not yet been entered in accordance with Rule 2-601. It then dismissed the appeals by URS and the Commission \"as\n   not permitted by law.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court of Special Appeals did not address URS's argument that it could retain jurisdiction because the separate document requirement had been waived. The April 28 opinion retained in full the portion of the April 1 opinion overturning the Rule 1-341 sanctions against Fort Myer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     C. Petitions for Certiorari to Court of Appeals\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   URS and the Commission each petitioned this Court for a writ of\n   <em>\n    certiorari\n   </em>\n   , which we granted. URS and the Commission challenge the intermediate appellate court's reversal of the sanctions awards against Fort Myer on two bases: (1) that the Court of Special Appeals lacked any jurisdiction to consider Fort Myer's appeal because there was not a final judgment-essentially tracking the reasoning of the intermediate appellate court when it dismissed their own appeals-and (2) that, even if there was a final judgment, the Court of Special Appeals erred in reversing the awards of sanctions against Fort Myer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <strong>\n    II\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   For reasons outlined below, we agree with URS and the Commission that, in this case, the question whether there was an appealable final judgment for Fort Myer merits the same answer as whether there was an appealable final judgment for URS and the Commission. In our view, the answer is that there was appellate jurisdiction over all of these appeals. The only element lacking for purposes of entry of final judgment under Rule 2-601 was a separate document incorporating the Circuit Court's judgment in favor of the Commission against URS. In light of the absence of any objection, the Court of\n   Special Appeals should have regarded the separate document requirement of Rule 2-601(a) as waived.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   As to the second issue, we agree with the Court of Special Appeals that the Circuit Court's finding that Fort Myer maintained its action without substantial justification was clearly erroneous, and, correspondingly, that the Circuit Court abused its discretion when it awarded sanctions and denied the Fort Myer's motion to reconsider those sanctions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     A. Whether There Was Appellate Jurisdiction\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   URS and the Commission first contend that the decision of the Court of Special Appeals-expressed in both the April 1 opinion and the April 28 opinion-to overturn the sanctions awards against Fort Myer must be reversed because the intermediate appellate court lacked appellate jurisdiction over Fort Myer's appeal. Appellate jurisdiction was lacking, they argue, because the Circuit Court failed to enter a final judgment in accordance with\n   the Maryland Rules even though it had adjudicated all of the claims in the case. This is the same rationale that the Court of Special Appeals gave in its April 28 opinion for dismissing the appeals of URS and the Commission as premature. Essentially, URS and the Commission argue that the Fort Myer appeal should have been dismissed for the same reason as their appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   We agree that the various appeals in this case should be treated the same for purposes of appellate jurisdiction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   But we reach a different outcome than the Court of Special Appeals. We conclude that the separate document required under Rule 2-601(a) was the only element lacking for an appealable final judgment with respect to any of these appeals, that this requirement was waived, and that the Court of\n   Special Appeals properly had jurisdiction over Fort Myer's appeal.

None of the parties objected to the absence of a separate document reflecting that judgment in either the Circuit Court or the Court of Special Appeals.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   This case thus falls squarely into the framework identified in\n   <em>\n    Suburban Hospital.\n   </em>\n   We hold that the separate document requirement was waived and that the Court of Special Appeals had jurisdiction to consider the appeals of the Circuit Court's judgment. No party objected to the absence of a separate document in the Circuit Court or in the Court of Special Appeals. When URS asked that court to reconsider its initial dismissal of its appeal, URS specifically argued that the requirement was waived and no party contradicted that assertion. Unlike the situation in\n   <em>\n    Taha\n   </em>\n   , there is a written opinion explaining the court's decision on the third-party claim and the clerk entered judgment against URS on the docket, including the specific amount of damages.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Baltimore County v.

This would be a classic example of wheels spinning for no practical purpose. We hold that the separate document requirement has been waived, and that the Court of Special Appeals had appellate jurisdiction to decide Fort Myer's appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The determination as to whether appellate jurisdiction exists is not always easy. In this case, the litigants have been told, in succession: you're too late; you're too early; and maybe you're early, but it's okay. It may be the product of the intersection of a statutory limitation on appellate jurisdiction, rules designed both to implement the statutory limitation and to eliminate land mines on the way to appellate review, and an appellate court that is scrupulous about acting only when it properly has jurisdiction. Some confusion is perhaps inevitable. This bottom line in this case is that the Court of Special Appeals had appellate jurisdiction to decide the substantive issue that it decided.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     B.

The Court of Special Appeals overturned this finding as clearly erroneous. In light of that conclusion, the intermediate appellate court further held that it was an abuse of discretion for the Circuit Court to award sanctions under the rule and that it was also an abuse of discretion to deny the motion to reconsider the sanctions awards.

Under the case\n   law construing Rule 1-341, a claim or litigation position is \"without substantial justification\" if it is not fairly debatable,\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   not colorable,\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   or not within the realm of legitimate advocacy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   That standard is not met if a party has a \"reasonable basis for believing that [its] claims [will] generate an issue of fact for the fact finder.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nor is it met when a party advances an arguable interpretation of an ambiguous statute, even if ultimately rejected by a court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   <em>\n    Application to this Case\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   In concluding that Fort Myer had prosecuted its action without substantial justification, the Circuit Court recited a host of factors, somewhat vaguely, as the basis for its decision.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   We agree with the Court of Special Appeals that the factors cited by the Circuit Court do not support a finding that Fort Myer acted without substantial justification and that the Circuit Court's finding on that score was clearly erroneous. Given that the requisite finding was clearly erroneous, the Circuit Court abused its discretion when it awarded costs and attorney's fees to the Commission and URS and when it denied Fort Myer's motion to reconsider those awards.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   As the Court of Special Appeals explained-and as the Circuit Court appeared to acknowledge at the April 28, 2014, hearing-the legal issue \"at the heart of the sanctions motion\" was \"fairly debatable.\" In its complaint, Fort Myer attributed the delays in construction of the bridge to various factors beyond its control, most notably deficiencies in the design documents provided to it by the Commission. URS and the\n   Commission both contended, in various ways, that Fort Myer had failed to support that claim with necessary expert opinions and that this failure revealed the absence of any merit to its claim. In the Commission's words, the case was \"nothing more than a shake-down seeking to extract a settlement on a claim that Fort Myer knew never had any merit.\" However, the Circuit Court explicitly rejected this assessment. It specifically noted during the April 28, 2014, hearing that Fort Myer had a right to pursue its contentions and that, despite the dismissal, Fort Myer's claim \"may be a cause of action in some other court, some other day, for some other judge to decide.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   The Circuit Court focused less on the substantive merits-or lack thereof-of Fort Myer's claim than on the formal statutory requirement that plaintiffs in certain cases must file a CQE, on Fort Myer's alleged failure to designate an expert witness,\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   and on the various discovery disputes\n   that had arisen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   As the Court of Special Appeals noted, it was a \"fairly debatable legal question\" whether or not Fort Myer was required to file a CQE with its complaint. Under the statute, the CQE requirement applies only to a claim filed against \"a licensed professional [engineer] or the employer, partnership, or other entity through which the licensed professional [engineer] performed professional services\" based on the professional engineer's alleged negligent acts or omissions. CJ \u00a7 3-2C-01. Fort Myer's complaint alleged breach of contract-not negligence-and was brought against the Commission, which is neither a \"licensed professional\" nor arguably an \"employer, partnership, or other entity through which [a] licensed professional [engineer] performed professional services.\" In the Circuit Court, the Commission itself argued that these distinctions\n   took the case outside the CQE statute. There was, at the very least, a colorable argument that a CQE was not required.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Heavenly Days Crematorium, LLC v. Harris, Smariga and Associates, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3720759\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/433/558/\">\n    433 Md. 558\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3720759\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/433/558/\">\n    72 A.3d 199\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013) (holding that CQE not required when complaint did not allege negligent acts or omissions by a licensed professional engineer, but dismissal might be required if it became evident that the alleged negligence related to a licensed engineer).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   In addition to the absence of a CQE, the Circuit Court also repeatedly alluded to \"discovery violations\" committed by Fort Myer. URS and the Commission had earlier sought sanctions against Fort Myer under the discovery rules, in particular, Maryland Rules 2-432(a) and 2-443. The Circuit Court had referred those disputes to the special master who did not include sanctions in his reports, which were approved by the Circuit Court. Indeed, the Circuit Court never found a specific discovery violation or imposed any sanctions under the discovery rules.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Finally, while the Circuit Court alluded to the motion for sanctions filed\n   <em>\n    by\n   </em>\n   Fort Myer\n   <em>\n    against\n   </em>\n   the Commission,\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   it never explicitly found that this motion was \"without substantial justification.\" As the Court of Special Appeals noted, even if the court's vague reference to that motion sufficed as a finding under Rule 1-341(a), the sanctions awards were calculated to compensate URS and the Commission for their defense of the litigation from its outset and not just Fort Myer's motion for sanctions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   In sum, there is no factual support for the Circuit Court's finding that Fort Myer \"maintain[ed its] case ... without substantial justification.\" To the contrary, the Circuit Court appeared to believe that the underlying breach of contract claim was colorable. Moreover, the applicability of the CQE\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   requirement was \"fairly debatable.\" In that context, the Circuit Court's apparent finding that Fort Myer was responsible for discovery violations did not support sanctions under Rule 1-341 -as opposed to sanctions under the discovery rules that the court had previously declined to impose. The finding that Fort Myer had pursued its claim without substantial justification was clearly erroneous, and the Circuit Court abused its discretion when it imposed monetary sanctions and when it denied Fort Myer's motion to reconsider that decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   <strong>\n    III\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   For the reasons stated above, we affirm the decision of the Court of Special Appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   We hold that the separate document requirement of Rule 2-601 was waived, that there was a final judgment supporting appellate jurisdiction, and that that the Court of Special Appeals properly entertained Fort Myer's appeal. With respect to the substantive issue that the Court of Special Appeals decided, we agree that the Circuit Court's finding that Fort Myer maintained this case \"without substantial justification\" was clearly erroneous. Accordingly, we also agree that the Circuit Court abused its discretion when it awarded sanctions under Rule 1-341 and when it denied Fort Myer's motion for reconsideration on that issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   <strong>\n    JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED.

Under Maryland Rule 8-602(e)(1)(C), an appellate court has discretion to enter a final judgment on its own initiative if a circuit court could have entered a final judgment under Maryland Rule 2-602(b). Rule 2-602(b) authorizes a circuit court to direct entry of a final judgment as to fewer than all claims and parties when it determines that \"there is no just reason for delay.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-129\">\n    The Court of Special Appeals did not mention Rule 8-602(e)(1)(C) or Rule 2-602(b) in its April 28 opinion.
