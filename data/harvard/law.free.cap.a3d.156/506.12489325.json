We agree with the defendant that the trial court improperly allowed the police officer to present certain testimony regarding the cell phone records and maps, but find such error was harmless. We disagree with the defendant's other claims and, accordingly, affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The record reveals the following facts, which the jury reasonably could have found. On June 22, 2012, the victim, Lieslotte Worysz, went grocery shopping at a Stop and Shop grocery store in Rocky Hill. After completing her shopping, she returned to her home in Wethersfield. While driving home, the victim noticed a motor vehicle driving behind her. The victim testified that the vehicle was a Chrysler 300 and that she was able to identify its make and model because she and her husband previously owned Chryslers and \"were into cars.\" The victim further stated that the vehicle was \"fairly new\" and a \"light color,\" explaining as follows: \"[It] follow[ed] me [at] a distance ... and I admired [it]. I figured gee, the grill, everything is beautiful. I like it.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Upon returning home, the victim used a remote to open the door to her attached garage and parked her vehicle inside. The victim noticed that the vehicle that\n   had been following her home was parked behind her in the driveway. As the victim was about to exit her vehicle, the defendant, who was the driver of the vehicle that had follower her, approached her in\n   the garage, held a black gun to her stomach and demanded money. The victim said to the defendant, \"why are you doing this to me? I didn't do nothing to you,\" and tried to exit her vehicle, but the defendant pushed her back down into the driver's seat and said, \"[Y]ou shut up. If you're going to scream. I'm going to hurt you. I'm going to shoot you.\" The defendant then took the victim's remote and closed the garage door with both of them inside. The defendant grabbed the victim's pocketbook and took the money that was inside. He also took the victim's diamond ring, wedding band, watch, and keys. Afterward, the defendant opened the garage, threw the victim's keys and remote on the driveway, and left the scene. The victim picked up the items that the defendant had discarded, went into her house, and called the police.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   When the police arrived, they took several photographs of the scene. The victim told police about the Chrysler 300 and provided a description of the driver, but she could not identify him in a photographic array. Detectives Christopher Morris and James Darby of the Wethersfield Police Department processed the scene and the victim's belongings for fingerprints and DNA analysis. They obtained several latent fingerprints from the driver's door of the victim's vehicle and swabbed the victim's vehicle, remote, and wallet for DNA analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Darby processed the driver's side of the victim's vehicle for fingerprints because the victim \"had reported that as she was exiting [her vehicle], she was robbed and made by the suspect to sit back down inside [her vehicle].\" Darby took six \"hinge lifters\" and marked the locations for each lift. Morris sent the lifts to the Hartford Police Department, which found no matches.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Morris then took the lifts to the state forensic laboratory. John Brunetti from the state forensic laboratory testified regarding his analysis of two latent partial prints obtained from the victim's vehicle. He concluded that they matched, respectively, the defendant's left middle and index fingers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Thereafter, Morris went to the grocery store where the victim had been shopping and obtained the security video from the parking lot. Upon reviewing the video, Morris noted a white vehicle following the victim out of the parking lot. Upon further review of the video, Morris and the other officers noted several characteristics about that vehicle, namely, a black scuff mark on the rear bumper, an E-ZPass or some other form of transponder device on the front windshield, and a third brake light in the center of the vehicle's trunk that did not appear to be functioning properly. The vehicle had a Connecticut license plate on the front bumper, but officers were unable to obtain the plate number from the security video. Morris later showed the video to employees of a Chrysler dealership, who confirmed that the vehicle in the video was a Chrysler 300.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On June 25, 2012, Morris shared information about the case with other police departments and the media in order to obtain investigative leads from members of the public. The report released by the media described the perpetrator of the crime as a black male between thirty and forty years old, approximately five feet ten inches to six feet tall, medium build and short black hair. The report also described the vehicle allegedly used in the robbery, including that it may have had an E-ZPass or other form of transponder device on the front windshield.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The New Britain Police Department provided Morris with information on three white Chrysler 300 vehicles that had some contact with the police, including one\n   that belonged to the defendant. On June 25, the same day that the media released\n   information about the robbery, Morris drove to the defendant's address in New Britain and photographed his white Chrysler 300. Morris noticed that the defendant's vehicle had a black scuff mark on its rear bumper, which was consistent with the mark on the vehicle in the surveillance video. Morris then ran the vehicle's plate number through the license plate reader database and discovered that the Newington police had photographed the defendant's front license plate on June 1, 2012. Morris also discovered that the defendant's father, Eugene Edwards, Sr., had an E-ZPass account and that the transponders can easily be transferred between vehicles.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On June 27, 2012, two days after the media released the report of the robbery, Morris asked Officer Ronald Floyd of the Wethersfield Police Department to conduct further surveillance on the defendant's vehicle. Floyd drove to the defendant's house in New Britain and took several photographs of the defendant's vehicle, which was parked approximately 200 yards from the house in a school parking lot. Floyd's photograph of the front of the defendant's vehicle showed that it no longer had a front license plate and that material from the front bumper where the license plate screws had been placed was protruding, which indicated that the plate had recently been removed. Floyd observed two vertical marks on the front windshield, just below the rearview mirror, which were consistent with leftover adhesive from an E-ZPass or other similar transponder device. In Floyd's photograph, there was a New York Giants bumper sticker on the rear bumper, which was not in the photograph of the defendant's vehicle taken two days earlier. In addition, the photograph taken by Floyd showed that white paint had been applied to the black scuff mark on the rear bumper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On June 28, 2012, officers drove to the defendant's home in New Britain to execute a search warrant. Inside the defendant's house, the officers found the front license plate to the defendant's Chrysler 300, which had been hidden underneath the seat cushion of a sofa. The officers also discovered a black handheld BB gun in a bedroom closet.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The defendant remained outside while the police searched his home. The defendant also volunteered information about his vehicle to Detective Michael Patkoske of the Wethersfield Police Department. The defendant said that the scratches on his rear bumper had been there since he had purchased the vehicle, that the New York Giants bumper sticker had been on his rear bumper since 2011, and that he never had an E-ZPass account. The defendant also told Patkoske that his front license plate was under the couch and that it had been knocked off the car as a result of a motor vehicle accident in New York in 2011. The officers did not, however, observe any damage to the front of the defendant's car or on the license plate found in the home. Police seized the defendant's vehicle as evidence, and after further inspection, they determined that the third brake light on the vehicle was functioning properly. The defendant's nephew, Justin Collins, testified that the defendant had told Collins to tell the police that the BB gun was his if the police asked.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On July 3, 2012, Patkoske called the defendant and asked him if he would be willing to speak with him about his vehicle and his whereabouts in June, 2012. Although they had not discussed the dates of the Wethersfield or Berlin robberies; see footnote 1 of this opinion; the defendant told Patkoske \"I wasn't even here ... when all that stuff was going on, whenever that happened.\" He said that he was in North Carolina from June 19 to June 22\n   for his aunt's funeral and that he was with his girlfriend, Caryn Prince, in Virginia from\n   June 1 to June 9, but he was not confident of the dates. The defendant gave Prince's cell phone number to Patkoske and told him to check with her on the dates of the Virginia trip. Patkoske then called Prince twice on that same day to confirm the defendant's whereabouts. In between those two telephone calls, the defendant called Prince and told her that the police \"were trying to frame him\" and that, if the police called her, she should say that \"he was with [her].\" Prince told Patkoske that she was with the defendant in Virginia in May not in June. Patkoske later learned that the defendant was in Connecticut on June 22, 2012, because he had obtained a receipt from a retail store showing that the defendant had transacted business in Connecticut on that date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On September 19, 2012, the defendant appeared at the Wethersfield police station and was placed under arrest. The defendant maintained that he was not the perpetrator of the robberies, and he told Morris that he had \"the wrong tall, thin black male,\" and that \"no one picked him out of a lineup ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Thereafter, the defendant was charged, inter alia, with home invasion in violation of \u00a7 53a-100aa(a)(2), robbery in the first degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-134(a)(2), larceny in the second degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-123(a)(3), and assault of an elderly person in the third degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-61a(a)(1). See footnote 1 of this opinion. After a five day trial, the jury convicted the defendant of these charges. The trial court thereafter rendered judgment in accordance with the jury's verdict and sentenced the defendant to four concurrent terms of incarceration: twenty years for home invasion, twenty years for robbery in the first degree, one year for assault of an elderly person in the third degree and\n   ten years for larceny in the second degree. This appeal followed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On appeal, the defendant claims that: (1) the trial court improperly denied his motion to suppress certain statements that he had made to police; (2) the trial court abused its discretion when it allowed Morris to present certain nonexpert testimony regarding cell phone records and maps; and (3) the evidence was insufficient to support his convictions. We address each of these claims in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The defendant claims that the trial court improperly denied his motion to suppress certain statements that he made to the police. Specifically, the defendant asserts that the trial court improperly denied his motion to suppress statements made to the police during the execution of the search warrant at his home on June 28, 2012, and after his arrest on September 19, 2012, because he was not advised of his rights under\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Arizona\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12046400\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/384/436/#p478\">\n    384 U.S. 436\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 478-79,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12046400\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/384/436/#p478\">\n    86 S.Ct. 1602\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12046400\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/384/436/#p478\">\n    16 L.Ed.2d 694\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1966). The state responds that the trial court properly denied the defendant's motion to suppress because the statements were not made during a custodial interrogation. We agree with the state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The following additional facts are relevant to this claim. Before trial, the defendant filed a motion to suppress, claiming that his statements to the police should not be admitted at trial because the police failed to advise him of his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights. After a hearing, the trial court found the following facts: \"As part of their investigation, the Wethersfield Police Department\n   obtained a search warrant for a white Chrysler 300\n   registered to the defendant at 39 Nye Street, New Britain, the residence of the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \"On June 28, 2012 ... Patkoske was in an unmarked police vehicle .... After waiting for a period of time, the white vehicle, believed to be the defendant's, was observed driving to the [defendant's] residence. Once the defendant's vehicle entered the driveway, the police vehicle's lights were activated. The operator, identified as [the defendant], was asked to exit the vehicle and be subjected to a [patdown] for weapons. The passenger in the vehicle ... Collins ... was also subjected to a weapons search.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \"There were no weapons found [during the patdown]. The defendant was advised of the search warrants and the intended locations of the search. Information was obtained that there were other people in the residence. Those individuals were asked to exit during the execution of the search warrant for the residence. A search of the residence and the [vehicle] was conducted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \"While the searches were being conducted ... Patkoske testified that he remained outside of the residence, near the vehicle. ... Patkoste testified that the defendant was outside the residence, walking around the driveway, while not under arrest, nor handcuffed. Patkoske testified that during this time, the defendant spoke to him. The nature of the conversations were: why the police were there, information concerning the vehicle, [the] scratches on the vehicle, [the New York Giants] bumper sticker, and that the vehicle never had an [E-ZPass transponder] on the windshield.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \"There was also a discussion about the front marker plate of the vehicle.... Patkoske testified that he inquired of the defendant about the front plate. The defendant stated that the plate was knocked off the vehicle in an accident in New York, and that it [had] been off the vehicle for about a year. The defendant\n   further stated that he was the only one who drives the vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \"[Patkoske] testified that he remained at the 39 Nye Road location for the duration of the approximately two hour search of the residence and vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \"On September 19, 2012 ... Morris of the Wethersfield Police Department contacted the defendant indicating that he could pick up his vehicle at the station. This was a ruse to get the defendant to come to the police [station] to be arrested. Upon the defendant's arrival, he was placed under arrest. While under arrest and proceeding through the booking process ... Morris indicated that he inquired of the defendant only biographical questions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \"During the processing of the [uniform arrest record] ... Morris testified that the defendant stated that he was not the same person that was arrested in New York fifteen years ago, that [that is] all they got on him, and no one picked him out of a lineup. At the time of these statements, the defendant was under arrest, but had not yet been read his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   advisements.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.) The trial court denied the defendant's motion to suppress in its entirety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \"Our standard of review of a trial court's findings and conclusions in connection with a motion to suppress is [well-defined]. A finding of fact will not be disturbed unless it is clearly erroneous in view of the evidence and pleadings in the whole record .... [W]here the legal conclusions of the court are challenged, we must determine whether they are legally and logically correct and whether they find support in the facts set out in the memorandum of decision ....\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12484923\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/138/223/#p288\">\n    321 Conn. 278\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 288,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12484923\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/138/223/#p288\">\n    138 A.3d 223\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016) ; see\n   also\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Betances\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"913251\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/265/493/#p500\">\n    265 Conn. 493\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 500,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=828%20A.2d%201248\">\n    828 A.2d 1248\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2003).\n   In order to establish that he was entitled to\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings, a defendant must show that he was in custody when he made the statements and that he made the statements in response to police questioning.\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Mangual\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=311%20Conn.%20182\">\n    311 Conn. 182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 192,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=85%20A.3d%20627\">\n    85 A.3d 627\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014).

The court has analyzed the credible testimony against the law, as it relates to custody previously indicated. After review, the court finds that the defendant was in custody at the time he is alleged to have made the statements sought to be suppressed. \"Therefore, the court finds custody existed for the purposes of a\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   advisement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \"[Morris] indicated that he did not advise the defendant pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   at that time.

We disagree. It is undisputed that Morris intended the ruse concerning the release of the defendant's vehicle to subject the defendant to custody in a location that was\n   deemed more safe than attempting to place the defendant in custody inside of his home; the plan was not designed to subject the defendant to an interrogation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Indeed, the evidence established that the defendant did not make any incriminating statements at the time he was being arrested or when he first discovered the ruse. Instead, the defendant made statements concerning his New York arrest and that no one picked him out of a lineup after Morris and other officers arrested him and escorted him to the booking area. Therefore, the ruse did not cause the defendant's statements. Furthermore, Morris testified that he never asked the defendant any questions that would have elicited those\n   statements. To the contrary, Morris informed the defendant that he would not be asking him any questions and gave him the opportunity to contact an attorney. On the basis of these facts, we conclude that the defendant was not subjected to an interrogation before making his statements to police on September 19, 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Because the defendant was not in custody during the search of his home on June 28, 2012, and was not subjected to an interrogation before making his statements to the police on September 19, 2012, we conclude that the trial court properly denied the defendant's motion to suppress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The defendant next claims that the trial court improperly admitted testimony from Morris regarding cell phone data and maps regarding cell tower coverage areas without determining that the evidence was based on reliable scientific principles under\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Porter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"72601\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/241/57/#p80\">\n    241 Conn. 57\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 80-90,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=698%20A.2d%20739\">\n    698 A.2d 739\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1997), cert. denied,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11526881,11527011,11527046,11526795,11526930,11526835,11527155,11526966,11527099\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/523/1058/\">\n    523 U.S. 1058\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=118%20S.%20Ct.%201384\">\n    118 S.Ct. 1384\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=140%20L.%20Ed.%202d%20645\">\n    140 L.Ed.2d 645\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1998). In response, the state does not assert that Morris did not provide expert testimony, but instead claims that a\n   <em>\n    Porter\n   </em>\n   hearing was not required because Morris did not provide expert testimony based on scientific evidence. Further, the state asserts that even if Morris' testimony was improperly admitted into evidence, it was harmless. We agree with the defendant that the trial court abused its discretion by allowing Morris to testify about cell phone data without qualifying him as an expert witness, but find that the error was harmless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The following additional facts are relevant to the resolution of this issue. Prior to trial, the defendant filed a motion in limine seeking to preclude the admission of cell phone data and requested a hearing pursuant to\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Porter\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"72601\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/241/57/#p80\">\n    241 Conn. at 57\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=698%20A.2d%20739\">\n    698 A.2d 739\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The trial court postponed ruling on the defendant's motion until trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Outside of the presence of the jury, the trial court allowed the state to make its offer of proof regarding the cell phone data. In its first offer of proof, the state presented Cherylene Paddock, an employee of Verizon, who was the custodian of records. After hearing her testimony, the trial court ruled that Paddock could not give an \"engineering or technical opinion\" based upon the records. On October 25, 2013, the trial court revisited whether Paddock was qualified to testify about issues such as call strength and whether cell calls connect to the cell tower closest to the cell phone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   After she was questioned further regarding her training at Verizon, the court ruled as follows: \"I ruled yesterday that ... Paddock is an expert as to records. She has indicated that by her testimony. She has indicated that she is the custodian of records. She is not an expert as to scientific or technological type issues. She's indicated that by the testimony she's given as well as her admissions, her statements. She has indicated and we all note it by her testimony that she cannot testify about, I guess for lack of a better term,\n   I'm using her term, engineer related questions including range from cell phone to a particular [cell] tower because her basis of knowledge on this topic was not experience or education but rather someone told her what to say. The ruling allowed initially that the records were admissible subject to some redaction.... Paddock testified briefly and then continued to today.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   \"The court continued to consider this issue about the relevancy of the cell tower location information without a correlation to where the cell phone would be approximately located with reference to the [cell] tower because the basis of my understanding and thought process if there were no range indications then a jury would not know if a cell phone caller was standing ten feet from the [cell] tower or ten miles away. So the court ... reviewed the testimony ... of ... Paddock,\n   and there was testimony concerning the location of the [cell] tower with reference to a cell phone [and] testimony [that the cell phone] would be picking up the closest [cell] tower. I wanted to clarify that so I listened to her testimony that was recorded and we brought her in this morning and I appreciate the state bringing her in for that purpose. The court inquired of her ... basis of knowledge to that fact being that the cell phone calls [are] picked up by the closest [cell] tower. She's indicated that that was on the record but basically that it came from her training to be a custodian of records. So the court is still faced with the relevancy argument not cleared up by the further testimony of ... Paddock.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   \"So reviewing the records that have been offered, cell phone information concerning ... phone calls made from an out-of-state location is within the records. I think it was questioned by [defense counsel] about roaming. So that is on the record and without a need for specified, or specific, or expert knowledge. So the records of cell phone calls between June [19 and 22], the court says are relevant and are allowed. Cell phone information from the records concerning in state, out-of-state issues between June 12 and 14, again are they made in state or are they made out of state. There again is no need for specified knowledge and that is allowed. However, the specified calls on June 1 and 22, and I'm speaking about later in the day on June 22, are offered for a specific cell ... tower location and an approximate location of where the user is involves a specific knowledge. Someone needs to come in with knowledge and a basis of knowledge other than someone told her.\" Thus, the court concluded as follows: \"My ruling is obviously, the records are custodian issues and the records under a business record, but specifically ... Paddock is precluded from testifying about cell ... tower locations on the date and time of the incident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Those are those dates that we talked about, those five dates.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The state then made a second offer of proof through Morris. Morris testified that, approximately five months before trial, he had attended a three day training in Massachusetts on \"advanced cell phone investigations\" and mapping of cell towers from phone call \"records that we receive from [cell phone] companies.\" Morris testified that he had worked with cell phone records \"[n]umerous, numerous times ... [w]ay more than ten.\" Morris explained that in the training he had learned how to use computer software entitled Microsoft Streets and Trips to analyze data from a cellular provider. Specifically, Morris testified that he could use the program to map cell towers that may have handled calls and to show the coverage area of those calls. He briefly described the terms \"azimuth\" and \"bismuth\" and explained that those terms defined the coverage area of the cell tower.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The state then asked Morris whether he had used \"this exercise\" on the cell phone records provided by Verizon for the defendant's cell phone. Morris responded that he had used the data provided by Verizon to create certain maps showing cell tower coverage. Morris further testified that his use of the data provided by Verizon enabled him to conclude that a cell tower located approximately 1200 feet from the grocery store where the victim had shopped had \"handled calls made from [the defendant's] cell phone at three different times\" while the victim was shopping there. Morris further testified that he had also completed a similar analysis for the victim's home address and had found that there were calls from the defendant's cell phone accessing a cell tower nearby. Morris further indicated that he could go \"through the same exercise\" for other locations and that his conclusions would be based on his \"training and experience.\" On cross-examination,\n   when asked how he determined an azimuth, bismuth and something called an \"optimal bismuth,\" Morris stated that they are provided by the records that he obtains from any given cell provider. Morris agreed that he had been instructed to use \"extreme caution when making any firm conclusion about coverage area\" and he acknowledged that network congestion, weather, maintenance issues, natural topology, thick foliage, and manmade structures can affect coverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The trial court then ruled that the state had met its burden of establishing the reliability of the proffered evidence and that Morris was qualified by his expertise to analyze cell phone data provided in Verizon records. The trial court ruled as follows: \"The court and counsel may recall that when I amended my ruling of yesterday this morning, the crux or the keystone of the ruling was that the specified calls on June 1 and 22 ... are offered for a specific cell tower location and approximate cell phone user location and involves a specific knowledge.

Although the [s]tate urges that a layperson with the same phone records and instructions could have determined the location of the cell sites (even aside from the fact that the jury never received the full records and that the step-by-step instructions were developed from another source), additional training and experience were required to parlay the process from which [the police officer] derived the communication path of each call.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4307929\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/440/680/#p700\">\n    Id., at 700-701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4307929\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/440/680/#p700\">\n    104 A.3d 142\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   Similarly, in the present case, although Morris relied on data he obtained from Verizon to conduct his analysis, the process he used to arrive at his conclusions was beyond the ken of average juror. Indeed, even the trial court acknowledged that Morris had an expertise that allowed him to be more knowledgeable on the subject of cell phone data than the average juror.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   The trial court explained that \"Morris has the education and training to competently testify [about cell] tower[s] and how [they connect] to cell phones....

The data, in the form of a list of cell towers and calls made by a cell phone that was registered to the defendant, was introduced as a full exhibit as a business record through Paddock, the custodian of records for Verizon. Although Morris was asked to review the data and stated that he recognized the data as that which he had received from Verizon in an electronic format, his testimony did not\n   come directly from the data provided by Verizon.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Instead, Morris' testimony explained various maps that he had created by inputting the data provided by Verizon into a computer program called Microsoft Streets and Trips.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Morris explained the process for making the maps as follows: \"I would import the data that comes through on a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet from Verizon ... into a software product that we use called Microsoft Streets and Trips. It's just a mapping software program that can ... take the latitude and longitude of the cell tower.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   \"Now, the latitude and longitude of the cell tower is ... provided to me by Verizon .... They give me a list of all the cell towers that they have in the state of Connecticut ... the tower number that they assign to that [cell] tower, and the latitude and longitude for that [cell] tower.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   \"And then ... I look at the list to see the call that I'm looking for, the one that I want to map onto it, so in this case the call at 10:49 a.m., I would look there to see which ... cell tower did it access and which cell face did it access and then I'd plot that on the map using what the azimuth is....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   \"So in this particular map here, the azimuth is 270 degrees, so I start out with a red line indicating ... the azimuth, and then they tell me that the ... optimal beam width is 65.5, so I'd split that in half on either side of the azimuth, so that gives me a pie shaped figure of what the strongest signal of the cell phone coverage would be. And then I would take, knowing that there's only three cell faces for this [cell] tower for Verizon, I would use 60 degrees on each side, which brings us again, to the 120 [degrees] for that particular cell face and make a bigger pie to show that that cell face can handle this entire area.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Morris further testified as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   \"[The Prosecutor]: And what does that pie ... tell us?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   \"[Morris]: It tells you that ... the call most likely came from that ... section in there....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   \"[The Prosecutor]: And ... what did you mean by that?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   \"[Morris]: The ... colored area that I shaded in between the outer lines of the ... total beam width and the exterior coverage for ... that [cell] tower, anything inside those borders is where the call most likely came from. And the way I determined the border for how far away that call would most likely have originated from is by looking at all the other [cell] towers on the map to see the halfway point between this [cell] tower and the next [cell] tower over there, the halfway point between the [cell] tower here and the next [cell]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   tower over there and just all the way in a circle and creating this-it's not always a perfect circle because [cell] towers are placed in different positions.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Morris then testified about cell phone calls made on the dates of the Berlin and Wethersfield incidents. See footnote 1 of this opinion. For each of these cell phone calls, he made maps using the process previously described. Specifically, Morris created a cell tower coverage map for calls associated with the defendant's cell phone on June 22, 2012, at 10:05 a.m., 10:10 a.m. and 10:13 a.m., the approximate time during which the victim was inside of the\n   grocery store. Then, in response to questioning from the state, Morris pointed to the location of the grocery store on the map that he had created, showing that it was within the coverage area of the cell tower accessed by the defendant's cell phone during those calls. Morris also testified that he had created a cell tower coverage map for calls associated with the defendant's cell phone on June 22, 2012, at 10:41 a.m. and 10:46 a.m., the approximate time of the attack at the victim's home. Then, in response to questioning from the state, Morris pointed to the location of the victim's home on the map he created, showing that the victim's home was within the coverage area of the cell tower accessed by the defendant's cell phone during those calls.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   The defendant asserts that the trial court abused its discretion by admitting testimonial and documentary evidence through Morris without determining that the evidence was based on reliable scientific methodology. This court has not previously had the opportunity to examine the criteria for determining the admissibility of cell phone data. The issue has, however, been addressed in federal court.

We note that, in the present case, the defendant makes no claim of constitutional error. For the following reasons, we conclude that the trial court's\n   improper admission of Morris' testimony regarding the cell phone data was harmless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   After reviewing the evidence in the present case, we cannot conclude that the admission of Morris' testimony and the cell tower coverage maps substantially affected the verdict in the present case. First and foremost, the defendant was charged with crimes relating to two separate incidents and Morris' testimony regarding cell phone data and cell tower coverage maps regarding both incidents was entered into evidence. Nevertheless, the jury acquitted the defendant on all charges related to the Berlin incident. See footnote 1 of this opinion. The fact that the jury was able to acquit the defendant on some charges is strong evidence that the improperly admitted evidence did not substantially affect the verdict. See\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Medrano\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=308%20Conn.%20604\">\n    308 Conn. 604\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 629,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=65%20A.3d%20503\">\n    65 A.3d 503\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013) (\"[t]he fact that the jury acquitted the defendant of murder and found him guilty of manslaughter in the first degree demonstrates that the jury believed the defendant's testimony, regardless of the court's [improper] instruction\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Second, even without Morris' testimony, the jury still could conclude from the cell phone records themselves that the defendant's cell phone accessed cell towers in Rocky Hill and Wethersfield on the date of the robbery, which coincides with the victim's testimony that she was followed from the grocery store in Rocky Hill and robbed at her home in Wethersfield.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Third, defense counsel rigorously cross-examined Morris on the accuracy of the cell phone data. As a result, Morris acknowledged that he could not guarantee that his maps accurately reflect \"the state of the network on June 22, 2012,\" that the\n   cell phone's connection with a specific cell tower does not necessarily mean that it is connecting with the cell tower closest in range and that he could not determine from the cell phone records the exact location of the defendant's cell phone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Fourth, when compared to the other evidence of guilt-namely, the fingerprint evidence, the victim's testimony, the surveillance video showing a vehicle of the same make and model as that owned by the defendant, the consciousness of guilt evidence, and the defendant's statements to police-we cannot conclude that Morris' testimony substantially affected the verdict. Indeed, as more fully discussed in part III A of this opinion, the state presented overwhelming evidence of the defendant's identity as the perpetrator of the crimes. Accordingly, we cannot conclude that the trial court's improper admission of Morris' testimony regarding the cell phone data and the cell tower coverage maps substantially affected the jury's verdict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Finally, the defendant claims that there was insufficient evidence to support his convictions. Specifically, the defendant asserts that there was insufficient evidence to support his convictions of home invasion, robbery in the first degree, larceny in the second degree, and assault of an elderly person in the third degree because the state failed to establish the element of identity. The defendant also asserts that there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction of home invasion because the state failed to establish that he was armed with a deadly weapon. The state responds that\n   there was sufficient evidence to support the defendant's convictions on all counts. We agree with the state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   In reviewing a sufficiency of the evidence claim, we apply a two part test. \"First, we construe the evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the verdict. Second, we determine whether upon the facts so construed and the inferences reasonably drawn therefrom the jury reasonably could have concluded that the cumulative force of the evidence established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   \"We note that the jury must find every element proven beyond a reasonable doubt in order to find the defendant guilty of the charged offense, [but] each of the basic and inferred facts underlying those conclusions need not be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.... If it is reasonable and logical for the jury to conclude that a basic fact or an inferred fact is true, the jury is permitted to consider the fact proven and may consider it in combination with other proven facts in determining whether the cumulative effect of all the evidence proves the defendant guilty of all the elements of the crime charged beyond a reasonable doubt.... Moreover, [w]here a group of facts are relied upon for proof of an element of the crime it is their cumulative impact that is to be weighed in deciding whether the standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt has been met and each individual fact need not be proved in accordance with that standard. It is only where a single fact is essential to proof of an element, however, such as identification by means of fingerprint evidence, that such evidence must support the inference of that fact beyond a reasonable doubt....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   \"As we have often noted, however, proof beyond a reasonable doubt does not mean proof beyond all possible doubt ... nor does proof beyond a reasonable doubt require acceptance of every hypothesis of\n   innocence posed by the defendant that, had it been found credible by the trier, would have resulted in an acquittal.... On appeal, we do not ask whether there is a reasonable view of the evidence that would support a reasonable\n   hypothesis of innocence. We ask, instead, whether there is a reasonable view of the evidence that supports the jury's verdict of guilty.... Furthermore, [i]t is immaterial to the probative force of the evidence that it consists, in whole or in part, of circumstantial rather than direct evidence.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Gonzalez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=311%20Conn.%20408\">\n    311 Conn. 408\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 419-20,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=87%20A.3d%201101\">\n    87 A.3d 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014) ; see also\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Otto\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=305%20Conn.%2051\">\n    305 Conn. 51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 65-66,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=43%20A.3d%20629\">\n    43 A.3d 629\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   The defendant asserts that there was insufficient evidence to support the jury's finding that the defendant was the perpetrator of the crimes for which he was convicted.

In the present case, the state introduced evidence to establish that the defendant made changes to his vehicle's appearance after the police released a statement to the media containing a description of the vehicle involved in the incident. Specifically, Morris and Floyd testified that the front license plate had been recently removed. Morris also testified that a New York Giants bumper sticker had been placed on the vehicle's rear bumper and that paint had been applied to the black scuff mark on the rear bumper\n   after the media released the report with a description of the vehicle. Furthermore, the state also introduced evidence to establish that the defendant volunteered statements to the police regarding the changes to his vehicle. Specifically,\n   while officers were executing the search warrant of his home, the defendant volunteered that the New York Giants bumper sticker had been on his vehicle's rear bumper since 2011, which is inconsistent with the photograph taken by Morris on June 25, 2012. During this time, the defendant also told police that his front license plate had been knocked off the vehicle as a result of a motor vehicle accident in 2011, which was inconsistent with photographs obtained from the state license plate reader database on June 1, 2012, in which his vehicle's front license plate was intact and there appeared to be no damage to the front end of his vehicle. The state also introduced evidence that the defendant attempted to distance himself from the crime. Specifically, the defendant instructed Collins to claim ownership of the BB gun if the police asked about it and instructed Prince to say that he was out of state with her on the day of the incident. It is well established that \"[i]n a criminal trial, it is relevant to show the conduct of an accused, as well as any statement made by him subsequent to the alleged criminal act, which may fairly be inferred to have been influenced by the criminal act....

Furthermore, it is undisputed that an operable BB gun is a deadly weapon.\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Grant\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5769874\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/294/151/#p157\">\n    294 Conn. 151\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 157-61,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=982%20A.2d%20169\">\n    982 A.2d 169\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   At trial, the victim testified that, during the robbery, the perpetrator held a \"black gun\" in his hand.
