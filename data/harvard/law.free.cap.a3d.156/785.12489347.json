Rodowsky (Senior Judge, Specially Assigned), JJ.\n </attorneys>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <author id=\"p-8\">\n   Getty, J.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In this case we are asked to determine whether a trial judge's\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   communication with a juror violated Maryland Rule 4-326(d)(2) and, if so, whether such violation was harmless. In addition, we must determine whether a suspect can invoke his right to counsel under\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   by demanding to see a lawyer while in a holding cell before interrogation begins.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   For the reasons that follow, we conclude that although the trial judge did violate Rule 4-326(d)(2), that error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. In addition, we hold that the Petitioner did not invoke his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   right to counsel by demanding to see a lawyer from his holding cell before being interrogated, and therefore the circuit court did not err in denying the Petitioner's motion to suppress the statements he made to detectives during his interrogation. Accordingly, we will affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     A. The Murder\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On Saturday, October 12, 2013, Petitioner Rahul Gupta and his girlfriend, Taylor\n   Gould, went out to dinner in the Dupont Circle neighborhood of Washington, D.C. to celebrate Mr. Gupta's twenty-fourth birthday. After dinner, the couple walked to a nearby bar, where they met up with two of Mr. Gupta's friends-Mark Waugh and Josh White. Approximately an hour later, the group moved to another nearby bar, at which point they split up into pairs. Mr. Gupta went outside with Mr. White, while Mr. Waugh remained inside the bar with Ms. Gould. Mr. Gupta testified that he went outside with\n   Mr. White to smoke marijuana. He also testified that, during this time, Mr. White told Mr. Gupta that he thought Ms. Gould was flirting with him. Meanwhile, inside the bar, Ms. Gould confided in Mr. Waugh that she felt like Mr. White was hitting on her, and it was making her uncomfortable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Later, after the group had moved to a third bar, Mr. Waugh confronted Mr. Gupta about the situation between Ms. Gould and Mr. White, telling Mr. Gupta that Mr. White was \"trying to make a move on\" Ms. Gould. Mr. White denied the accusation, and decided at that time to return to his apartment in the Woodley Park neighborhood of Washington, D.C. Mr. Gupta and Ms. Gould also decided to call it a night, and the couple took a taxi back to the apartment they shared in Silver Spring, Maryland, accompanied by Mr. Waugh.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Surveillance cameras in the Silver Spring apartment building show that the trio arrived at 1:50 a.m. on Sunday, October 13, 2013. Once inside the apartment, they took shots of vodka, Mr. Gupta smoked more marijuana, and all three sat on the couch and began playing video games. At some point, there was another discussion about whether there had been any flirting between Ms. Gould and Mr. White earlier in the night. Ms. Gould testified that Mr. Waugh helped her confront Mr. Gupta about the perceived flirting by Mr. White, while Mr. Gupta testified that Mr. Waugh did not believe Ms. Gould's accusation that Mr. White was \"hitting on her.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Both Mr. Gupta and Ms. Gould claimed that they could not clearly remember the events following this discussion, as both had been drinking heavily throughout the night. But at 3:25 a.m., Ms. Gould called 911 at Mr. Gupta's direction. She told the operator that \"my friend is ... here and I need emergency right now,\" that \"he's not breathing,\" and that \"there's blood everywhere.\" When the operator asked Ms. Gould what had happened, she relayed the question to Mr. Gupta, and then responded to the operator, \"I don't know what happened.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Police officers arrived at the apartment at 3:36 a.m., and encountered a \"very intoxicated\" Ms. Gould at the front door.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   She repeated to the officer that she did not know what happened, and they placed her in handcuffs and detained her outside the apartment. The officers who entered the apartment found Mr. Gupta groaning and covered in blood, lying on the floor just to the left of Mr. Waugh's body. When the officers asked Mr. Gupta what happened, he responded, \"They were cheating. My girlfriend was cheating on me. My buddy and my girlfriend were cheating. I walked in on my buddy and my girlfriend cheating. I killed my buddy.\" Medical technicians on the scene confirmed that Mr. Waugh was dead. The medical examiner testified that Mr. Waugh had six stab wounds and five \"cutting injuries.\" Police recovered an eight-inch kitchen knife, identified as the murder weapon, from under Mr. Waugh's leg.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     B. The Interrogation and Suppression Hearing\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Police officers transported Mr. Gupta and Ms. Gould, separately, to the Major Crimes Division of the Montgomery County\n   Police Department. Once there, they placed Mr. Gupta in a holding cell to await interrogation. In the holding cell, at 5:05 a.m., Mr. Gupta screamed at Officer Andrew Richardson, who was stationed nearby to keep an eye on Mr. Gupta, that he was \"going to sue the shit out of all of you.\" Mr. Gupta also pounded on the door of his cell, and screamed-two to three times-\"I want a lawyer.\" Approximately ten to thirty minutes later, according to Officer Richardson's estimate, Detectives Paula Hamill and Kathy Fumagalli arrived to speak with Mr. Gupta and Ms. Gould. Officer Richardson relayed to the detectives Mr. Gupta's request for a lawyer. At the suppression hearing, Detective Fumagalli testified that she remembered receiving this information, while Detective Hamill testified that she did not remember learning that Mr. Gupta had requested a lawyer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The detectives spoke to Ms. Gould first. Then, at 8:10 a.m., they moved Mr. Gupta from the holding cell into an interview room and began questioning him. After answering some preliminary questions about his background and current state of mind, Detective Hamill read Mr. Gupta his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights\n   and asked him whether he understood those rights. Mr. Gupta responded, \"Yes.\" After about eight seconds of silence, Mr. Gupta asked, \"When do I get to talk ...,\" before Detective Hamill interrupted him by stating, \"Okay, do you ... here's the deal. We're just trying to find out what the heck happened. You know what I mean?\" Mr. Gupta cooperated with the detectives and answered their questions throughout the fifty-five-minute interrogation, and did not request to see or speak to a lawyer until approximately one hour after the interrogation had ended. At trial, the State questioned Mr. Gupta on cross-examination regarding some of the statements he had made during the interrogation. The statements themselves were not admitted into evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The State charged Mr. Gupta with first- and second-degree murder in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County. Prior to trial, Mr. Gupta filed a motion to suppress the statements he made to police officers on the morning of his arrest. Specifically, and relevant to this appeal, Mr. Gupta argued that the statements he made while being interrogated by Detectives Hamill and Fumagalli should be suppressed because they were obtained in violation of his right to have counsel present during questioning under\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   . Mr. Gupta asserted that his demands to see a lawyer while he was in the holding cell awaiting interrogation were made \"in the context of custodial interrogation\" or when interrogation was \"imminent.\" Upon learning of these requests, the detectives were required to cease questioning until Mr. Gupta had a chance to speak with a lawyer. Therefore, Mr. Gupta concluded, any statements he made to the detectives during the interrogation must be suppressed as being obtained in violation of his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   right to counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Following a suppression hearing on July 30 and 31, 2014, the circuit court denied Mr. Gupta's motion to suppress. The court found that Mr. Gupta had requested a lawyer \"two to four times ... while in custody before interrogation took place,\" and that \"that communication was passed along to the detectives,\" or at least to Detective Fumagalli, by Officer Richardson. However, the court concluded that these demands\n   did not equate to an invocation of the right to counsel under\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   , because they were made prior to interrogation. Furthermore, the court found that Mr. Gupta was advised of his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights, \"that he made a knowing and intelligent waiver\" of those rights, and that he \"did not assert at all, let alone without equivocation, a desire to have counsel present.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     C. The Trial\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Mr. Gupta's trial began on Monday, March 2, 2015. During jury selection, the court advised the potential jurors that the trial was scheduled to \"take eight days to try to completion,\" meaning it would likely last until Wednesday of the following week, March 11. The court asked if anyone would be unable to serve during that time due to a substantial personal or financial hardship. Prospective Juror 18A, along with many others, responded in the affirmative. When questioned individually about her response, Juror 18A explained that she works \"for a very small non-profit, so [her] absence for an extended period of time will be difficult.\" Additionally, she stated that she had \"two children at home and no child care,\" so she would \"be in a position to try to find somebody to look after\" them during the trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   These answers, along with the fact that Juror 18A stated that she was social friends with defense counsel's partner, caused the court concern. The court then asked if there would be any objection to striking this juror, to which the State responded, \"No.\" Defense counsel did object, however, and stated that \"she's a good juror.\" Juror 18A remained on the jury panel, and ultimately became a member of Mr. Gupta's jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On Thursday, March 5, the circuit court was closed due to snow. At the close of proceedings on Friday, March 6, the court told the jury that the trial was taking longer than originally expected. Thus, the court told the jurors to prepare to serve until the following Friday, March 13, and, \"out of an abundance of caution, some days after that.\" The court instructed the jurors to make the court aware when they\n   returned the following Monday if they foresaw any potential conflicts with serving during that period of time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On Monday, March 9, during an afternoon recess, the court informed the parties that Juror 18A had raised a potential conflict with continuing to serve beyond the end of that week:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   THE COURT: [Juror 18A] had mentioned to us, I think during voir dire that she had a conflict with next Saturday.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   [THE STATE]: Oh she started to raise her hand at the tail end of the testimony yesterday [sic].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   THE COURT: Yes, so she had mentioned to my law clerk, you know how do things look? Or she was concerned because she's a keynote speaker at a conference in Las Vegas and she's leaving on Saturday. So she's brought up about 3 or 4 times so I just had my law clerk-did you tell her what I told you? I just said tell her that we'll deal with it on Friday. That we're not going to stand in the way of her going to her conference. My intention is that maybe we'll be done, maybe not. If we're not we'll just see how we look on Friday and we have everybody, all 14 still going, my thought would be we can talk about this more later if you want to talk about it. My thought would be to tell her to go to Las Vegas, do your thing. Come Monday morning excuse her once we know that we've got at least 12 or 13 people left-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Do we know how long she's going to be there?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   THE COURT: -and if we find out Monday morning that we're in trouble without her, we may end up having to skip a few days. She's coming back on Wednesday. So the worst case scenario, rather than have a mistrial we'll just skip a couple of days.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   [THE STATE]: Have them continue deliberation assuming they started something on a Wednesday instead of on a Monday.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   THE COURT: Yes, well I don't know that we need to keep her on if we're\n   going into deliberations. I'm just saying if we're still in trial-\n   [THE STATE]: If we're still presenting evidence?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   THE COURT: I'm really giving you a heads up mainly to tell you about the communication that my clerk told her you know, this won't keep you from going to Las Vegas for your conference, okay.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Thank you.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   [DEFENSE CO-COUNSEL]: Thank you.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   At the close of proceedings on Wednesday, March 11, the court had another conversation with the parties regarding Juror 18A. One of the parties\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   asked the court about its plans for the juror assuming the trial continued beyond that Friday. The court thought there was a \"really good chance that deliberations are going to carry over until Monday,\" and stated that Juror 18A would not be deliberating if the deliberations started on Friday. Defense counsel stated that he did not want \"to cut her,\" and proposed postponing deliberations until Juror 18A returned from her conference. The court responded that the juror's keynote speech was on Monday, and she would not return until Wednesday. The court told the parties, \"I wouldn't hold my breath on her being on the jury.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   On Thursday, March 12 at 3:00 p.m., Juror 18A sent a note to the court again expressing her concern that she would not be able to serve on the jury the following Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday. The juror also stated in her note, \"After investing 2 weeks in this trial, I would like to see it through but certainly understand if I am excused.\" The court notified the parties of this note on the morning of Friday, March 13, before delivering jury instructions and hearing closing arguments. After reading the contents of the note on the record, the court stated its reaction: \"I think it is inappropriate to compel her to forego her presentations. So I'm prepared to find that she is unable to perform her service and to place the first alternate in her place. Does anybody need to discuss that briefly?\" Defense counsel asked to discuss the situation, and\n   stated that Juror 18A should not be excused. Defense counsel again proposed that deliberations be postponed until the juror returned from her conference. Defense counsel also suggested that deliberations could begin that day (Friday), and could continue late into the night, if necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The court responded that it would be \"highly burdensome on the other jurors to have them on hold for several days.\" Therefore, the court stated that it was exercising its discretion under Maryland Rule 4-312\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   in finding that Juror 18A was \"unable to adequately perform jury service\" and replacing her with an alternate at the beginning of deliberations. The court noted that it would wait until Monday morning to officially excuse Juror 18A and the second alternate, in case something happened over the weekend that would leave them with less than twelve jurors. In that case, the court would accept defense counsel's proposal to delay deliberations until Juror 18A returned, \"but only to avoid a mistrial with 11 or fewer jurors.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   At the close of proceedings on Friday, March 13, before deliberations began, the court told Juror 18A to go to her conference, and that she would be excused on Monday morning assuming there were no problems with the other jurors. The court also told Juror 18A not to discuss their conversation with the other jurors. Juror 18A told the court that the other jurors already knew that she was leaving and that she \"would probably be dismissed after today.\" The court responded that that was fine, as long as she did not tell the other jurors about the back-up plan of potentially delaying deliberations until Thursday. On Monday, March 16, the court officially excused Juror 18A from her service, and replaced her with an alternate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   After approximately five hours of deliberations, the jury convicted Mr. Gupta of first-degree murder. On May 27, 2015,\n   the court sentenced Mr. Gupta to life imprisonment. Mr. Gupta appealed his conviction to the Court of Special Appeals, which affirmed the judgment of the circuit court in a reported opinion issued on April 29, 2016.\n   <em>\n    Gupta v.

Ex Parte Communication Between the Circuit Court and Juror 18A\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Mr. Gupta argues that the circuit court violated Maryland Rule 4-326(d)(2)(C) when it told Juror 18A that she would not miss her conference without first informing the parties of the communication and providing them an opportunity for input.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Mr. Gupta asserts that the State has not met its burden of showing that this\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   communication was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, and therefore he is entitled to a new a trial. The State responds that the circuit court did not violate Rule 4-326(d)(2)(C) because the communication did not \"pertain to the action.\" Alternatively, the State asserts that even if the circuit court did violate the Rule, the violation was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt because Juror 18A did not participate in deliberations, and therefore could not have affected the outcome of the trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Rule 4-326(d)(2) governs communications between the court and jurors:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   (A) A court official or employee who receives any written or oral communication from the jury or a juror shall immediately notify the presiding judge of the communication.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   (B) The judge shall determine whether the communication pertains to the action. If the judge determines that the communication does not pertain to the action, the judge may respond as he or she deems appropriate.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   (C) If the judge determines that the communication pertains to the action, the judge shall promptly, and before responding to the communication, direct that the parties be notified of the communication and invite and consider, on the record, the parties' position on any response. The judge may respond to the communication in writing or orally in open court on the record.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The parties do not dispute that the communication between the trial judge's law clerk and Juror 18A about whether she would be able to attend her conference is governed by this Rule.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Instead, the parties dispute whether the communication \"pertain[ed] to the action,\" such that the trial judge was\n   required to follow the procedures outlined in paragraph (C), or whether the communication did not \"pertain to the action,\" such that the trial judge was free to \"respond as he ... deem[ed] appropriate\" under paragraph (B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Mr. Gupta argues that the communication pertained to the action because it concerned Juror 18A's ability to continue serving on the jury and eventually deliberate. The State contends that the communication did not pertain to the action because it concerned a \"routine administrative matter\" regarding \"a possible future scheduling problem,\" rather than a \"substantive discussion of trial matters [as] contemplated by the [R]ule.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \"[C]ommunications raising issues that 'implicate and concern the juror's ability to continue deliberating' pertain[ ] to the action\" under Rule 4-326(d)(2).\n   <em>\n    Grade v.

We recognize that, prior to the Court of Special Appeals' opinion below, \"no reported Maryland appellate case [had] held that the State met its burden of proving that a trial court's\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   communication with a juror was harmless.\"\n   <em>\n    Gupta\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4237720\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/227/718/#p749\">\n    227 Md.App. at 728\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4237720\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/227/718/#p749\">\n    135 A.3d 926\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In that\n   case, \"had the communication been disclosed when it occurred, the alternate jurors would have been available to replace the juror.

Moreover, unlike in\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   , Mr. Gupta and his counsel were not denied an opportunity \"to provide input on how to proceed.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3713009\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/428/700/#p715\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Although the parties were not informed of Juror 18A's inquiry before the court responded to it, as required by Rule 4-326(d)(2)(C), they were informed at a time when the court still had options before it regarding how to resolve the situation, and the parties had the opportunity to provide their input on those options. In fact, defense counsel provided his input to the circuit court on three separate occasions after being informed of the communication, but before the court made its decision to dismiss the juror.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Similarly, in\n   <em>\n    Grade\n   </em>\n   , the defendant was prejudiced by the\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   communication because it resulted in the judge dismissing a juror and replacing her with an alternate without receiving input from the parties.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Grade\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3717638\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/431/85/#p100\">\n    431 Md. at 105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3717638\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/431/85/#p100\">\n    64 A.3d 197\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The notification of counsel and their opportunity to have input are missing from the case at bar.\"). Here, although the circuit court ultimately rejected defense counsel's proposals for how to resolve Juror 18A's scheduling conflict, its decision to dismiss the juror and replace her with an alternate was only made\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   considering and rejecting those proposals on the record. We conclude that defense counsel's multiple opportunities to provide input on how to address the situation\n   with Juror 18A, and the circuit court's acknowledgement on the record that it considered and rejected defense counsel's suggestions, are sufficient to distinguish this case from cases like\n   <em>\n    Grade\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   , where no such input occurred. Furthermore, because both parties were provided an opportunity to offer input on how to resolve the situation before the court made its ultimate decision to dismiss Juror 18A, we cannot see how Mr. Gupta was prejudiced by the delay of one business day in being notified about the initial communication between the juror and the judge's law clerk.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Therefore, we hold that the State has satisfied its burden of establishing that the trial judge's violation of Rule 4-326(d)(2)(C) was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.

Thus, we hold that, while there may be some instances in which a suspect could invoke his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights post-custody but pre-interrogation,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4244715\" index=\"176\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/219/295/#p322\">\n    219 Md.App. at 322\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4244715\" index=\"177\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/219/295/#p322\">\n    100 A.3d 1208\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , this case falls well outside the scope of any permissible definition of \"imminence\" in the sense of an impending interrogation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   As in\n   <em>\n    Costley\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Hoerauf\n   </em>\n   , Mr. Gupta's requests for a lawyer came when he was still in a holding cell, before any interrogation had taken place. The requests were made to an officer who was guarding him, rather than the detectives who later questioned him (although the officer did relay the message to the detectives). At no time after entering the interrogation room until the end of the fifty-five-minute interrogation did Mr. Gupta ask for the assistance of counsel.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hoerauf\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3597243\" index=\"178\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/178/292/#p304\">\n    178 Md.App. at 318\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3597243\" index=\"179\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/178/292/#p304\">\n    941 A.2d 1161\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Furthermore, Mr. Gupta's requests for a lawyer occurred at 5:05 a.m., according to Officer Richardson. Detectives Hamill and Fumagalli arrived between ten and thirty minutes later, and the interrogation did not begin until a full three hours after Mr. Gupta exclaimed his demands from the holding cell. This is not, in any sense of the word, \"imminent.\" It is irrelevant whether the detectives knew that Mr. Gupta had been asking for a lawyer before the interrogation began, because the\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights to counsel and to silence \"must be\n   asserted when the government seeks to take the action they protect against.\"\n   <em>\n    McNeil\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1108476\" index=\"180\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/501/171/#p178\">\n    501 U.S. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   182 n.3,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1108476\" index=\"181\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/501/171/#p178\">\n    111 S.Ct. 2204\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, we hold that Mr. Gupta's requests to see a lawyer, made while in a holding cell prior to interrogation, were made outside the context of custodial interrogation, and thus did not constitute an invocation of his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   right to counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Finally, we address Mr. Gupta's contention that his asking, \"When do I get to talk ...,\" before being interrupted by Detective Hamill is somehow relevant to whether his pre-interrogation comments served as an invocation of\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   . The parties do not dispute that at the time this statement was made (unlike the earlier statements), Mr. Gupta was subjected to custodial interrogation, and therefore his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights had attached. At that point, the detectives had taken him into the interrogation room, they had asked him questions about his background and present state of mind, and they had read him his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   But to the extent Mr. Gupta contends that this statement affects whether his pre-interrogation comments served to invoke his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   right to counsel, we reject that contention. We reiterate that, regardless of what the detectives knew before the interrogation began, Mr. Gupta was still required to assert his desire to have counsel present\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   his rights had attached, or \"when the government seeks to take the action they protect against.\"\n   <em>\n    McNeil\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1108476\" index=\"182\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/501/171/#p178\">\n    501 U.S. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   182 n.3,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1108476\" index=\"183\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/501/171/#p178\">\n    111 S.Ct. 2204\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Additionally, to the extent Mr. Gupta contends that this statement was itself an invocation of his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   right to counsel, we reject that contention as well. Even if we were to assume that Mr. Gupta would have finished his question, \"When do I get to talk ...,\" by asking for a lawyer, and not Ms. Gould, his parents, or anyone else, this still would not have been the type of unambiguous expression of a desire to have counsel present that the Supreme Court and our precedents require.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39831\" index=\"184\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/452/#p457\">\n    512 U.S. at 459\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39831\" index=\"185\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/452/#p457\">\n    114 S.Ct. 2350\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[The suspect] must articulate his desire to have counsel present sufficiently clearly that a reasonable police officer in\n   the circumstances would understand the statement to be a request for an attorney.\");\n   <em>\n    Ballard v.

However, this error was harmless because the circuit court did subsequently provide the parties an opportunity for input, and considered defense counsel's proposals on the record, before finally acting on the juror's inquiry by dismissing that juror before deliberations. In addition, we hold that the circuit court did not err in denying Mr. Gupta's motion to suppress the statements he made to detectives during his interrogation, because Mr. Gupta did not unambiguously assert his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   right to have counsel present at any time during the interrogation.

I agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Here, given when the interruption occurred-seconds after Detective Hamill\n   finished reading Mr. Gupta his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights-a reasonable police officer would have understood that when Mr. Gupta began saying, \"When do I get to talk ...,\" he\n   was attempting to assert his rights. Even if a reasonable officer may have been unsure whether this was an attempted invocation, Mr. Gupta's pre-interrogation requests for counsel resolve any ambiguity. Although Detective Hamill did not remember whether she was told about Mr. Gupta's prior requests, Detective Fumagalli, who was also in the room, testified that she was aware of them. When asked whether she knew if there was a \"substantial probability\" that Mr. Gupta was going to ask for a lawyer if she did not cut him off, even Detective Hamill acknowledged that \"it certainly is a possibility.\" The timing-only seconds after finishing the\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings-and this testimony, undercut the Majority's assertion that \"nothing prevented Mr. Gupta from requesting a lawyer at any other time during the ... interrogation\" because her own methodology, if repeated, may have done just that.
