On appeal, the defendant claims that (1) the trial court erroneously denied his motion to suppress two photographic lineup identifications and one private actor identification, (2) the state improperly cross-examined his expert witness when it questioned him about the opinions of other experts and about a hypothetical question that included\n   facts not in evidence,\n   and (3) the prosecutor engaged in multiple acts of prosecutorial impropriety. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. At approximately noon on May 2, 2013, Lester Segura was in his bedroom with his girlfriend, Angie Espitia, when he heard someone enter his residence. Segura hid behind his bedroom door and peered around it to see the defendant standing in his residence. From his room, Segura asked the defendant why he was there and asked him several times to leave. The defendant responded that he knocked on the front door and noticed that it was open, so he \"just came in.\" During this exchange, Segura looked around the door three times. He observed the defendant for a total of fifteen to twenty seconds but saw the defendant's \"full face\" for approximately three to four seconds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   When the defendant exited the residence through the front door, Segura went outside and observed the defendant \"walking fast\" down the street toward a liquor and dress store. Gabriel Duarte, an employee of the store, was sweeping the sidewalk when he observed the defendant exit Segura's residence. Duarte was \"face-to-face\" with the defendant for approximately five seconds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Segura went back inside his residence and noticed that his computer, iPad, and tools were on the couch where he had not left them. He then went into his brother's room and saw that somebody had moved his brother's coin jar. Espitia called 911, but before the police arrived, Segura realized that he recognized the defendant from \"[i]n the store, [and] out on the street.\" He also thought that he had seen the defendant previously on the local news. He quickly checked News Channel 12 from his cell phone and found the defendant's photograph, which was displayed in relation to\n   another burglary that took place approximately two weeks prior.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On May 8, 2013, Segura identified the defendant in a double-blind,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   sequential\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   photographic lineup\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   as the man he saw in his residence. One and one-half weeks before trial, Duarte identified the defendant in a different double-blind, sequential photographic lineup as the man he saw leaving Segura's residence. Duarte told police that he had seen the defendant prior to May 2, 2013, walking around the neighborhood. He also stated that the defendant previously had shopped at Duarte's store and that Duarte had once purchased a toy bubble gun from the defendant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The defendant was charged with burglary in the second degree and attempted larceny in the fifth degree. On July 14, 2014, the defendant filed a motion to suppress any identifications of him by Segura and Duarte. On August 18, 2014, the court conducted an evidentiary hearing, and on August 19, 2014, the court denied the defendant's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   During the defendant's case-in-chief, he called Samuel R. Sommers, an associate professor at Tufts University, to testify about the unreliability of eyewitness identifications. The state cross-examined Sommers about other experts' opinions pertaining to the reliability of these studies. The state also posed a hypothetical question to Sommers. Defense counsel did not object to either line of questioning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   During his closing and rebuttal arguments, the prosecutor stated that Sommers' testimony actually supported the state's theory that Segura and Duarte made accurate identifications of the defendant, reiterating the hypothetical he posed to Sommers. In addition, without tying his assertion to any evidence admitted at trial, the prosecutor opined that the defendant planned on selling Segura's property to a pawn shop.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On August 22, 2014, the jury found the defendant guilty on both counts. The court sentenced the defendant to ten years incarceration for the burglary in the second degree conviction and six months for the attempted larceny in the fifth degree conviction, for a total effective sentence of ten and one-half years. This appeal followed. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   IDENTIFICATIONS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The defendant's first claim is that the court erroneously denied the defendant's motion to suppress the identifications of him by Segura and Duarte. Specifically, the defendant claims that the photographs viewed by Segura and Duarte were unduly suggestive and that the process\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   by which police showed Duarte the photographs was unduly suggestive.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendant also\n   claims that Segura's private actor identification, when he identified the defendant from the news article, was the product of Segura's unduly suggestive conduct.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The state claims that the police actions were not unduly suggestive because the police conducted double-blind, sequential lineups, and the photographs were not unduly suggestive because the defendant's photograph\n   \"was not highlighted in comparison to the other photographs.\" The state also claims that \"Segura's use of his cell phone to access an online ... picture did not constitute an unnecessarily suggestive method of identification.\" We agree with the state and conclude that no part of the identification was the product of unnecessarily suggestive conduct and, therefore, do not reach the question of whether the identifications were otherwise unreliable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The following additional facts, which are either in the record or which the court found in ruling on the motion to suppress, are relevant to this claim. During the 911 phone call made by Espitia, Segura described the defendant as a \"bald [and] black\" man. Shortly after, Daniel Musso, an officer of the Stamford Police Department (department), responded to the 911 call made by Espitia. When he arrived at Segura's residence, Segura described the defendant as a \"black bald man\" between the ages of forty and fifty years old. He also told Musso that he had seen the defendant prior to the incident\n   and showed Musso the photograph of the defendant he found from the news. Musso did not ask Segura to locate the photograph and did not see the photograph until after he started his investigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Peter Dispagna, a sergeant with the department, created two different photographic lineups, both of which included a photograph of the defendant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the photographic lineup shown to Segura, the defendant was the oldest person depicted in the photographs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendant's height fell within the range of the other individuals' heights, and the defendant and three other individuals were bald while the rest of the individuals had hair of varying lengths.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   The seven other individuals wore black and white shirts while the defendant wore an orange shirt. In the photographic lineup shown to Duarte, the defendant was not the oldest person depicted but was the only person who was bald.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On May 8, 2013, William Moore, an investigator with the department, conducted a double-blind, sequential photographic lineup with Segura. He read Segura the instructions on the witness instruction sheet before he conducted the photographic lineup, which included instructions that \"[t]he perpetrator may or may not be\n   among the persons in the photographic line up,\" and \"[t]he persons in the photographic lineup ... may not look exactly as they did on the date of the offense because features like facial or head hair can change.\" Segura looked at all of the photographs as Moore turned them over one by one, and he immediately identified the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Approximately one and one-half weeks before the trial, Damien Rosa, an officer\n   with the department, conducted a double-blind, sequential photographic lineup with Duarte. Rosa read the same instructions to Duarte as were read to Segura in English and in Spanish. After observing all of the photographs, Duarte immediately identified the defendant. Dispagna remained in the room while Rosa conducted the photographic lineup but did not assist Rosa in conducting the lineup or \"say a word throughout the entire process.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Prior to trial, the defendant filed a motion to suppress any identifications of him by Segura and Duarte, including the photographic lineup identifications and Segura's private actor identification of the defendant from the news article. On August 18, 2014, the court held an evidentiary hearing on the motion to suppress, in which a number of witnesses, including Musso and Duarte, testified. On August 19, 2014, the court rendered an oral decision, denying the defendant's motion to suppress. It found that neither the photographs themselves nor the procedures used by police to obtain the identifications were \"unnecessarily suggestive.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   It also found\n   Segura's \"conduct [not] to be unnecessarily suggestive.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Photographic Lineup Identifications\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The defendant claims on appeal that the court erroneously denied his motion to suppress the photographic lineup identifications by Segura and Duarte. With regard to Segura's photograph lineup identification, the defendant argues that the photographs in the lineup were unnecessarily suggestive because only one individual in the photographs \"was close in age to the defendant.\" In addition, \"[m]any of the individuals in the photographs ... were significantly shorter than the defendant and had hair,\" and \"the defendant was the only individual wearing a colored shirt.\" With regard to Duarte's identification, the defendant argues that the photographs used in the procedure were unnecessarily suggestive because of the \"lack of likeness shared by the individuals pictured and the prominence of the defendant's photograph.\" He also argues that the conduct of police was unnecessarily suggestive because Dispagna, who was \"someone who knew the defendant,\" was present during the procedure. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \"Upon review of a trial court's denial of a motion to suppress, [t]he court's conclusions will not be disturbed unless they are legally and logically inconsistent with the facts.... Because the issue of the reliability of an identification involves the constitutional rights of an accused ... we are obliged to examine the record scrupulously to determine whether the facts\n   found are adequately supported by the evidence and whether the\n   court's ultimate inference of reliability was reasonable.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Elliston\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4002266\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/86/479/#p482\">\n    86 Conn.App. 479\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 482-83,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=861%20A.2d%20563\">\n    861 A.2d 563\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2004), cert. denied,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5706403,5708470,5707255\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/273/906/\">\n    273 Conn. 906\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=868%20A.2d%20746\">\n    868 A.2d 746\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2005).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \"[T]he required inquiry is made on an ad hoc basis and is two-pronged: first, it must be determined whether the identification procedure was unnecessarily suggestive; and second, if it is found to have been so, it must be determined whether the identification was nevertheless reliable based on examination of the totality of the circumstances....

After a review of\n   the record, we agree with the court's finding that \"there was nothing improper about the degree of likeness shared by the individuals pictured in each photo array.\" The differences in hair styles between the individuals are slight; for example, there is little variation between being \"bald\" and a having \"flat top\" hairstyle. There is nothing in the photographs that indicate that there are height differences between the individuals because the photographs only show the individuals' heads and shoulders, and there are no visible height indicators. The differences in age are not dispositive because the analysis focuses on the \"likeness\" of the individuals, and most of the individuals look similar in age to the defendant. The only difference that arguably could differentiate the defendant's photograph from the others is that he is the only one wearing a colored shirt. Yet, there is nothing in the record to indicate that the orange shirt influenced Segura's decision in choosing the defendant's photograph.

Even though Segura identified the defendant from the news article prior to the photographic lineup, the defendant provided no evidence that either Segura or Duarte knew that the defendant's photograph was included in the photographic array.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   We also conclude that the photographic lineup procedures in the present case were not unnecessarily suggestive. The police did nothing to bring Segura's or Duarte's unwarranted attention to the defendant's photograph.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendant failed to produce any evidence\n   that either Moore or Rosa influenced Segura's or Duarte's selection of the defendant's photograph. In fact, neither Moore nor Rosa were aware of who the target was or whether the defendant was included within the photographic lineup. In addition, the witness instruction sheet was read to both Segura and Duarte, and the instructions gave an affirmative warning that the suspect's photograph may or may not be part of the photographic lineup. Specifically with regard to Duarte's photographic lineup procedure, Dispagna was not near either Rosa or Duarte during the procedure and did not speak to Duarte until after the completion of the photographic lineup. In short, both photographic lineup procedures were conducted in a nonsuggestive manner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Accordingly, we conclude that the identifications were not products of unnecessarily suggestive actions on the part of the police.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Private Actor Identification\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The defendant also argues on appeal that the court erroneously denied his motion to suppress the private actor identification by Segura. The defendant asserts that prior to May 2, 2013, \"Segura read a\n   news article related to a burglary [and] the defendant's picture was displayed in that article next to a female, but no other males.\" Not until after Segura observed the defendant in his residence did he \"conduct ...

I never speak to him, I don't even know his name. But then one-at one point I see this same person commit a crime. And then at some point later on I'm asked to identify this same person.

In this case,\n   <em>\n    the same facts apply\n   </em>\n   and we did do a line up and he picked the right guy.\" (Emphasis added.) During his rebuttal argument, the prosecutor invited the jury to \"recall the train example I used with Dr. Sommers. I gave an example to Dr. Sommers when he was-when he was sitting there about if you\n   <em>\n    took the same train every day\n   </em>\n   , you never talked to this person, you never even-you never had a conversation, didn't know his name, never talked to him. You took the train with him and you\n   <em>\n    recognized him from just from that train\n   </em>\n   .... Dr. Sommers sat there and said there would be no reason to even do a lineup ...

If you saw somebody doing a crime, even if you didn't know their name, didn't-and never really talked to him and just saw him on the train\n   <em>\n    the same time every day\n   </em>\n   . You saw that person commit a crime, that that identification would be accurate ...\n   <em>\n    the same facts apply\n   </em>\n   . Mr. Segura had seen the ... defendant ... in the past....

The hypothetical posited that one would be more likely to make an accurate identification of an individual if he or she saw that individual\n   <em>\n    every day\n   </em>\n   at the\n   <em>\n    same time\n   </em>\n   and in the\n   <em>\n    same place\n   </em>\n   as opposed to never having seen that individual before. In the present case, neither Segura nor Duarte testified that they observed the defendant every day at the same time and\n   in the same place. Rather, Segura testified that he had only seen the defendant on a couple of occasions \"[i]n the store, [and] out on the street,\" and Duarte had only seen the defendant on three or four occasions in different places. Because the facts in the hypothetical were wholly different from the facts that were adduced at trial, the argument was improper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   2\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Mischaracterization of Expert Testimony\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The defendant claims that the prosecutor mischaracterized Sommers' testimony.

The prosecutor merely invited the jury to make the reasonable inference that because Sommers testified that an identification is more likely to be accurate if one makes it quickly, Segura's and Duarte's identifications were accurate due to the speed in which they made the identifications.

The prosecutor's comments were not calculated to lead the jury to find the defendant guilty out of sympathy for Segura and Espitia. Instead, the prosecutor took the opportunity to cast Segura and Espitia in a sympathetic light without distracting the jury from the main point of his argument, mainly, that the defendant was the person responsible\n   for attempting to steal Segura's property.

We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   The prosecutor argued that the police \"had four identifications ten minutes after the crime.... [The photographic lineup identification by Segura] wasn't necessary for me to bring charges against [the defendant]. I already had the identification ten minutes after this crime had already occurred.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   \"[A] prosecutor may not express his own opinion, directly or indirectly, as to the credibility of the witnesses.... Nor should a prosecutor express his opinion, directly or indirectly, as to the guilt of the defendant. ... Such expressions of personal opinion are a form of unsworn and unchecked testimony, and are particularly difficult for the jury to ignore because of the prosecutor's special position.... Moreover, because the jury is aware that the prosecutor has prepared and presented the case and consequently, may have access to matters not in evidence ... it is likely to infer that such matters precipitated the personal opinions.... It is not, however, improper for the prosecutor to comment upon the evidence presented at trial and to argue the inferences that the jurors might draw therefrom ....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   \"Although prosecutors generally should try to avoid using phrases that begin with the pronoun I ... we recognize that the use of the word I is part of our everyday parlance and ... because of established\n   speech patterns, it cannot always easily be eliminated completely from extemporaneous elocution.... Furthermore, [t]he state's attorney should not be put in the rhetorical straightjacket of always using the passive voice, or continually emphasizing that he is simply saying I submit to you that this is what the evidence shows .... Therefore, if it is clear that the prosecutor is arguing from the evidence presented at trial, instead of giving improper unsworn testimony with the suggestion of secret knowledge, his or her occasional use of the first person does not constitute misconduct.

We do not consider the prosecutor's comments to even approach the sort of grossly egregious misconduct requiring reversal. To the extent that defense counsel objected to the mischaracterization of Sommers' testimony, we note that defense counsel failed to take any curative measures, such as asking the court for a jury instruction to disregard the comments, which indicates that defense counsel presumably did not think that the comments were so severe as\n   to have a negative effect on the jury. Whether defense counsel objected to the impropriety, moreover, is only one factor in determining whether an impropriety was so severe as to affect the outcome of a trial-the existence of an objection, by itself, is not enough to deem an impropriety so severe that it violates the defendant's right to a fair trial.

The main issue in the case was the identity of the perpetrator of the crime. The pawn shop statements were unrelated to this issue, as they were only comments about what the defendant planned to do with the stolen items. However, both the hypothetical and the mischaracterization of Sommers' testimony commented on the reliability of Segura's and Duarte's identifications. Because the prosecutor's case primarily relied on the reliability of these identifications, the statements were relevant to the critical issue of the case.

The court did not give a special instruction to the jury to disregard the statements at issue. The court did, however, give a general instruction that closing arguments are not considered evidence but are only \"intended to help [the jury] interpret the evidence\" and that if a member of the jury remembers a fact differently than what was presented during closing arguments, his or her \"memory ... controls.\" Importantly, \"the defendant, by failing to bring them to the attention of the trial court, bears much of the responsibility for the fact that these claimed improprieties went uncured.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Stevenson\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8458155\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/269/563/#p591\">\n    269 Conn. at 597\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=849%20A.2d%20626\">\n    849 A.2d 626\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

It presented a solid case\n   against the defendant for both the burglary in the second degree charge and attempted larceny in the fifth degree charge. For the burglary charge, Segura testified that he clearly saw the defendant's face while the defendant was in his residence. He also quickly identified the defendant in a double-blind, sequential photographic lineup and from the news article as the man who was in his residence. Duarte testified that he saw the defendant's face as he exited Segura's residence,\n   and he identified the defendant in a double-blind, sequential photographic lineup more than one year later as the man he saw exiting the residence.
