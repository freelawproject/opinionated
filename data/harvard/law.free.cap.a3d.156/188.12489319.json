Specifically, we dismissed the cross-appeal because Heartland failed to \"submit the items that had been submitted to the trial court on the summary judgment motion or even a statement of the items submitted.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 500,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12301910\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/448/486/\">\n    154\n    <em>\n     A.\n    </em>\n    3d 178\n   </extracted-citation>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Heartland now moves for reconsideration, arguing we mistakenly employed\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   2:6-1(a)(1). In Heartland's view, the obligation to include in the appendix \"all items submitted to the court on the summary judgment motion\" and \"a statement of all items\" applies only-in the words of the\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   -to an appeal \"from a summary judgment,\" and there can only be \"a summary judgment\" upon the\n   <em>\n    grant\n   </em>\n   of a summary judgment motion. Heartland argues that it only cross-appealed from a\n   <em>\n    denial\n   </em>\n   of summary judgment, not \"from a summary judgment.\" Hence, Heartland contends we should reconsider our rule-based disposition and review the cross-appeal on its merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   To be sure, Heartland's argument has color because of the\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   's particular wording. We nevertheless find the argument lacking in merit. As Judge Learned Hand famously said, \"[t]here is no surer way to misread any document than to read it literally.\"\n   <em>\n    Guiseppi v.

Despite the superficial appeal of Heartland's literal\n   construction of\n   the phrase \"from a summary judgment,\" the\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   was obviously intended to precisely identify for the reviewing court that which was presented to the trial court \"on the motion for summary judgment,\" regardless of how the motion was decided. Whether a summary judgment motion is granted, denied, or granted in part and denied in part, an appellate court is limited to an examination of \"the original summary judgment record.\"\n   <em>\n    Lombardi v.

A party's compliance with the\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   clarifies for the reviewing court the parameters of the \"original summary judgment record\"; if it didn't apply in all the ways in which a trial judge might dispose of a summary judgment motion, an appellate court could easily stray from its proper function by affirming or reversing in light of material never presented when the trial judge considered the motion. We reject Heartland's invitation to read the\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   literally, and we conclude that the phrase \"from a summary judgment\" should be understood as including appeals taken \"from the disposition of a summary judgment motion.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The motion for reconsideration is denied.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-16\">\n    Heartland cites\n    <em>\n     Rios v.
