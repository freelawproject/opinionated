In this appeal we deal with an arbitration clause that seeks to preserve for a lender the right to sue a credit card debtor in small claims court, but insist on arbitration of all other claims relating to the debtor's account. Here, the lender's assignee, while operating as an unlicensed debt collector, obtained a $4,520.54 judgment against the debtor in the District Court of Maryland, sitting in Baltimore City. The assignee now seeks to arbitrate the debtor's later-filed class action suit collaterally attacking the judgment based on violations of Maryland consumer protection laws. We address whether the assignee, in pursuing its earlier district court suit, waived its right to arbitrate the debtor's claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In 2003, Clifford Cain, Jr., opened an AT &amp; T Universal Savings and Rewards Card account with Citibank. Cain's contract with Citibank included an arbitration provision that allowed either party to \"elect mandatory, binding arbitration for any claim, dispute, or controversy between [Cain] and [Citibank].\" Additionally, it provided that the arbitration\n   clause would survive \"any transfer, sale or assignment of [Cain's] account, or any amounts owed to [his] account, to any other person or entity.\" In 2007, Cain stopped making payments on his Citibank account. In 2008, Citibank sold all of the rights, title, and interest in Cain's account to Midland Funding, LLC (\"Midland\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On March 30, 2009, Midland filed a small claims action against Cain in the District Court of Maryland, sitting in Baltimore City, for the outstanding balance on his Citibank account (\"the collection action\"). The court entered a default judgment against Cain for $4,520.54. Under the Maryland Collection Agency Licensing Act (\"MCALA\"), with limited exceptions, companies doing business as a \"collection agency\" must be licensed by the State. Md. Code (1957, 2015 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 7-301 of the Business Regulation Article (\"BR\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although the MCALA required Midland to be licensed when it brought suit against Cain, it did not become licensed until almost a year later.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On June 23, 2013, the Court of Special Appeals issued an opinion allowing debtors to collaterally attack judgments obtained by unlicensed collection agencies.

Cain argued that the judgments Midland obtained against him and the other class members were void under\n   <em>\n    Finch\n   </em>\n   . He brought claims for declaratory and injunctive relief related to the enforcement of the void judgments, unjust enrichment, and violations of the Maryland Consumer Debt Collection Act (\"MCDCA\"), Maryland Code (1957, 2013 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 14-202(8) of the Commercial Law Article (\"CL\"),\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the Maryland Consumer Protection Act, Maryland Code (1957, 2013 Repl. Vol., 2016 Supp.), CL \u00a7 13-301(14)(iii).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Cain requested a money judgment \"for violations of the MCDCA ... and for purposes of a sum certain directly related to the judgment sums, pre- and post-judgment interest and costs (including attorney's fees).\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Shortly after Cain brought suit, Midland and Cain filed a consent motion to stay the class action pending the appeal of\n   <em>\n    Finch\n   </em>\n   to this Court. The Circuit Court granted the stay. On October 8, 2013, this Court denied\n   <em>\n    certiorari\n   </em>\n   in\n   <em>\n    Finch\n   </em>\n   , and two weeks later the Circuit Court lifted the stay in Cain's class action. Midland then moved to compel arbitration and stay the court proceedings,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   or, alternatively, dismiss Cain's complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Circuit Court stayed discovery and held a trial on the existence of an arbitration agreement between Cain and Midland. After finding that such an agreement did exist, the Circuit Court granted Midland's motion to compel arbitration. The Circuit Court rejected Cain's argument that Midland waived its right to arbitrate when it brought its 2009 collection action against Cain.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Cain appealed to the Court of Special Appeals, which affirmed. The intermediate appellate court held that Midland did not waive its right to arbitrate by pursuing a small claims action against Cain, seeking court approval of two class settlements in\n   <em>\n    Vassalle v. Midland Funding LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3542055\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/708/747/\">\n    708 F.3d 747\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (6th Cir. 2013), or filing a consent motion to stay Cain's class action pending the appeal of\n   <em>\n    Finch\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Cain v.

Cain argues that we should review the Circuit Court's determination that Midland did not waive its contractual right to arbitrate without deference. He contends that the question of whether Midland's 2009 collection action was \"sufficiently related\" to the claims before us to constitute a waiver of the right to arbitrate is a question of law that we should review afresh. By contrast, Midland argues that the question of whether it waived its right to arbitrate is a factual inquiry that we should review only for clear error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   When the determination of waiver turns on factual analysis, we inquire whether that finding was clearly erroneous.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brendsel v.

The Majority's overly broad definition of \"related claims\" under\n   <em>\n    Frank\n   </em>\n   contradicts \"Maryland's legislative policy favoring enforcement of executory agreements to arbitrate.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Charles J.
