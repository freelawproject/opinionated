The respondent contends, more specifically, that the department's efforts to reunify him with his daughter were not reasonable because it failed to conduct an adequate investigation into the availability and suitability of two of his relatives, his mother and his sister, Jennifer D., to serve as possible placement resources for Unique after she was taken into the petitioner's custody pursuant to an ex parte order of temporary custody at an earlier stage of the investigation that led ultimately to the filing of a termination petition against him. The respondent claims that the department's failure to conduct an adequate investigation into the availability and suitability of his mother and his sister to serve as possible placement resources for Unique, after he had provided their names and contact information to the department for that purpose, precluded the trial court from finding that the department had made reasonable efforts to reunify him with his daughter, and thus requires this court to reverse the trial court's judgment terminating his parental rights.\n   We disagree with the respondent for two primary reasons. First, the department's investigation of relative resources is not aimed at the reunification of the child with his or her parent and is therefore not a necessary consideration when determining whether to terminate a parent's parental rights. Second, even if the department's alleged failure to exercise due diligence in investigating relative resources was a proper consideration in assessing the reasonableness of its efforts to reunify the respondent with his daughter, said assessment is based upon a totality of the circumstances, taking multiple factors into consideration. We thus affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This case arises against the background of the following factual and procedural history, as described by the trial court in its memorandum of decision terminating the respondent's parental rights to Unique. Unique was born in January, 2011, to her mother, Kaycee R. The respondent, Unique's biological father, was not present for her birth and, in fact, had no contact with her throughout the first two years of her life. Thereafter, in February, 2013, the department received an anonymous phone call concerning the health and safety of Unique and Jeramiah P., her half brother by another father, who were then living in their mother's home. During its ensuing investigation as to the children's welfare, the department initially allowed the children\n   to remain in the custody of Kaycee R. while providing her with assistance in caring for them. When that arrangement proved to be unsuccessful, however, the petitioner filed separate neglect petitions as to each child on November 14, 2013, on the common ground that they were being denied proper care in their mother's home, where the living conditions were injurious to their well-being.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On January 21, 2014, the petitioner invoked a ninety-six hour hold as to Unique and Jeramiah, pursuant to\n   General Statutes \u00a7 17a-101g(e),\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and removed them from their mother's home, citing concerns that the home environment posed an immediate physical danger to them. Three days later, on January 24, 2014, the petitioner requested the issuance of an ex parte order of temporary custody. The ex parte order was issued by the trial court,\n   <em>\n    Kaplan, J.,\n   </em>\n   on January 27, 2014. After Unique was taken into custody by the petitioner, she was diagnosed as suffering from asthma and anemia, was found to have high levels of lead in her blood, and was determined to be experiencing developmental delays.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Upon issuing the ex parte order of temporary custody, the court provided the respondent, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46b-129(b),\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   with several \"preliminary specific steps,\" which it deemed necessary for him to take in order to address the problems that had led to the issuance of the order of temporary custody, and thus to gain custody of Unique. Those specific steps included, inter alia, requirements that the respondent: (1) keep all appointments set by the department; (2) participate in parenting and individual counseling sessions to address how substance abuse affected his life\n   and parenting; (3) submit to treatment programs; (4) submit to random drug testing and refrain from using drugs or abusing alcohol; (5) obtain and maintain adequate housing and legal income; (6) visit Unique as often as permitted by the department; and (7) \"[w]ithin thirty (30) days of this order, and at any time after that, tell [the department] in writing the name, address, family relationship and birth date of any person(s) who [he] would like the department to investigate and consider as a placement resource for the child(ren).\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   At the same time and pursuant to the same statute, the trial court provided specific steps to the department, ordering it, inter alia: (1) to provide the respondent with case management services\n   and referrals to treatment programs for his mental health and substance abuse issues; and (2) to \"complete the investigation and consideration of any person(s) whom the respondent has properly identified as a placement resource for the child(ren) [within thirty days of the receipt of written notice by the respondent.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After Unique and Jeramiah were removed from their mother's home, they were initially placed in emergency foster care. The following month, they were transitioned into a nonrelative, medically complex foster home under the care of Mr. and Mrs. J. In that same time frame, the department began to investigate the children's relatives in an effort to place the children with family members while they were separated from their parents. To that end, after their maternal grandparents filed a motion to intervene on February 11, 2014, the department began to investigate the possibility of placing Unique and Jeramiah in their home. Ultimately, however, the department declined to pursue such a\n   placement because the grandparents already were caring for Unique's four older siblings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On May 7, 2014, the trial court adjudicated the neglect petitions as to Unique and Jeramiah. The respondent had been duly served with the neglect petition for Unique, but he had defaulted. The court adjudged both children to be neglected and committed them to the petitioner's custody. At that time, the trial court provided the respondent with \"final specific steps,\" which it deemed necessary for him to take to address the problems that had led to the neglect adjudication, and thus to gain custody of Unique.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The following day, May 8, 2014, the department made a referral to the state of Alabama, pursuant the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children, General Statutes \u00a7 17a-175, in an effort to place Jeramiah with his paternal aunt, Cory P., a resident of Alabama whom Jeramiah's father had presented as a potential placement resource for him. Cory agreed to start adoptive parenting classes in August, 2014, but stated that she might have difficulty in obtaining the necessary medical examination due to its cost. This referral ultimately was denied by Alabama because Cory missed a filing deadline in the application process and also was unable, as she had foreseen, to obtain the necessary physical examination due to her lack of health insurance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On February 25, 2015, the petitioner filed separate termination petitions with respect to the two children. The petition for termination with respect to Unique alleged that the respondent's parental rights as to Unique should be terminated on two grounds: first, that he had failed to rehabilitate since she was adjudged to\n   be neglected; and second, that he had no ongoing parent-child relationship with her. The termination trial was scheduled for January, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   After the petitioner filed the termination petitions, but before the termination trial began, the department continued to investigate possible relative resources for the placement of Unique and Jeramiah. Among the persons it attempted to investigate for that purpose were the respondent's mother and his sister, Jennifer D. The respondent had proposed both women as possible placement resources for Unique and informed the department that the best way to reach them was by calling his mother's telephone number, which he\n   provided. Although the department attempted to contact the two women by calling them at that number, it never made contact with them because its call was not returned. The department also sought to investigate the availability and suitability of the respondent's other sister, Samantha R., to serve as a possible placement resource for Unique and Jeramiah because, at one point, she had expressed a possible interest in adopting them. The department determined, however, that Samantha was not in a suitable economic position to care for both children, and so it ceased all efforts to recruit her for that purpose. In June, 2015, several months after the petitioner had filed termination petitions as to Jeramiah and Unique, the department resumed its efforts to place them with Jeramiah's paternal aunt, Cory, in Alabama.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Through the coordinated efforts of the department and Cory's healthcare provider, she obtained the necessary medical examination for that purpose in late 2015. Thereafter, upon completing a second Interstate Compact referral, the department began the process of\n   licensing Cory as a relative foster parent. To that end, by the end of November, 2015, Cory had completed all of the necessary foster care classes, and her home had been approved as a suitable living space for the children. These promising efforts ultimately came to naught, however, when the department received a phone call from Cory on January 12, 2016, the day before the scheduled start of the termination trial, informing it that she was no longer able to care for the children. The trial commenced the following day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The trial continued on three separate days until January 27, 2016. The respondent did not attend the trial, but his counsel was present and participated fully on his behalf. Thereafter, on February 9, 2016, the trial court rendered its decision, terminating the respondent's parental rights to Unique.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In its memorandum of decision, the trial court made several findings that are relevant to this appeal. First, it provided a comprehensive review of the children's lives, describing their educational and healthcare needs and explaining how those needs were then being met by Mr. and Mrs. J., their foster parents. The court next found, inter alia, that the department had made continuous efforts to place the children with family members, although it noted specifically, with regard to the two relatives whom the respondent had proposed as possible placement resources for Unique, that \"[the department] ha[d] never been able to contact either [of them] at the phone number which he provided.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   As for the respondent, the court found that he had had \"a long history of substance abuse and mental health issues\" and that he was \"currently diagnosed with psychotic disorder, bipolar disorder and post-traumatic stress syndrome.\" The court further noted that the respondent had had no interaction with his daughter until she was more than two years old, and that his\n   later contact with her in the two years prior to trial had been sporadic.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In the adjudicatory portion of its memorandum of decision, the court first noted that the petitioner had alleged two statutory grounds for termination of the respondent's parental rights to Unique, pursuant to \u00a7 17a-112(j)(3) : (1) that Unique had \"been found in a prior proceeding to have been neglected ... and the [respondent had] failed to achieve such degree of personal\n   rehabilitation as would encourage the belief that ... [the respondent] could assume a responsible position within the life of the child;\" and (2) that \"there was no ongoing parent-child relationship\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   between the respondent and Unique.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   As for the first alleged ground for the termination of the respondent's parental rights, the court found, for the following reasons, that that ground had been established by clear and convincing evidence. The department had provided extensive services to aid the respondent in his rehabilitation. Those services had included \"parenting classes and education, both inpatient and outpatient substance abuse treatment, mental health treatment, supervised visitation and case management ....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Despite the provision of such services, the respondent continued to suffer from \"debilitating mental health and substance abuse problems\" as he had \"never successfully completed any\n   treatment program to which he [had] been referred and there [was] no reasonable prospect that he [would.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   As for the second alleged ground for the termination of the respondent's parental rights, the court also found, for the following additional reasons, that that ground had been established by clear and convincing evidence. The respondent had been incarcerated for more than half of Unique's life, and \"he [had] never cared for Unique or had to meet her needs on a day-to-day basis.\" The respondent had attended only eight of the thirty-nine visits with Unique that the department had arranged for him before he was reincarcerated in November, 2014, for violating his probation. As a result of such behavior and its consequences, a bond only recently had begun to form between the respondent and Unique, but in spite of that developing bond, Unique had come to view the respondent as \"nothing more than a visiting resource.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On the basis of the foregoing findings, the court further found, by clear and convincing evidence, that the department had made reasonable efforts to reunify the respondent with Unique, but that the respondent had failed either to rehabilitate or to establish an ongoing parent-child relationship with his daughter. The court thereupon determined that it was in Unique's best interests for the respondent's parental rights to be terminated in order to facilitate her speedy adoption. Thereafter, the respondent filed the present appeal. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On appeal, the respondent claims that the trial court erred in finding that the department had made reasonable efforts to reunify him with Unique before the petitioner initiated termination proceedings against him. More specifically, the respondent claims that the department's duty to make reasonable efforts to reunify a parent and his child, pursuant to \u00a7 17a-112(j)(1),\n   requires it to use due diligence to identify and investigate possible relative resources for the placement of the child. Because, he claims, the petitioner\n   failed to prove that the department took adequate steps to investigate his mother and sister as possible placement resources for Unique before it filed the petition to terminate his parental rights, the trial court was precluded from finding that the department made reasonable efforts to reunify him and his daughter, and thus from granting the termination petition.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   We are not persuaded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   We begin with our standard of review. The gravamen of the respondent's claim on appeal is that the trial court misapplied the statutory requirements of \u00a7 17a-112(j)(1) by failing to recognize an implicit mandatory requirement that, as part of its efforts to reunify a parent with a child, the department must conduct an adequate investigation into the availability and suitability of the parent's relatives as possible placement resources for the child. Our review of the court's interpretation of this statute is plenary.

The plain language of subsection (j) (1) does not expressly state that the department, in demonstrating that it made reasonable\n   efforts to reunify the parent and the child, must prove that it adequately investigated proposed relative placement resources for the child. Therefore, the only means by which this court can conclude that \u00a7 17a-112(j)(1) includes such an obligation, as the respondent proposes, is for this court to interpret the phrase \"reasonable efforts ... to reunify the child with the parent\" as implicitly imposing such a requirement.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=847%20A.2d%20883\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   Such an interpretation, however, is not supported by the plain language of either \u00a7 17a-112 or \u00a7 17a-111b, to which \u00a7 17a-112(j)(1) expressly refers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Although the focus of our analysis is on the language of \u00a7 17a-112(j)(1), we are mindful that the petitioner's ability to pursue the termination of parental rights is predicated on the existence of at least one of the statutory grounds for the termination of parental rights delineated in \u00a7 17a-112(j)(3). See\n   <em>\n    In re Samantha C.\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8458315\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/268/614/#p628\">\n    268 Conn. at 628\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=847%20A.2d%20883\">\n    847 A.2d 883\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, we begin our analysis by examining the plain language of \u00a7 17a-112(j)(3) and its effect on the department's efforts to reunify pursuant to \u00a7 17a-112(j)(1). Section 17a-112(j)(3) contains seven statutory grounds for terminating a parent's parental rights. These seven grounds cover a\n   range of possible deficiencies in a parent-child relationship that led to the petitioner's intervention, on behalf of the state, in order to protect the child's welfare. These grounds include, inter alia\n   <em>\n    :\n   </em>\n   abandonment of the child; physical or sexual abuse of the child by either the parent or a spouse or cohabitor; the lack of an ongoing parent-child relationship; the parent's failure to provide for the child's moral or educational well-being; or instances where the child has been previously adjudicated neglected by the court and the parent, after being \"provided specific steps to take to facilitate the return of the child ... pursuant to section 46b-129... failed to achieve such degree of personal rehabilitation as would encourage the belief that within a reasonable\n   time, considering the age and needs of the child, such parent could assume a responsible position in the life of the child ....\" General Statutes \u00a7 17a-112(j)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The statutory grounds for termination advanced by the petitioner, pursuant to subsection (j) (3), depend on the facts and circumstances presented in each case. Because \u00a7 17a-112(j) requires the petitioner to allege at least one of these statutory grounds in support of its petition to terminate the respondent's parental rights, these deficiencies in the parent-child relationship logically must exist prior to the petitioner's decision to file a petition to terminate such relationship. Consequently, it is against the backdrop of the particular deficiencies in the parent-child relationship, as alleged by the petitioner pursuant to subsection (j) (3), that the department assumes the obligation to make reasonable efforts to reunify the child with the parent pursuant to subsection (j) (1). See General Statutes \u00a7 17a-112(j)(1) through (3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   A logical reading of these provisions is that the department's efforts to reunify a particular parent and a particular child, pursuant to \u00a7 17a-112(j)(1), are dictated by the particular deficiencies in the parent-child relationship, pursuant to subsection (j) (3), which resulted in the petitioner's decision to file the petition. As such, it follows that the department's efforts to reunify a parent with a child must be intended to assist the parent to overcome the particular deficiencies alleged, pursuant to subsection (j) (3), and the reasonableness of such efforts is to be judged by determining whether such efforts would effectively assist a willing parent to overcome those deficiencies so that he or she could reassume a responsible parental role in the child's life.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Our reading of \u00a7 17a-112(j) as creating a connection between the statutory grounds alleged in support of the\n   petition to terminate parental rights and the department's duty to make reasonable efforts to reunify is further reinforced by the plain language of \u00a7 17a-111b, which is expressly referenced within the language of \u00a7 17a-112(j)(1). Notably, \u00a7 17a-111b(a) does not define \"reasonable efforts to reunify\" pursuant to \u00a7 17a-112(j)(1). Rather, \u00a7 17a-111b(a) provides that \"[t]he Commissioner of Children and Families shall make reasonable efforts to reunify a parent with a child unless the court (1) determines that such efforts are not required pursuant to subsection (b) of this section or subsection (j) of section 17a-112, or (2) has approved a permanency plan other than reunification pursuant to subsection (k) of section 46b-129.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Although the language of \u00a7 17a-111b(a) provides little guidance on the question of what constitutes \"reasonable efforts to reunify,\" the plain language of \u00a7 17a-111b(b) supports the notion that whether the department made reasonable efforts to reunify the parent with the child is based on whether the department's efforts and services could effectively assist the parent\n   in overcoming the statutory grounds advanced by the petitioner, pursuant to \u00a7 17a-112(j)(3). Section 17a-111b (b) provides in relevant part: \"The Commissioner of Children and Families ... may, at any time, file a motion with the court for a determination that reasonable efforts to reunify the parent with the child are not required.... The court may determine that such efforts are not required if the court finds upon clear and convincing evidence that [at least one of five aggravating factors exists].\" The aggravating factors listed in subsection (b) include, inter alia, instances where: the child has been abandoned; the parent has knowingly inflicted or knowingly allowed another to inflict sexual molestation or severe physical abuse upon the child; the parent has deliberately killed a sibling of the child; the parent has\n   had his or her parental rights to another child terminated within the last three years and, during the prior termination proceeding, the department made reasonable efforts to reunify the parent with the child; or where the parent has surrendered his or her infant child to the care of the state.

The flexible nature of this language allows the court to consider the conduct of both the parent and the department in addressing\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   of the seven statutory grounds contained within subsection (j) (3). This is entirely consistent with the notion that the department's efforts to reunify a parent with a child is case specific, and that the purpose of these efforts is to assist the parent in adjusting his or her\n   \"circumstances, conduct, or conditions\" in order to reassume a responsible parental role in the child's life. See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=972%20A.2d%20258\">\n    id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   On the basis of the plain language of the relevant provisions of \u00a7 17a-112 and their relationships to each other, we are able to form three conclusions. First, the interconnection among \u00a7 17a-112(j)(1) and (3), and (k) reveals a legislative intent that, in attempting to reunify the parent with the child pursuant to subsection (j) (1), the department must make reasonable efforts to assist the parent in addressing and overcoming the specific impediments preventing reunification, i.e., the statutory grounds advanced by the petitioner pursuant to subsection (j) (3). Second, by operation of the plain language of \u00a7 17a-111b(b), the department's duty to make reasonable efforts to reunify the parent with the child arises only when the parent has a reasonable prospect of overcoming the particular statutory ground for termination and, thereafter, reassuming a responsible parental role in the child's life. Third, in assessing the department's efforts to reunify a parent with a child, understood as aforesaid, an important factor to be considered is the degree to which the department complied\n   with all \"applicable\" court orders issued for that purpose. In sum, the plain language of these provisions makes clear that the court's inquiry, pursuant to \u00a7 17a-112(j) (1) and (3), is narrowly focused on the parent's willingness and ability to adjust his conduct in light of the services offered by the department and, when determining whether the department made reasonable efforts to reunify a parent with a child, the court is obligated to consider only those efforts that are designed and intended to assist the parent in overcoming the applicable statutory grounds for termination. Thus, unless there is a logical connection between the investigation of proposed placement resources and the parent's ability to overcome the deficiencies advanced in subsection (j) (3), the department would not be obligated to prove that it adequately investigated such resources as part of its burden of proving, by clear and convincing evidence, that it made reasonable efforts to reunify the parent and the child pursuant to subsection (j) (1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   There is nothing in the plain language of these provisions to support the respondent's assertion that the department's investigation into proposed temporary or permanent placement resources for the child logically assists the parent in overcoming the statutory grounds for termination delineated in \u00a7 17a-112(j)(3). Similarly, there is nothing within the plain language of either \u00a7\u00a7 17a-112, 17a-111a, or 17a-111b to support the respondent's argument that, during the termination of parental rights proceeding, the petitioner bears the burden of proving, by clear and convincing evidence, that it conducted an adequate investigation into the respondent's proposed placement resources for his daughter. Further, the court's interpretation of these statutes, pursuant to \u00a7 1-2z, does not produce an absurd or unworkable result, or one that runs counter to the purpose of these statutory provisions. Because these statutes are devoid of any language demonstrating a legislative intent that the petitioner bears the burden to prove, during the termination proceedings, that the department adequately investigated every proposed placement resource for the child, we conclude that the respondent's argument fails as a matter of statutory interpretation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The foregoing statutory analysis is further supported by our case law. Our courts have had countless opportunities to interpret the department's obligation to make \"reasonable efforts to reunify,\" pursuant to\n   \u00a7 17a-112 (j)(1), as it relates to the specific steps provided by the court during the early stages of child protection cases. In interpreting the meaning of the phrase \"reasonable efforts to reunify,\" our courts have consistently held that \"[t]he word reasonable is the linchpin on which the department's efforts in a particular set of circumstances are to be adjudged, using the clear and convincing standard of proof. Neither the word reasonable nor the word efforts is, however, defined by our legislature or by the federal act from which the requirement was drawn.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    In re Daniel C.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"124040\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/63/339/#p361\">\n    63 Conn.App. 339\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 361,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=776%20A.2d%20487\">\n    776 A.2d 487\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2001). \"[R]easonableness is an objective standard ... and whether reasonable efforts have been proven depends on the careful consideration of the circumstances of each individual case.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    In re Ebony H.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1213447\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/68/342/#p349\">\n    68 Conn.App. 342\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 349,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=789%20A.2d%201158\">\n    789 A.2d 1158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2002). \"[R]easonable efforts means doing everything reasonable, not everything possible.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    In re Daniel C.\n   </em>\n   , supra, at 361,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=776%20A.2d%20487\">\n    776 A.2d 487\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Because the test for determining whether the department made reasonable efforts to reunify a parent with a child is fact specific, factors relevant to one case may not necessarily be relevant to another case.

Consequently, neither this court nor our legislature has crafted a finite list of factors that the trial court must consider on this issue or indicated which factors, if any, should be given greater weight\n   than others when performing\n   that analysis. Rather, our courts are instructed to look to the totality of the facts and circumstances presented in each individual case.

In other words, the [department], through the specific steps issued by the court, is statutorily obligated to help the parent, if possible, regain custody of [the] child.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Citations omitted, emphasis omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    In re Devon B.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"911262\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/264/572/#p581\">\n    264 Conn. 572\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 581-82,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=825%20A.2d%20127\">\n    825 A.2d 127\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2003). On the basis of this language, we agree with the respondent, as a general matter, that the trial court's inquiry in a termination proceeding is guided by reference to any specific steps the trial court provided upon the issuance of an order of temporary custody. See General Statutes \u00a7 46b-129(b)(2).

The language of these cases supports our interpretation that the court's emphasis during the termination proceeding, pursuant to \u00a7 17a-112(j), is on the parent's willingness and ability to overcome the specific impediment preventing reunification and the department's efforts to help the parent achieve this goal; the court's emphasis is not on whether the department strictly complied with specific\n   steps that logically do not materially advance the reunification of the parent and child. It is thus clear that not every specific step that the department is ordered to take upon the issuance of an order of temporary custody is ordered for the purpose of reunifying the parent and child.

Thus, in determining whether the department made reasonable efforts to reunify the respondent with his daughter, the court was required to consider only those specific steps and efforts aimed at either of those two goals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Because the investigation of proposed placement resources for the child does not logically promote either of those two goals, we conclude that the department was not obligated to prove that it satisfied this specific step by clear and convincing evidence, and consequently that the court was not obligated to consider the degree to which the department complied with this specific step when it determined that the department made reasonable efforts to reunify the respondent with his daughter.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Even if we were to assume that the investigation of relative resources has some bearing on the issue of whether the\n   department made reasonable efforts to reunify a parent and a child, the respondent's argument would still fail because the applicable test for whether reasonable efforts were made is on the basis of the totality of the circumstances.

The respondent argues, thus, that placing a child with relatives may have provided him with additional time to address his issues with mental health and substance abuse, and thereby reduced the probability that the petitioner would have pursued the termination of his parental rights. We disagree. Not only is the question of whether the respondent made sufficient efforts to address his substance abuse and mental health issues between 2013 and 2015 entirely unrelated to the question of whether the department adequately explored all of the available placement options for Unique, but our case law demonstrates that the department's ability to place a child with his or her relatives does not control the trial court's decision of whether it is appropriate to terminate a parent's parental rights.
