On appeal, defendant argues the Family Part lacked jurisdiction to enter a final restraining order and maintains the altercation with plaintiff was not domestic violence. We reject defendant's jurisdictional challenge, noting he and plaintiff, R.G., who are brothers, fall within the amended jurisdictional provision of\n   <em>\n    N.J.S.A.\n   </em>\n   2C:25-19(d). However, we agree the facts as presented do not constitute conduct sufficient to support the entry of the order. Additionally, we address evidentiary rulings warranting reversal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   We recount the facts found in the trial testimony provided by plaintiff and defendant, along with documents admitted into evidence during the final hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Defendant and his siblings grew up in New Jersey, but he moved to Long Island, New York, approximately thirty-six years ago. His younger brother, plaintiff, and his sister remained in New Jersey and principally provided care for the parties' elderly parents. As their parents' health began to\n   fail, the bulk of responsibility fell to plaintiff, who was empowered to make decisions for each parent regarding \"physical care and treatment or to make decisions to refuse medical care and treatment.\" Plaintiff also was named the attorney-in-fact to handle his parents' affairs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In spring 2015, the parties' mother contracted pneumonia. Unfortunately, this led to medical complications. When she was discharged from the hospital, plaintiff commenced steps to place her in a skilled care facility. Defendant and his sister objected to relocating their mother from her home and away from her husband.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Soon the parties' sister was convinced their mother and father needed a level of care neither she nor her brothers could provide. Defendant, however, wanted to explore possible alternatives to keep his parents in their own home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Beginning in May 2015, defendant articulated his opposition to plaintiff's proposal to enroll his mother in a facility and later move his father to the same place. Using text messages sent to his siblings, defendant expressed his repudiation of the decisions and those who made them. Defendant testified he was making arrangements to provide care for his parents when plaintiff sent him an email stating he permanently moved their mother to the proposed facility. Defendant responded with disgust and disappointment because plaintiff failed to consider his plan to provide care for his parents in their home. The charged comments also contain defendant's desire that plaintiff suffer in his old age.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiff's email sent ten days later included instructions to defendant for visiting his parents. In part, the message was informational and, in part, condescending. It also contained directives so the parties would avoid seeing each other, apparently because defendant previously texted he did not want to see plaintiff \"or else.\" Defendant's response to plaintiff's email was crude, defensive, and angry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Also introduced at trial were copies of several text messages sent by defendant to plaintiff and his sister. However, the copies of the messages in the record do not include any prompting texts from plaintiff or plaintiff's replies; we are given only text messages sent by defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Defendant did not deny he sent the text messages, which were admitted into evidence. Their content, in part, contains coarse, gutter language and name calling. Some texts include defendant's demands for financial documents and state his intention to engage lawyers and to inform Medicare and Medicaid about his parents' assets, implying plaintiff and his sister had not been forthright in making disclosures. In a prickly and foulmouthed way, the texts convey defendant's displeasure his mother was taken from her\n   home, she was not encouraged to be mobile but mostly kept in a wheelchair, and his father was not told his wife would never return home. Further, defendant relates his belief his father was left alone, and plaintiff was ignoring defendant's calls and demands.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiff included one comment he sent, that informed defendant his calls woke their father and rhetorically added, \"you need to harass dad also?\" In response, defendant wrote:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   I luv to harass u now since u cannot speak like a man\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   It will get worse and worse\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Stand up to your brother like a man and discuss this U r making it worse U owe better to ur parents\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   There are other texts, which have none of these traits. Rather, they convey defendant's desire to provide care for his parents or reflect bitterness because of the decisions plaintiff made.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On September 5, 2015, defendant and his wife travelled to New Jersey to visit his parents, arriving at the facility in the afternoon. Plaintiff took defendant's wife aside to explain his parents' conditions and benefits provided by the facility. Plaintiff testified: \"All of a sudden [defendant] comes charging in, getting in my face in a rage.\" Defendant told his wife plaintiff was \"a liar,\" and she should not \"listen to him.\" Plaintiff's testimony recounted the exchange stating, as he spoke, defendant repeatedly held an open hand like \"a slap\" right next to plaintiff's face, or held his hand in a fist, as if he were going to hit plaintiff. The argument, where both brothers were yelling, continued in front of the facility's residents and nurses. A nurse instructed them to leave. Defendant went outside and plaintiff followed. As the argument continued, plaintiff asked defendant if he would hit him in front of their parents or whether he would \"do it [hit him] in front of a cop.\" Defendant \"shoved\" him. Plaintiff stated defendant shoved him six times, during two of which he was knocked over and his glasses fell off. Police were called and according to plaintiff, defendant was charged with simple assault.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Plaintiff responded affirmatively on direct to a series of leading questions posed by his attorney. He stated \"yes,\" when asked\n   whether he interpreted defendant's texts and conduct as posing a threat, whether the actions made him fear for his safety and well-being, and whether it caused him to fear for the safety and well-being of his family. Finally, he responded \"yes\" when asked if he believed a restraining order was necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Plaintiff could not relate any history of domestic violence between himself and defendant. He admitted their relationship was good until their mother became ill in May 2015. He then testified, plaintiff's nephew, defendant's son, obtained an order restraining defendant from contact with him and his family, two years earlier. Plaintiff went on to detail this altercation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Defendant testified. He noted plaintiff's series of text messages and emails omitted information plaintiff sent, which goaded his responses. He explained plaintiff decided he no longer wanted to care for their parents and sought a resolution to aid himself and his wife, by rejecting defendant's alternative plan to allow their parents to stay together in their own home. Defendant stated plaintiff \"got extremely pissed-off\" because defendant wanted his mother to stay in her home. Defendant mentioned he felt he was \"kicked in the teeth,\" his thoughts were \"poo-pooed,\" and he felt \"sandbagged\" by plaintiff and his sister, as they did not even consider his proposal for their parents' care. He also objected because plaintiff and his sister were not honest with his parents about what was happening. He made requests of his siblings \"two or three times\" to do small things that would make his mother's surroundings more comfortable. He believed plaintiff acted for his own benefit, not in his parents' best interests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Defendant admitted he resented plaintiff's decision to send texts rather than calling to discuss these problems, which defendant felt signaled \"a total lack of respect.\" He admitted he was \"very angry\" during the September 5, 2015 altercation, but asserted plaintiff was also yelling, showed no fear, and acted to provoke him. Plaintiff would not leave defendant alone with his parents and even followed him when he walked away. Defendant admitted he shoved plaintiff more than once, but not six times. Defendant also\n   acknowledged a restraining order, which was about to expire, was entered in New York because he slapped his adult son, though he denied injuring his son or smashing his car as plaintiff asserted.\n   At the conclusion of the testimony, the trial judge entered an oral opinion. He concluded the court had jurisdiction, even though the parties had not resided together for more than thirty years. He also concluded\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   defendant engaged in an act of harassment by telling the plaintiff on several occasions the following:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   Calling him a pompous asshole. Calling him a pompous ass wipe. \"That's at all [sic] self-righteous asses, you guys thin[k] your shit doesn't stink.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The factual support for finding defendant committed the predicate act of harassment included this cited language from one email sent by defendant to plaintiff:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   What do you think that I am not going to take care of him [their father] while he's with me. Your email sounds like you are lecturing me and telling me how to take care of him. You righteous prick. You and your wife always seem to have a better life chip on your shoulders and that your shit didn't [sic] stink. Your shit smells like mine, you asshole. You are the last one who should be lecturing, you drunk bastard. Stop the bullshit. And your family know [sic] better how to take care of dad.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The judge also recited this language from defendant's texts:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   I will tear our family apart.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   I will break you financially, morally, physically and mentally.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   On July 12\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   , \"I love to harass you since you cannot speak like a man, stand up to your brother and discuss this. It'll get worse and worse.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   On June 27\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   , \"I will come down there real soon.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   On June 13\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   , \"This is not done. I will tear our family apart. Get ready.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   And June 12\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   , \"I feel like coming to you and slapping you silly.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Finally. the judge found the September 5 shoving amounted to a simple assault.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Having concluded plaintiff proved acts of domestic violence occurred, the judge made findings on the second\n   <em>\n    Silver\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   prong, that is, whether there was immediate danger, which he stated was not \"self-evident.\" The judge relied on the alleged conduct between\n   defendant and his son, as proof of prior domestic violence, and noted defendant's escalating threats, and the parties' \"communications culminat[ed] in a physical dispute.\" Accordingly, the judge concluded plaintiff proved an immediate danger, warranting entry of a final restraining order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Defendant filed this appeal challenging the final domestic violence restraining order filed on September 17, 2015. He argues, the Family Part lacked jurisdiction to entertain plaintiff's complaint, evidence of the incident involving his son was not relevant and was erroneously considered, and the judge mistakenly found an immediate danger warranting the entry of a final domestic violence restraining order.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   Our review of a Family Part judge's findings following a bench trial is a narrow one.\n   <em>\n    Cesare v.
