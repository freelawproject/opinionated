Brattleboro Retreat\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20VT%2054\">\n    2016 VT 54\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , is withdrawn and replaced by an amended opinion,\n   <em>\n    Kuligoski v. Brattleboro Retreat\n   </em>\n   , 2016 VT 54A. The State of Vermont's motion to file for reargument as amicus curiae is granted. Appellees' and amici curiaes' motions for reargument are denied.\n  </p>\n  <opinion id=\"p-14\">\n   REIBER, C.J. and SKOGLUND, J., dissenting.\n  </opinion>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   After this opinion first issued in May 2016, the Court received an astonishing number of motions for reargument-from the parties, amici, and not least the State of Vermont, Agency of Human Services-urging the majority to reconsider its decision to impose a new, ill-defined, and unprecedented duty of care on mental health care providers in the State of Vermont.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The State's motion is especially noteworthy because it represents neither a party to the case nor one of the many amicus curiae invested in its outcome, but rather the broader interests of health care patients and their families statewide. The State's clear and dispassionate analysis of both the immediate and long term damage resulting from the majority's misguided judgment is essential reading for anyone interested in the subject. While far too nuanced to summarize adequately, the State's view is captured in its introduction, which is well worth quoting in full:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Court's May 6, 2016 decision imposes on mental health care providers a \"duty of care to provide sufficient information\" to a patient's \"caretakers\" so those individuals can \"fully assume their caretaker responsibilities to assist [the patient] and protect against any harmful conduct in which he might engage.\" The ambiguous scope of this new duty creates the very real risk that providers-facing uncertain liabilities and potentially conflicting legal obligations\n   -will err on the side of providing treatment in more restrictive settings and making more requests for involuntary treatment. The ruling thus has immediate and potentially far-reaching consequences for Vermont's system of care. It may also deter family members and others from helping to care for those with mental illness.... The Court should vacate the opinion and reconsider its decision to adopt this novel duty of care.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Unfortunately, although the majority has made changes to \"narrow\" its holding, the changes are entirely inadequate to address the harm identified by the State: the majority's failure to recognize that it has created and imposed on mental health care providers a duty so ill-defined and uninformed that even the best, and the best-intentioned, providers will be confused and conflicted as to their professional obligations. Ironically, although the majority clearly believes that its decision represents progressive thinking, it is at odds with the real interests of Vermont's health care providers, patients, and the public at large. The State is correct; the Court should grant the several motions for reargument, vacate its decision, and reject this novel duty.\n  </p>\n  <p type=\"majority\">\n   <author id=\"p-19\">\n    DOOLEY, J.\n   </author>\n   <p id=\"p-20\">\n    \u00b6 1. This case arises out of the assault of Michael Kuligoski by a former Brattleboro Retreat patient, E.R., after the patient was discharged from the Retreat, a mental health treatment facility, and while he was undergoing outpatient treatment with Northeast Kingdom Human Services (NKHS). Plaintiff Carole Kuligoski, individually and on behalf of Michael, Mark Kuligoski, and James Kuligoski (collectively plaintiffs), filed suit in Windham Superior Court against defendants Brattleboro Retreat and NKHS, raising claims of failure to warn of E.R.'s danger to others, failure to train E.R.'s parents in handling E.R., failure to treat, improper release, and negligent undertaking. The superior court granted defendants' motions to dismiss for failure to state a claim, and plaintiffs appealed. We reverse on the failure to warn claim, and affirm on the failure to treat, improper release, failure to train, and negligent undertaking claims.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-21\">\n    \u00b6 2. Plaintiffs' complaint alleges the following facts,\n    <footnotemark>\n     1\n    </footnotemark>\n    as relevant to this appeal. On October 9, 2010, E.R. was voluntarily admitted to the Psychiatric Department at Central Vermont Medical Center (CVMC) with a \"psychotic disorder\" after having threatened young children in his home. During his first few days at CVMC, E.R. was easily agitated, made threatening remarks, reported auditory hallucinations, and had fair-to-poor judgment. The examining physician tentatively diagnosed E.R. with a schizophreniform disorder.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-22\">\n    \u00b6 3. On October 15, 2010, the medical professionals at CVMC completed the necessary documents to have E.R. involuntarily committed. The documents stated that he was mentally ill, posed a danger to himself and others, and was in need of involuntary hospitalization. The following day, E.R. was placed in restraints and transferred from CVMC to the Vermont State Hospital where a physician examined him and determined that he was a danger\n    to others and, if released, would pose a danger to his family. There is no indication that either the documents prepared at CVMC or the determination of the physician at the Vermont State Hospital were ever used to start a formal involuntary commitment proceeding. Nor is there an explanation of the basis on which E.R. continued to be held at the Vermont State Hospital. We can conclude only that E.R. must have been held as a voluntary patient.\n    <footnotemark>\n     2\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-23\">\n    \u00b6 4. While at the Vermont State Hospital, E.R. was administered anti-psychotic and anxiety medication. He repeatedly asked to leave the hospital, once tried to escape, threatened to punch out a window, and, although he denied having auditory hallucinations, was observed reacting to unseen stimuli. After E.R. reported feeling unsafe at the hospital, a social worker made a referral for his transfer to the Retreat, a nonprofit psychiatric hospital in Windham County, Vermont. Upon his discharge from the state hospital, he was diagnosed with schizophreniform disorder.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-24\">\n    \u00b6 5. On October 22, 2010, E.R. was examined by a physician at the Retreat who confirmed the state hospital's diagnosis. The physician reported that E.R. \"had verbalized homicidal ideation toward staff.\" E.R. was thereafter placed on a staff-intensive treatment plan but continued to exhibit \"grossly psychotic\" behavior, lack of insight, and severely impaired judgment. His physician noted that he \"required an in-patient level of care to prevent further decompensation.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     3\n    </footnotemark>\n    Further reports indicate auditory and visual hallucinations, menacing behavior, and homicidal and suicidal ideation.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-25\">\n    \u00b6 6. On November 1, 2010, E.R.'s physician noted that \"E.R. continued to be floridly psychotic, probably paranoid, guarded and gradually improving but that he remained sufficiently ill that he totally lacked insight into his illness and that E.R. would be non-compliant with treatment outside of the hospital.\" He further noted that E.R. would remain on the treatment plan and be allowed out only for brief intervals.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-26\">\n    \u00b6 7. During his time at the Retreat, E.R.'s behavior did not improve. In his November 10, 2010 assessment, E.R.'s physician stated that, if discharged, E.R. would be a high risk for decompensation, might stop his medication, and might not participate in aftercare treatment. Nevertheless, he stated that E.R. would be discharged on November 12.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-27\">\n    \u00b6 8. On November 12, 2010, E.R.'s physician noted that he stopped taking his medication and had been hearing voices commanding him to kill himself. E.R. said of\n    the commands, \"I feel like I should do it.\" His physician wrote in his assessment, \"Obviously [E.R.'s] refusal of medications is very worrisome and exactly what this writer was concerned about. Not only abstractly is it a bad idea, but he actually seems to have experienced an increase in his voices with only missing one night's medications.\" E.R. was, however, discharged that same day.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-28\">\n    \u00b6 9. Throughout the period of his treatment at both the Vermont State Hospital and the Retreat, E.R. was closely monitored by his parents, with whom he had been living. Exactly what the parents were told at the time of discharge is disputed, although it appears they were told that E.R. \"might have schizophrenia.\" They understood that E.R. was \"going through a phase and would recover.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-29\">\n    \u00b6 10. In the discharge summary, E.R.'s physician again stated that E.R. was a high risk for poor compliance with post-discharge treatment; E.R. had been diagnosed as having a \"psychotic disorder, not otherwise specified\"; and that E.R.'s parents believed his mental health was related to his breakup with a girlfriend in 2009 or possibly a sequela resulting from mononucleosis. He stated that E.R. met the criteria for schizophrenia or, at the very least, schizophreniform disorder.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    \u00b6 11. Prior to E.R.'s discharge, the Retreat developed an aftercare treatment plan with E.R.'s parents that involved regular visits to NKHS. E.R. was also prescribed daily medication, which his mother was told to administer to him. E.R.'s mother believed that E.R.'s condition had considerably improved at the time of his release.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    \u00b6 12. On December 1, 2010, E.R. met with a treatment team at NKHS and signed a cognitive remediation therapy plan. A week later, a member of the treatment team completed a Substance Abuse Addendum, in which he stated \"that E.R. was a high risk for Dimension 3 of the Client Placement Criteria (emotional, behavioral or cognitive conditions/complications) because E.R. had recently been diagnosed with a psychotic disorder and had minimal insight surrounding the diagnosis.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-32\">\n    \u00b6 13. In mid-December, E.R. told his mother that he had stopped taking his medication. She called NKHS and spoke with one of the physicians on E.R.'s treatment team. The physician told E.R.'s mother that this was a cause for concern but that E.R. had to decide to take care of himself. E.R. did not meet with anyone at NKHS between mid-December 2010 and March 2011, and no one at NKHS reached out to E.R. during that time or took any action with respect to E.R.'s medication regime.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    \u00b6 14. On February 26, 2011, E.R. accompanied his father to an apartment building in St. Johnsbury owned by E.R.'s grandparents. Plaintiff Michael Kuligoski was also at the apartment building, working on the furnace. E.R. went down to the basement where Mr. Kuligoski was working and assaulted him, causing serious injuries. The forensic psychiatrist who evaluated E.R. at the request of the criminal court stated that the night before the offense E.R. had not slept well, awoke early that morning, was just \"sitting and staring,\" and was paranoid that people were staring at him en route to the apartment. The psychiatrist believed that E.R. likely was in a \"psychotic haze\" at the time of the offense, having been \"overcome by the symptoms of his condition to the degree where he acted while in a psychotic storm.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    \u00b6 15. Plaintiffs filed a complaint in superior court, alleging seven counts: (1) the Retreat was negligent in discharging E.R.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    knowing of his dangerous tendencies and that he was a high risk for decompensation; (2) the Retreat was negligent in failing to warn E.R.'s parents that he posed a risk to the general public; (3) the Retreat was negligent in failing to train E.R.'s parents how to supervise him, monitor and manage his medications, and take necessary and appropriate measures to protect potential victims; (4) the Retreat was negligent in its undertaking \"to render a service that it recognized or should have recognized as necessary for the protection of third persons\"; (5) NKHS was negligent in failing to warn E.R.'s parents that he posed a risk to the general public; (6) NKHS was negligent in failing to take \"immediate and affirmative steps\" to treat E.R.; and (7) NKHS was negligent in undertaking its duty to render services to E.R. Although the complaint itemized separate counts, plaintiffs emphasized in the superior court, as well as in this Court, that the counts were based on a common \"duty of reasonable care to act to avoid needless risk to the safety of third parties\" based on the \"special relationship\" that existed between the Retreat and NKHS and their patient, E.R.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    \u00b6 16. Defendants moved to dismiss the respective claims against them, pursuant to Vermont Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). They both argued that they owed no duty to protect plaintiffs from attack by E.R. and that their alleged negligence was not the proximate cause of plaintiffs' injuries. The superior court granted both motions. Relying largely on our decision in\n    <em>\n     Peck v. Counseling Service of Addison County, Inc.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4754951\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/146/61/\">\n     146 Vt. 61\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4754951\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/146/61/\">\n     499 A.2d 422\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1985), the superior court concluded that defendants owed no duty to plaintiffs because Michael Kuligoski was not an identifiable victim and defendants were under no duty to control E.R. With respect to the third-party duty, the court explained that plaintiffs' claims \"would push the ruling by the\n    <em>\n     Peck\n    </em>\n    majority far beyond the bounds of the holding as limited by the facts there, and the recognition of those claims would stake out expansive new territory not warranted by proper respect for the separation of powers.\" As to the duty of defendants to control E.R., the court emphasized Vermont's \"policy of keeping mentally-ill persons in the least restrictive environment possible.\" This appeal followed.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    \u00b6 17. On appeal, plaintiffs generally argue that the superior court erred in holding that\n    <em>\n     Peck\n    </em>\n    barred its claims. They contend that, while\n    <em>\n     Peck\n    </em>\n    involved an identifiable victim, its holding should not be read as limiting its reach\n    <em>\n     only\n    </em>\n    to identifiable victims. They argue that this reading is supported by public policy protecting the public from dangerous individuals and is consistent with modern tort scholarship, such as the Restatement (Third) of Torts: Liability for Physical and Emotional Harm \u00a7 41 (2012). Plaintiffs argue that the trial court erred in concluding at this stage of the case that there was no proximate cause. As we explain in our discussion below, we hold that\n    <em>\n     Peck\n    </em>\n    and other precedents bar plaintiffs' duty-to-treat and negligent-undertaking claims. However, we also hold that\n    <em>\n     Peck\n    </em>\n    extends to identifiable and\n    <em>\n     foreseeable\n    </em>\n    victims, and that plaintiffs' duty-to-warn claims should not be dismissed at this stage in the litigation.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    \u00b6 18. We review the superior court's decision \"on a motion to dismiss de novo under the same standard as the trial court and will uphold a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim only if it is beyond doubt that there exist no facts or circumstances that would entitle the plaintiff to relief.\"\n    <em>\n     Birchwood Land Co. v.

Once a legal duty is established, as well as breach of that duty, there must be factual causation for the defendant to be subject to liability for the harm caused to the plaintiff. See\n    <em>\n     id\n    </em>\n    .

Before addressing the specific issues, we start with a discussion of the duty to third parties generally, as well as the specific duty of mental health professionals to their patients and nonpatient third parties. In doing so, we note that the main issues in this case do not arise from a dispute as to whether defendants had a general duty of care, or even whether that duty extends to nonpatients in appropriate circumstances, but rather to the specific elements of that duty. Thus, we are starting at the most general level where there is only limited disagreement between the parties, and moving to more specific levels where the sharp disagreement emerges. As we have repeatedly stated, background principles of negligence provide that \"duty is not sacrosanct in itself, but only 'an expression of the sum total of those considerations of policy which lead the law to say that the plaintiff is entitled to protection.' \"\n    <em>\n     Sorge\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"370017\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/171/171/#p174\">\n     171 Vt. at 177\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"370017\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/171/171/#p174\">\n     762 A.2d at 820\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (quoting W.

Comment g to \u00a7 41 of the Third Restatement addresses the duty of mental health professionals to third parties. The duty begins with the physician using \"customary care\" to determine whether a patient poses a risk of harm to others. \"Once\n    such a patient is identified, the duty imposed by reasonable care depends on the circumstances\" and \"may require providing appropriate treatment, warning others of the risks posed by the patient, seeking the patient's agreement to a voluntary commitment, making efforts to commit the patient involuntarily, or taking other steps to ameliorate the risk posed by the patient.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"370017\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/171/171/#p174\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    Although courts have been hesitant to embrace duties any broader than those to \"reasonably identified\" victims, \u00a7 41 sets no express limit on individuals to whom the duty is owed.

The Duty to Warn\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    \u00b6 35. Having set out the nature of duties for tort actions and the important sources of law for defining the duties of mental health professionals to third parties injured by their patients, we look at the specific duties alleged in plaintiffs' complaint in this case. As we stated above, the positions of the parties begin to differ when we look at the specific duties alleged. The decisions from around the country reflect these differences. Although the central holding of\n    <em>\n     Tarasoff\n    </em>\n    has been widely accepted around the country, the same is not true for extensions of the duty beyond providing warnings. Further, courts in other jurisdictions are divided on how far to extend the\n    <em>\n     Tarasoff\n    </em>\n    duty to warn, and the subsequent limitation on that duty expressed in\n    <em>\n     Thompson\n    </em>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    \u00b6 36. We first consider plaintiffs' allegations that defendant, Brattleboro Retreat, breached its duties to warn E.R.'s parents of the risk of his dangerous behavior and to train them in how to handle him. In examining the duty of defendant, we put these claims together under the general description of duty to warn and consider later whether separate duties are involved.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    Courts differ when evaluating a claim of a duty to warn someone other than an identified victim. As discussed previously, several courts have limited the duty to identifiable victims, or a class of individuals whose injury is foreseeable because of their relationship or proximity to a specifically identifiable victim. See, e.g.,\n    <em>\n     Dawe v. Dr. Reuven Bar - Levav &amp; Assocs., P.C.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4093369\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mich/485/20/\">\n     485 Mich. 20\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=780%20N.W.2d%20272\">\n     780 N.W.2d 272\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 278 (2010) (establishing duty to warn for mental health professionals when patient makes threat of violence against \"reasonably identifiable third person\" and has apparent intent and ability to carry out threat);\n    <em>\n     Emerich v.

The reasoning is much the same in these decisions, as they reflect the policies set forth by the California Supreme Court in\n    <em>\n     Thompson\n    </em>\n    . See, e.g.,\n    <em>\n     Fraser v. United States\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"392542\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/236/625/\">\n     236 Conn. 625\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=674%20A.2d%20811\">\n     674 A.2d 811\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 816 (1996) (stating that \"the interests of the mental health profession in honoring the confidentiality of the patient-therapist relationship and in respecting the humanitarian and due process concerns that limit the involuntary hospitalization of the mentally ill\" counsel against imposing \"liability for harm to unidentifiable victims or unidentifiable classes of victims\" (citations omitted)). Many of these courts also rely on their existing precedent in the area of negligence, citing the limitations on third-party liability already recognized in their common law.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=674%20A.2d%20811\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=674%20A.2d%20811\">\n     at 815-16\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (observing that scope of liability in negligence to injured third parties has not been enlarged by changes in tort law).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    \u00b6 37. However, several other courts have held that a duty to warn is owed not only to specifically identified or identifiable victims, but to\n    <em>\n     foreseeable\n    </em>\n    victims or to those whose membership in a particular class-for example, those living with the patient-places them within a zone of danger.

Plaintiffs ask that we construe\n    <em>\n     Peck\n    </em>\n    broadly to find that E.R.'s parents should have been warned of his propensities in order to protect third parties. Defendants, on the other hand, focus on the language in our holding that specifies an \"identifiable victim,\" a factor absent here. They argue that\n    <em>\n     Peck\n    </em>\n    is specifically limited to the circumstance where there is an identifiable victim and should be interpreted to hold that there is no duty to warn in the absence of such a victim. We note that none of our more recent cases have expanded the duty articulated in\n    <em>\n     Peck\n    </em>\n    to unforeseeable victims. Nevertheless, we agree with plaintiffs that the specific liability holding of\n    <em>\n     Peck\n    </em>\n    is based on the facts and circumstances that were before the Court. Thus, while\n    <em>\n     Peck\n    </em>\n    finds a duty to\n    warn an identifiable victim, it does not hold that liability is limited to those circumstances and in fact draws on public health cases where there is no identified victim.\n    <footnotemark>\n     5\n    </footnotemark>\n    In saying this, we are also cognizant of the fact that\n    <em>\n     Peck\n    </em>\n    was decided thirty years ago, before modern trends in this area, such as the Restatement (Third) of Torts \u00a7 41.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    \u00b6 39.

The dissent asserts here that a holding that the duty to warn extends beyond the identified victim represents an unacknowledged minority position. We reject that assertion because it is not true.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    \u00b6 41. We agree that the\n    <em>\n     Peck\n    </em>\n    holding does not apply to a duty to warn the general public. The complaint here expresses a much narrower duty: to warn\n    E.R.'s caretakers, here, his parents. It alleges that the warnings would have informed them such that they could have properly supervised E.R. Any warning to E.R.'s parents would not have been predicated on their membership in the public at large, however, and would have been predicated on their assumption of custody and caretaking responsibilities of E.R., even though an adult, from the Retreat. For two reasons, which circumscribe the scope of the duty we now recognize, we conclude that the Retreat had a duty to give such warnings.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    \u00b6 42. The first reason involves the unique circumstances of this case. The complaint alleges that the parents had assumed the role of E.R.'s caretakers even though he was an adult. The extended record shows that the parents were directly involved in E.R.'s care and treatment from the first time that he showed symptoms of mental illness and were involved in controlling his conduct. This meant that they had assumed responsibilities, the discharge of which could be affected by the information they received. For example, the limited facts indicate that in a discharge conference, Retreat staff told E.R.'s mother that she should give E.R. his medication, but also indicate that E.R. stopped taking medication on his own after discharge. A complete warning of the effect of E.R. discontinuing the medication may have affected the parents' degree of involvement in ensuring E.R. took his medication.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    \u00b6 43. Because the parents were monitoring E.R.'s needs and treatment, and were involved in his discharge, they were available to receive information on his continuing need for treatment and the actions that should have been taken based on his behavior. In fact, the complaint alleges that the Retreat's mental health professional, who was aware of the risk that E.R. would suffer decompensation and stop his medications if discharged, had \"discussed discharge with E.R.'s mother\" before determining such a course was possible. Moreover, before the discharge, the Retreat made an aftercare treatment plan \"with E.R.\n    <em>\n     and his parents\n    </em>\n    .\" The complaint thus supports an inference that if E.R. had not had parents into whose care he could be released, parents who could monitor his symptoms and medication intake, Brattleboro Retreat would not have authorized his release.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    \u00b6 44. Again, we emphasize that we are dealing with a case that was dismissed on the pleadings with no factual development.\n    <footnotemark>\n     6\n    </footnotemark>\n    We conclude that by transferring custody of a patient with a psychotic disorder to caretakers whom they knew lacked psychiatric training and experience, the Retreat owed a duty of care to provide reasonable information to the parents to enable them to recognize the dangers and fulfill the responsibilities envisioned for them in the treatment plan. In adopting this duty definition, we are relying upon\n    <em>\n     Peck\n    </em>\n    , as well as precedents from other jurisdictions and the Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7\u00a7 315 and 319. Although we have discussed it above for background, we have not adopted and relied upon \u00a7 41(b)(4) of the Restatement (Third) of Torts. We recognize\n    that there are contrary decisions from some of our sister states, but generally we find them distinguishable. For example, in\n    <em>\n     In re Estate of Votteler\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10677748\" index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/327/759/#p760\">\n     327 N.W.2d 759\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 760 (Iowa 1982), the plaintiff was injured when a patient suffering from a serious mental illness ran over her with a car. The plaintiff alleged that the patient's psychiatrist was negligent in failing to warn the patient's husband, a friend of the plaintiff, of the danger the patient presented to the public \"so he could have protected [the] plaintiff.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10677748\" index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/327/759/#p760\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    In its ruling, the Iowa Supreme Court held that the\n    <em>\n     Tarasoff\n    </em>\n    rule could not be \"stretched\" to support finding a cause of action against a psychiatrist in these circumstances, as such a theory would \"attenuate[ ] the\n    <em>\n     Tarasoff\n    </em>\n    rule beyond the breaking point.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10677748\" index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/327/759/#p760\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10677748\" index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/327/759/#p760\">\n     at 761-62\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . However, the decision was based on the particular facts of the case. Unlike in\n    <em>\n     Tarasoff\n    </em>\n    , the record \"lack[ed] any basis for finding the therapist knew of the danger\" the patient presented,\n    <em>\n     id\n    </em>\n    . at 762, but instead, contained overwhelming evidence to suggest the plaintiff was herself well aware of the patient's violent propensities; indeed, the patient had told the plaintiff on multiple occasions that \"she would kill her.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10677748\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/327/759/#p760\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10677748\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/327/759/#p760\">\n     at 761\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    \u00b6 45. By contrast, the complaint here is replete with allegations that staff members at the Retreat were well aware of E.R.'s capacity for violence. Upon his admission at the Retreat, E.R.'s records from the Vermont State Hospital were reviewed, including the findings by his intake physician that E.R. was \"clearly a danger to others\" and would be a \"danger to his own family\" if released. He verbalized \"homicidal ideation\" toward staff only nine days after his admission to the Retreat, and throughout his stay, continued to have auditory hallucinations which commanded him to kill himself or others. E.R.'s behavior was so aggressive that his psychiatrist adopted an Alternative Low Stimulation Area (ALSA) treatment plan, which involves \"placing patients who are verbalizing or demonstrating they are unsafe in a special area\" that is staff-intensive and free from any objects that can be used to harm the self or others. Indeed, it appears from the complaint that E.R. was kept in ALSA for all but the first nine days of his stay at the Retreat.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    \u00b6 46. Because the case never went beyond the complaint stage, there is no allegation that the parents were aware of E.R.'s risk of danger such that they could be charged with \"knowledge of the danger as a matter of law\" sufficient to nullify any duty to warn.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10677748\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/327/759/#p760\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10677748\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/327/759/#p760\">\n     at 762\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The expanded record shows that the state of the parents' knowledge is strongly disputed.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    \u00b6 47. A second reason for finding a duty to warn in this case is that E.R.'s parents fell within the \"zone of danger\" from E.R.'s conduct. While there is no allegation that E.R. ever threatened his parents, plaintiffs' complaint alleged that by failing to warn the parents, the \"Brattleboro Retreat needlessly endangered the safety of third parties, including, not limited to the Plaintiffs.\" Moreover, it is alleged that E.R. specifically threatened his caretakers, and the parents were to become his caretakers after his discharge from the Retreat.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    \u00b6 48. The duty to warn those in the zone of danger was addressed by the Arizona Supreme Court in a case very similar to this one. See\n    <em>\n     Hamman v. Cty. of Maricopa\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1482207\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/161/58/\">\n     161 Ariz. 58\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1482207\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/161/58/\">\n     775 P.2d 1122\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1123 (1989). In\n    <em>\n     Hamman\n    </em>\n    , the patient was brought to an emergency psychiatric center because of violent and other \"abnormal behavior.\" His parents expressed fear that he \"would either be killed or kill somebody\" and reported that they maintained constant supervision over him.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1482207\" index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/161/58/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    After speaking with a doctor, the doctor refused to admit the patient to the hospital, but prescribed\n    medication and advised his mother to take him to follow-up care at a medical center.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 1124. One morning, the patient refused to take his medicine. Later that day, he attacked his father with an electric drill.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    \u00b6 49. The parents filed a claim against the hospital for negligence, claiming that the doctor owed them a duty to reasonably diagnose and treat their son's condition and that they reasonably relied upon the doctor's advice that their son was harmless. In assessing the scope of the duty, the court rejected the narrow approach of requiring an identifiable victim but also cautioned against adopting a rule that is \"too inclusive, subjecting psychiatrists to an unreasonably wide range of potential liability.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 1127. The court concluded:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n    If indeed [the doctor] negligently diagnosed [the patient] as harmless, the most likely affected victims would be [his parents].\n    <em>\n     Their constant physical proximity to [the patient] placed them in an obvious zone of danger\n    </em>\n    . [His parents] were readily identifiable persons who might suffer harm if the psychiatrist was negligent in the diagnosis or treatment of the patient. The fact that [the patient] never verbalized any specific threats against [his parents] does not change the circumstances that, even without such threats, the most likely victims of the patient's violent reaction would be [his parents].\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 1128 (emphasis added); see also\n    <em>\n     Div. of Corr. v. Neakok\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10417057\" index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/721/1121/\">\n     721 P.2d 1121\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (Alaska 1986),\n    <em>\n     overruled on other grounds by State v. Cowles\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8331917\" index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/151/353/\">\n     151 P.3d 353\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (Alaska 2006) (finding that state agencies had duty to warn residents of small community of parolee's dangerous propensities, particularly victims, as one was foreseeable and others were in zone of danger). We find\n    <em>\n     Hamman\n    </em>\n    persuasive and follow its reasoning.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    \u00b6 50. In recognizing a duty to warn, we distinguish this case from\n    <em>\n     Thompson\n    </em>\n    , where the mother of the juvenile offender was not foreseeably endangered, as the offender's threats were to children. By contrast, E.R.'s parents were in the zone of danger, as E.R.'s dangerous propensities were not targeted towards any one class of individuals. If E.R. had harmed his parents, we may have easily concluded that the Retreat owed them a duty to warn of his violent tendencies; if he directed violence towards a member of the general public, the question becomes harder. If defendant owed a duty to the parents and breached that duty, resulting in harm to an unidentifiable third party, is defendant liable?\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-88\">\n    \u00b6 51. To answer this question, we look to cases involving a physician's duty to warn a patient, the breach of which results in injury to a third party. Most courts have recognized that physicians owe a duty to their patients to warn them about the hazards of driving on certain medications and that, when the physician breaches that duty, causing harm to a third party, he or she is liable for that failure to warn. See, e.g.,\n    <em>\n     Taylor v. Smith\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9031730\" index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/892/887/#p893\">\n     892 So.2d 887\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 893-94, 897 (Ala.2004) (holding that duty of care owed by physician to his patient \"extends to third-party motorists who are injured in a foreseeable automobile accident with the patient that results from the [physician's] administration of methadone\" and citing cases from Maine, Michigan, New Mexico, Oregon, Texas, and Wisconsin that have imposed similar duty to warn); see also Restatement (Third) of Torts \u00a7 41 cmt. h. But see\n    <em>\n     Jarmie v. Troncale\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=306%20Conn.%20578\">\n     306 Conn. 578\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20A.3d%20802\">\n     50 A.3d 802\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 810 (2012) (holding that physicians owe no duty to warn patients not to drive for benefit of third parties because \"Connecticut precedent does not support it, the plaintiff was an unidentifiable victim, public policy considerations counsel against it, and there is no consensus among courts in other jurisdictions,\n    which have considered the issue only rarely\"). We conclude, based on existing precedent and modern trends in negligence law, that the Retreat had a duty to warn E.R.'s parents as individuals in the \"zone of danger\" of E.R.'s dangerous propensities.\n    <footnotemark>\n     7\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    \u00b6 52. This duty on which we base this decision is a narrow one, and applies only when a caregiver is actively engaging with the patient's provider in connection with the patient's care or the patient's treatment plan (or in this case discharge plan), the provider substantially relies on that caregiver's ongoing participation, and the caregiver is himself or herself within the zone of danger of the patient's violent propensities.\n    <footnotemark>\n     8\n    </footnotemark>\n    It does not require health care providers to seek out a caretaker for the patient to whom they can impart this information; nor does it require physicians to make disclosures to family members or others who may live with the patient but are not engaged with the patient's treatment and are not factored into the patient's treatment plan.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-90\">\n    \u00b6 53. As we noted above, plaintiffs' complaint alleges two separate duties-a duty to warn and a duty to train. The complaint described the duty to warn as a duty to inform E.R.'s parents that \"he posed a risk to the public including themselves.\" It described the duty to train as the duty to instruct the parents \"to supervise him, how to monitor and manage his medications intake, to effectively recognize when medications were being avoided and to effectively respond so that measures necessary and appropriate to protect potential victims could be implemented.\" The duty to warn as we have described it above contemplates more than simply advising the parents that their son posed a risk; it may also entail a duty to provide reasonable information to enable the parents to fulfill the role envisioned for them in the treatment plan to help keep their son safe. The specific nature and content of that information is case-specific, and a question of fact. In that sense, the duty to \"warn\" may be better described as a duty to \"inform\" that incorporates some elements of what plaintiffs describe as a distinct duty to \"train.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-91\">\n    \u00b6 54. However, we find the amorphous concept of a \"duty to train\" as a distinct cause of action unworkable, and note that such a duty, in contrast to the duty to warn as we have described it, lacks grounding in existing caselaw. For these reasons, we decline to recognize a distinct cause of action for failure to \"train\" E.R.'s parents.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    \u00b6 55. We have initially analyzed the duty to inform with respect to the Retreat. Plaintiffs' complaint alleges a similar duty to warn with respect to NKHS. Although the two entities had different responsibilities, we see no reason to differentiate between them in defining the duty that each owed. Thus, we hold that NKHS had the same duty to warn, recast above as including a duty to provide particular information, as the Retreat did.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-93\">\n    \u00b6 56. As we discussed briefly above, defendants also allege that plaintiffs' duty-to-inform counts should be dismissed because plaintiffs cannot show the element of causation. Duty is a legal question,\n    and is therefore appropriate for our consideration on an appeal from a motion to dismiss. We cannot say the same about the element of causation. Until there is factual development on the extent to which defendants may have fallen short of their duty, if any, and were negligent in doing so, we cannot determine whether plaintiffs can meet their burden of showing that defendants' negligence was a proximate cause of plaintiffs' damages. We cannot dismiss the complaint based on the absence of causation.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-94\">\n    \u00b6 57. Finally, as to the duty to warn or inform, we must address the confidentiality arguments raised in the briefs of defendant NKHS and amici curiae Vermont Council of Developmental and Mental Health Services, Inc., Disability Rights of Vermont, Inc., and the Vermont Association of Hospitals and Health Systems. Defendant NKHS and amici curiae argue that expansion of the standards under which psychotherapists must disclose protected health information without consent beyond those imposed in\n    <em>\n     Peck\n    </em>\n    violates state and federal law and contrary to policy goals of encouraging individuals to seek mental health treatment. In particular, defendant and amici curiae note that Vermont has codified the physician-patient privilege in 12 V.S.A. \u00a7 1612(a), which precludes the disclosure of confidential information absent patient permission or authorization from an express provision of law. Amici curiae argue that while\n    <em>\n     Peck\n    </em>\n    modified \u00a7 1612 to require disclosure when a mental patient has threatened \"serious harm to an identified victim,\"\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4754951\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/146/61/\">\n     146 Vt. at 67\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4754951\" index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/146/61/\">\n     499 A.2d at 426\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , no express provision of Vermont or federal law permits disclosure under the broad terms of Restatement (Third) of Torts \u00a7 41(a)-also urged by plaintiffs-when a patient poses \"risks\" to the safety of the public at large.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-95\">\n    \u00b6 58. Amici curiae also note that other Vermont statutes, particularly 18 V.S.A. \u00a7 1852(a)(7) and \u00a7 7103, protect from disclosure clinical information identifying current or former hospital patients. See\n    <em>\n     id\n    </em>\n    . \u00a7 7103(a) (\"All certificates, applications, records, and reports ... directly or indirectly identifying ... an individual whose hospitalization or care has been sought or provided under this part, together with clinical information relating to such persons shall be kept confidential and shall not be disclosed by any person\");\n    <em>\n     id\n    </em>\n    . \u00a7 1852(a)(7) (\"The patient has the right to expect that all communications and records pertaining to his or her care shall be treated as confidential. Only medical personnel, or individuals under the supervision of medical personnel, directly treating the patient, or those persons monitoring the quality of that treatment ... shall have access to the patient's medical records.\"). Finally, amici curiae suggest that an expansion of the duty to warn would violate the confidentiality provisions established in the Privacy Rule adopted pursuant to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1320d et seq., which applies to the information acquired by community mental health agencies across the United States and which is exempt from any public policy exception created by this Court.\n    <footnotemark>\n     9\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-96\">\n    \u00b6 59. We recognize that although defendants and amici have accepted\n    <em>\n     Peck\n    </em>\n    's disclosure requirements as a baseline beyond which we cannot go, that decision gave very limited consideration to binding confidentiality requirements. The\n    <em>\n     Peck\n    </em>\n    Court noted that the Legislature had created certain exceptions to the statutory patient's privilege and that an exception similar to that sought for mental health professionals to warn identified potential victims existed for lawyers and, consequently, created by judicial decision an exemption for mental health professionals.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4754951\" index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/146/61/\">\n     146 Vt. at 67-68\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4754951\" index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/146/61/\">\n     499 A.2d at 426\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . To ensure that the disclosure requirements we have adopted fully comply with confidentiality requirements, we are reexamining the issue here rather than relying upon\n    <em>\n     Peck\n    </em>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-97\">\n    \u00b6 60. Our conclusion is that the aforementioned statutes and regulations do not bar plaintiffs' failure-to-inform cause of action in this case for three reasons. First, while it is true that 12 V.S.A. \u00a7 1612 and the more comprehensive Vermont Rule of Evidence 503 prevent physicians from disclosing health information or history, the statute codifies an evidentiary privilege, thus limiting its application to judicial proceedings. See\n    <em>\n     Steinb e rg v. Jensen\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11917497\" index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/194/439/\">\n     194 Wis.2d 439\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11917497\" index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/194/439/\">\n     534 N.W.2d 361\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 370 (1995) (\"The physician-patient privilege is a testimonial rule of evidence, not a substantive rule of law regulating the conduct of physicians.\"). As such, the privilege does not preclude the Retreat from warning E.R.'s parents of E.R.'s likelihood of violent actions.\n    <footnotemark>\n     10\n    </footnotemark>\n    See 1 McCormick on Evid. \u00a7 72.1 (7th ed.) (\"[T]rue rules of privilege operate generally to prevent revelation of confidential matter within the context of a judicial proceeding.... [They] do not speak directly to the question of unauthorized revelations of confidential matter outside the judicial setting, and redress ... must be sought in the law of tort or professional responsibility.\" (footnotes omitted)).\n    <footnotemark>\n     11\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-98\">\n    \u00b6 61. Second, the confidentiality statutes cited by amici curiae are not inconsistent with the disclosures required by the duty described here. One statute sets forth a \"bill of rights\" for patients who are admitted to a hospital on an inpatient basis. Among other things, it states that \"[t]he patient has the right to expect that all communications and records pertaining to his or her care shall be treated as confidential\" except when authorization is provided.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-99\">\n    18 V.S.A. \u00a7 1852(a)(7). Further, it recognizes a patient's right to privacy and provides that case discussions are confidential and \"[t]hose not directly involved in the patient's care must have the permission of the patient to be present.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11917497\" index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/194/439/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 1852(a)(6). The duty recognized in this decision-to provide certain information to a caregiver actively engaged in the patient's care and treatment plan-is not at odds with these protections, which prevent disclosures to those not directly involved in the patient's care without the patient's permission. Likewise, the mental health statute, 18 V.S.A. \u00a7 7103(b), explicitly states that \"[n]othing in this section shall preclude disclosure ... of information concerning medical condition\" to certain individuals including the person's family, clergy, health care agent, or \"an interested party.\" Again, if the duty applies, it will be to provide information to an interested individual whose ongoing participation in the patient's care is part and parcel of the patient's treatment plan.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-100\">\n    \u00b6 62. Finally, the federal regulations governing HIPAA's Privacy Rule, relied upon by amici, also carve out two exceptions relevant to the disclosure obligation imposed in this decision. The first is a dangerous patient exception to the confidentiality requirement intended to \"avert a serious threat to health or safety\":\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n    (1) Permitted disclosures. A covered entity may, consistent with applicable law and standards of ethical conduct, use or disclose protected health information, if the covered entity, in good faith, believes the use or disclosure:\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-102\">\n    (i)(A) Is necessary to prevent or lessen a serious and imminent threat to the health or safety of a person\n    <em>\n     or the public\n    </em>\n    ; and\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-103\">\n    (B) Is to a person or persons reasonably able to prevent or lessen the threat.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-104\">\n    <extracted-citation index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=45%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20164.512\">\n     45 C.F.R. \u00a7 164.512\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (j) (emphasis added). In this case, the disclosure requirement is imposed to avert a serious threat to health or safety and under circumstances that meet the specific language of \u00a7 (i)(A) and (B). The second exception is for emergency circumstances, allowing limited use and disclosures:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-105\">\n    If the individual is not present, or the opportunity to agree or object to the use or disclosure cannot practicably be provided because of the individual's incapacity or an emergency circumstance, the covered entity may, in the exercise of professional judgment, determine whether the disclosure is in the best interests of the individual and, if so, disclose only the protected health information that is directly relevant to the [family member, other relative, or close personal friend's] involvement with the individual's care or payment related to the individual's health care.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-106\">\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=45%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20164.512\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 164.510(b)(3); see also Office for Civil Rights, A Health Care Provider's Guide to the HIPAA Privacy Rule: Communicating with a Patient's Family, Friends, or Others Involved in the Patient's Care 2, https://perma.cc/9596-MXWK.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-107\">\n    \u00b6 63. As discussed above, plaintiffs' complaint alleges sufficient facts to indicate that the Retreat was well aware of E.R.'s propensity for violence, particularly when off his medication, and that E.R.'s parents likely underestimated the degree of danger E.R. posed to his caretakers and to the public. Similarly, it is evident from the facts that E.R. was sufficiently incapacitated such that disclosure could not be practicably authorized and that information about his condition and violent behavior would have been \"directly relevant\" to the care his parents provided him. We recognize that both of these subsections permit, rather than mandate, unauthorized disclosure in the aforementioned instances, as\n    well as that both predicate the admissions in the medical entity's good faith belief and professional judgment that disclosure was necessary. In essence, by this decision, we are imposing the mandate as a matter of tort law in circumstances where the mental health professionals and institution are authorized, but not obligated, to disclose under HIPAA.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-108\">\n    \u00b6 64. In reaching our decision, we recognize the \"interest in safeguarding the confidential character of psychotherapeutic communications\" as argued by the dissent.\n    <em>\n     Post\n    </em>\n    , \u00b6 90. We are bound by the direction of\n    <em>\n     Peck\n    </em>\n    : \"In the same manner that due care must be exercised in the therapist's determination of what steps may be necessary to protect the potential victim of a patient's threat of harm, so too must due care be exercised in order to ensure that only that information which is necessary to protect the potential victim is revealed.\"\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4754951\" index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/146/61/\">\n     146 Vt. at 68\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4754951\" index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/146/61/\">\n     499 A.2d at 426-27\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Based on the above analysis, we hold that both the Retreat and NKHS had a duty to provide information to E.R.'s parents, both to warn them of E.R.'s risk of violence to themselves and others and to provide them reasonable information to enable them to fulfill their role in keeping him safe. We stress that we are only defining the duty owed by the mental health services providers, and allowing this action to proceed to determine whether defendants breached their duties, and if so, were negligent in doing so. We reverse the dismissal of Counts II and V of plaintiffs' complaint and remand for those counts to proceed.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-109\">\n    III. Duty to Protect\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-110\">\n    \u00b6 65. We next consider plaintiffs' other counts, starting with those against the Retreat. The complaint contains two additional counts with respect to this defendant: (1) that defendant negligently discharged E.R. and this discharge was the proximate cause of plaintiffs' damages; and (2) defendant undertook to render a service to E.R. necessary to protect third parties, failed to exercise due care in the performance of its undertaking, and its negligence was a proximate cause of the damages to plaintiffs. Plaintiffs allege these counts relying upon the general duty expressed in\n    <em>\n     Tarasoff\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Peck\n    </em>\n    and the duty described in \u00a7 41(b)(4) of the Restatement (Third) of Torts. With respect to the second of these duties-that is, to exercise due care in the performance of an undertaking-plaintiffs also rely on \u00a7 324A of the Restatement (Second) of Torts.\n    <footnotemark>\n     12\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-111\">\n    \u00b6 66. Relying principally on our decision in\n    <em>\n     Sorge\n    </em>\n    , the Retreat argues that these duties do not exist or do not apply here. We begin with the sources of law as argued by the parties.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-112\">\n    \u00b6 67. We look first at\n    <em>\n     Sorge\n    </em>\n    , the most relevant of our precedents. In\n    <em>\n     Sorge\n    </em>\n    , one of the plaintiffs was injured after being assaulted by a juvenile offender who was in the custody of the Vermont Department of Social and Rehabilitation Services (SRS). The victim and his wife filed suit against the State, alleging that SRS was negligent in failing to adequately supervise and control the juvenile and that, as a result of the negligence, the victim sustained injuries. The plaintiffs claimed that SRS was aware of the juvenile's \"history of violent, assaultive and delinquent behavior,\" but that SRS nonetheless placed him in the temporary custody of his mother for the weekend and she \"was either unlikely or incapable of adequately supervising him.\"\n    <em>\n     Sorge\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"370017\" index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/171/171/#p174\">\n     171 Vt. at 173\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"370017\" index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/171/171/#p174\">\n     762 A.2d at 818\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-113\">\n    \u00b6 68. We began by summarizing the factors to be considered in determining whether a governmental body has a duty of care to a specific person, beyond its duty to the public at large:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-114\">\n    (1) whether an ordinance or statute sets forth mandatory acts clearly for the protection of a particular class of persons, rather than the public as a whole; (2) whether the government has actual knowledge of a condition dangerous to those persons; (3) whether there has been reliance by those persons on the government's representations and conduct; and (4) whether failure by the government to use due care would increase the risk of harm beyond its present potential.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-115\">\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"370017\" index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/171/171/#p174\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"370017\" index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/171/171/#p174\">\n     at 174\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"370017\" index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/171/171/#p174\">\n     762 A.2d at 819\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The plaintiffs conceded that there was no specific statutory provision mandating protection for the victim or any other particular class of persons, arguing instead that because SRS's failure to control the juvenile resulted in harm, liability should be imposed on the State. The plaintiffs further contended that \u00a7 319 of the Restatement (Second) of Torts creates an exception for \"persons having dangerous propensities\" that extends beyond the duty to warn and imposes an obligation to control an offender for the protection of the public. This section provides: \"One who takes charge of a third person whom he knows or should know to be likely to cause bodily harm to others if not controlled is under a duty to exercise reasonable care to control the third person to prevent him from doing such harm.\" Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 319. Thus, the section creates an exception for cases where a \"special relationship\" exists between the State and the juvenile.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-116\">\n    \u00b6 69. We rejected both arguments. We found the first theory at odds with the principle espoused in both\n    <em>\n     Peck\n    </em>\n    and Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 315 that \"[g]enerally, there is no duty to control the conduct of another in order to protect a third person from harm.\"\n    <em>\n     Sorge,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"370017\" index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/171/171/#p174\">\n     171 Vt. at 175\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"370017\" index=\"163\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/171/171/#p174\">\n     762 A.2d at 819\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . We also found the \"special relationship\" theory to be inconsistent with the goals of rehabilitation and reunification underlying both juvenile and adult detention programs.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"370017\" index=\"164\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/171/171/#p174\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"370017\" index=\"164\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/171/171/#p174\">\n     at 177-78\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"370017\" index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/171/171/#p174\">\n     762 A.2d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    820-21 ; see also\n    <em>\n     Rivers v.

We further observed that the \u00a7 319 exception had been rejected by a number of other states \"that have recognized that most juvenile and adult programs dealing with persons committed to the custody of the State are intended to rehabilitate conduct rather than control it.\"\n    <em>\n     Sorge\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"370017\" index=\"170\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/171/171/#p174\">\n     171 Vt. at 177\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"370017\" index=\"171\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/171/171/#p174\">\n     762 A.2d at 820-21\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-117\">\n    \u00b6 70. Importantly, we stated that for \u00a7 319 to apply, the State's purpose in assuming custody of an individual \"must explicitly be to control that person\" and that \"attempts to exercise that control must be consistent with the specific objective of insulating a person having dangerous propensities from uncontrolled contact with others whom the State knows or has reason to know are likely to be harmed by the person the State intends to isolate.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"370017\" index=\"172\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/171/171/#p174\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"370017\" index=\"172\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/171/171/#p174\">\n     at 180\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"370017\" index=\"173\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/171/171/#p174\">\n     762 A.2d at 822-23\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

Returning to plaintiffs' theory of duty and liability in this case, we can find no jurisdiction that has adopted Restatement (Third) of Torts \u00a7 41(b)(4). The Reporter's Notes to \u00a7 41(b)(4) cite cases from seven jurisdictions that have adopted a duty commensurate with that in \u00a7 41(b)(4) and broad enough to support the counts included in plaintiffs' complaint here. As defendant points out, many of these decisions have been superseded by statutes that narrow the duty.\n    <footnotemark>\n     13\n    </footnotemark>\n    Two cases in particular are helpful to understanding arguments for a broad expression of duty.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-119\">\n    \u00b6 72.

In that case, a police officer was shot and killed by a former mental patient who had been recently released from involuntary commitment to a mental institution. The officer's spouse brought a wrongful death action against the state, the psychiatric hospital, and the treating psychiatrist, alleging that the psychiatrist was negligent in releasing the patient. The court held that:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-120\">\n    [W]hen, as here, a staff psychiatrist of a state mental health facility is considering whether to release an involuntarily committed mental patient, the psychiatrist has a legal duty to exercise due care, consistent with the knowledge and skill ordinarily possessed by psychiatric practitioners under similar circumstances, to determine whether the patient has a propensity for violence and would thereby present an unreasonable risk of serious bodily harm to others if released from the involuntary commitment, and, further, that in discharging this legal duty the psychiatrist may be required to take reasonable precautions to protect the public from the danger created by the release of the involuntarily committed patient, including the giving of due consideration to extending the term of the patient's commitment or to placing appropriate conditions and restrictions on the patient's release.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-121\">\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10397551\" index=\"176\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/768/1198/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10397551\" index=\"176\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/768/1198/\">\n     at 1200\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

The court in\n    <em>\n     Adams\n    </em>\n    reiterated this holding, particularly differing with the\n    <em>\n     Morgan\n    </em>\n    analysis that the duty to the patient and the duty to third parties are the same.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"457770\" index=\"197\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/258/289/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    It also expressed concern as to whether the policy of holding patients in the least restrictive environment would be consistent with a broad liability rule.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"457770\" index=\"198\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/258/289/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-128\">\n    \u00b6 77. Here, the parties' arguments, joined by amicus curiae representing the mental health provider community, mirror the arguments in the cases described above. The briefs provide us with cites to,\n    and excerpts from, articles and studies that support or oppose the claim that mental health provider liability of the type sought here will cause an increase in unjustified commitments and abandonment of treatment-in-the-least-restrictive-environment requirement, as well as the claim that mental health professionals cannot predict dangerousness with sufficient accuracy to act on their prediction. While these studies inform our decision, we do not find sufficient consensus to act primarily on them. They do suggest, however, that whatever decision we reach in this case, the liability issues are appropriate for legislative action, as has happened in many other states, to consider more thoroughly the policy arguments and evidence.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-129\">\n    \u00b6 78. Returning to the parties' arguments, both plaintiffs and defendants contend that we have essentially decided this case with respect to the duty not to release, with plaintiffs relying upon the broad statement of duty in\n    <em>\n     Peck\n    </em>\n    and defendants relying upon the limitations on duty imposed by\n    <em>\n     Sorge\n    </em>\n    . We conclude that defendants have the stronger support of this aspect of the arguments. It would be difficult for us to reconcile the holding in\n    <em>\n     Sorge\n    </em>\n    with a holding that the Retreat had a duty not to release E.R. as a matter of public protection. In saying this, we specifically reject reliance on the Restatement (Third) of Torts \u00a7 41(b)(4)'s special rule for mental health professionals. We conclude that if mental health professionals have a broad duty of public protection to institutionalize patients who may be dangerous, child protection workers would have a similar duty to institutionalize a juvenile who may be dangerous to the public. Our decision in\n    <em>\n     Sorge\n    </em>\n    rejects such a duty.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-130\">\n    \u00b6 79. We are also reluctant to impose on mental health professionals a duty to third persons generally to seek to prevent the release of a voluntary patient. We are concerned by the broad scope of such a duty and its consequences on the mental health system. See 18 V.S.A. \u00a7 7251(3) ;\n    <em>\n     In re R.L.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"846789\" index=\"199\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/163/168/#p173\">\n     163 Vt. 168\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 173,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"846789\" index=\"200\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/163/168/#p173\">\n     657 A.2d 180\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 184 (1995) (stating that this Court requires consideration of voluntary alternatives first before resorting to involuntary order because involuntary treatment for mental illness is massive curtailment of liberty often resulting in social stigmatization). In\n    <em>\n     Sorge\n    </em>\n    , we recognized the conflict between the state's obligation to rehabilitate the juvenile involved and the obligation to protect the public.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"370017\" index=\"201\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/171/171/#p174\">\n     171 Vt. at 177\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"370017\" index=\"202\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/171/171/#p174\">\n     762 A.2d at 820\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . We resolved that conflict decisively in favor of rehabilitation in a noninstitutional setting. Consistent with\n    <em>\n     Sorge\n    </em>\n    , we must resolve the conflict in the same way here. Thus, we elect not to impose a duty.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-131\">\n    \u00b6 80. We also reject on narrower grounds plaintiffs' claim that defendant Brattleboro Retreat can be liable for negligent performance of an undertaking under \u00a7 324A of the Restatement (Second) of Torts. That section requires plaintiffs to show one of three circumstances. The only one possibly applicable in this case is \u00a7 324A(a): that defendants' \"failure to exercise reasonable care increases the risk of such harm.\" The standard of comparison for this subsection is not the risk of harm created if defendant exercised reasonable care, as under that standard the element would always be met. Instead, the standard is the risk of harm that would be present if defendant never undertook to render the services. Plaintiffs cannot show, and do not allege, that defendant's care increased the risk to third persons.\n    <em>\n     Mu r ph y v. Sent ry Ins.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4218377\" index=\"203\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/196/92/\">\n     2014 VT 25\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , \u00b6 28,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4218377\" index=\"204\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/196/92/\">\n     196 Vt. 92\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4218377\" index=\"205\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/196/92/\">\n     95 A.3d 985\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n    <footnotemark>\n     14\n    </footnotemark>\n    Therefore, \u00a7 324A does not apply.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-132\">\n    \u00b6 81. Finally, our holding on these counts of the complaint against the Retreat apply equally against NKHS, the outpatient service provider. Indeed, courts have held that duties to control are lesser in outpatient programs because the ability to control the behavior of the patient is more limited. See\n    <em>\n     Santana v. Rainbow Cleaners, Inc.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7258935\" index=\"206\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/969/653/#p665\">\n     969 A.2d 653\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 665-66 (R.I.2009). Plaintiffs alleged in count VI that NKHS had a duty to treat E.R. such that the risk of harm to the public would be reduced. We decline to impose such a duty. For the reason expressed above with respect to the Retreat, we hold that Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 324A does not impose a duty to the public on NKHS to exercise reasonable care in its undertaking to provide services to E.R.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-133\">\n    \u00b6 82. We emphasize the narrowness of our ruling today. The question before us in connection with this motion to dismiss is whether we can conclude beyond doubt that \"there exist no facts or circumstances that would entitle the plaintiff to relief.\"\n    <em>\n     Bethel v. Mount Anthony Union High Sch. Dist.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1525508\" index=\"207\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/173/633/#p634\">\n     173 Vt. 633\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 634,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1525508\" index=\"208\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/173/633/#p634\">\n     795 A.2d 1215\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1217 (2002) (mem.) (quotations omitted). Even applying this liberal standard, we have concluded that defendants had no duty enforceable by a third party to treat E.R., to seek involuntary commitment of E.R., or to adopt a particular discharge plan. The only potential duty we recognize in this case, as in\n    <em>\n     Peck\n    </em>\n    , involves a duty to provide certain information in a specific class of cases. That duty applies when a caregiver is actively engaging with the patient's provider in connection with the patient's care, the patient's treatment plan (or in this case, discharge plan) substantially relies on that caregiver's ongoing participation, and the caregiver is himself or herself within the zone of danger of the patient's violent propensities.\n    <footnotemark>\n     15\n    </footnotemark>\n    The information to be conveyed is reasonable information to notify the caregiver of the risks, and of steps he or she can take to mitigate the risks. This duty is, in turn, limited by HIPAA and any other applicable statute restricting such disclosures. A provider has no duty to convey any information in violation of HIPAA.\n    <footnotemark>\n     16\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-134\">\n    \u00b6 83. We also note the significant obstacles this and similar claims face. In addition to proving the necessary facts to establish the limited duty recognized above, plaintiffs here will have to establish the content of the reasonable disclosure, and a failure to provide that information. Not only must plaintiffs prove duty and breach, they will have to prove causation-that any failure to inform they can prove was more likely than not a but-for cause of their injuries.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-135\">\n    \u00b6 84. In summary, we hold that counts II and V of plaintiffs' complaint (the \"failure to warn\" counts), as construed to include elements of count III (the \"failure to train\" count that was otherwise properly dismissed) state causes of action that survive a motion to dismiss. In all other respects,\n    the motion to dismiss was properly granted. As discussed in the foregoing paragraphs, we do not adopt \u00a7 41 of the Restatement (Third) of Torts.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-136\">\n    <em>\n     Affirmed on plaintiffs' failure-to-treat, failure-to-train, and negligent-undertaking claims.

See\n     <em>\n      Kuligoski v. Rapoza\n     </em>\n     , No. 42-2-113 Cacv (Vt.Sup.Ct. May 13, 2015). The superior court in that case granted summary judgment for defendants and dismissed the action on May 13, 2015. The parties have stipulated that we can use the decision in that case in deciding this appeal. We take that stipulation to mean that we can consider the undisputed facts as considered in that decision in addition to the factual allegations made in the complaint in this case. The statement of facts in the body of this opinion is based on both sources.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"2\">\n    <p id=\"p-186\">\n     Without filing an application in the superior court for involuntary treatment or accepting E.R. as a voluntary patient, the Vermont State Hospital could only hold E.R. for seventy-two hours after the physician's certification. See 18 V.S.A. \u00a7 7508(d). Since no court order was sought, we conclude that E.R. must have been considered a voluntary patient. Although the record does not show conclusively whether E.R. was an adult, the facts indicate that his symptoms first arose in 2009 at the beginning of his sophomore year in college and his hospital treatment occurred over a year later. It is very likely he was an adult, but was still living with his parents.

Thus, those courts that have broadened the therapist's duty to all \"foreseeable\" victims without limitation have resolved the dilemma posed by the risk of over-commitment essentially by ignoring it; under these rulings, anyone injured by a mental health patient may argue that, in retrospect, the therapist was negligent in failing to detain the patient. In states like Vermont, however, where public policy militates against the recognition of a duty to control a patient through involuntary hospitalization-a policy reaffirmed by the majority today-extending the duty to the public at large is not a sound or practical option. See\n    <em>\n     ante\n    </em>\n    , \u00b6 77 (rejecting imposition of duty to institutionalize mental health patient in order to avoid \"an increase in unjustified commitments and abandonment of treatment-in-the-least-restrictive-environment\" policy).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-147\">\n    \u00b6 94. Most states, as noted, have pursued an approach\n    <em>\n     between\n    </em>\n    these two extremes. Through case law or legislation they have struck a balance among the competing concerns by recognizing a relatively narrow duty of care limited to situations where the therapist knows or should know that a patient poses a specific threat to an identified or reasonably identifiable third person. This standard, as one court has observed, \"evinces a sound public policy against expanding the liability of health professionals to an indeterminate class of potential plaintiffs.\"\n    <em>\n     Eckhardt\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"255\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=128%20Ill.%20Dec.%20734\">\n     128 Ill.Dec. 734\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"256\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=534%20N.E.2d%201339\">\n     534 N.E.2d at 1345\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . It reflects a considered policy judgment that the societal costs of breaching the therapeutic bond based on generalized threats of violence-all too commonplace in the therapeutic setting\n    <footnotemark>\n     24\n    </footnotemark>\n    -do not justify whatever uncertain benefits may flow from expanding the duty to unspecified third parties based on an inherently inexact risk assessment made all the more difficult where the potential target is not identified.

This balancing of interests was cogently addressed by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in considering \"the conundrum a mental health care professional faces regarding the competing concerns of productive therapy, confidentiality and other aspects of the patient's well being, as well as the interest in public safety.\"\n    <em>\n     Emerich v.

In addition, as noted, numerous states have codified similar, practical limits on a mental health care provider's duty of care to third parties. See D. Mossman,\n    <em>\n     Critique of Pure Risk Assessment or, Kant Meets Tarasoff\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"267\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=75%20U.%20Cin.%20L.%20Rev.%20523\">\n     75 U.

The point here is not that the Court has adopted a minority position without expressly acknowledging it. If that were the problem, it would be enough to simply articulate the competing viewpoint, and agree to disagree. However ill-advised the majority's choice, it would at least be based on familiar ground. And while the decision to abandon a standard that so many states have found to be the proper\n    balance between competing public-policy interests might be mistaken, it would at least have the virtue of transparency.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-150\">\n    \u00b6 97. The problem here is altogether different, however, and far more serious. For the majority not only expands the scope of a therapist's duty beyond the limits recognized by this Court in\n    <em>\n     Peck\n    </em>\n    , it creates an entirely new duty of care which plaintiffs here have labeled a duty to \"train\" and the majority sees fit to recast as \"a duty to 'inform' that incorporates some elements of what plaintiffs describe as a distinct duty to 'train.' \"\n    <em>\n     Ante\n    </em>\n    , \u00b6 53. Elsewhere, the majority variously describe this as: \"a duty of care to provide reasonable information to the parents to enable them to recognize the dangers and fulfill the responsibilities envisioned for them in the treatment plan,\"\n    <em>\n     ante\n    </em>\n    , \u00b6 44; a duty that \"contemplates more than simply advising the parents that their son posed a risk,\" but also providing \"reasonable information ... to help keep their son safe,\"\n    <em>\n     ante\n    </em>\n    , \u00b6 53; and a duty to notify the caregiver of the risks \"and of steps he or she can take to mitigate the risks,\"\n    <em>\n     ante\n    </em>\n    , \u00b6 82.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-151\">\n    \u00b6 98. If mental health care providers, patients and their families, and the legal counsel who advise them remain uncertain as to the precise nature and scope of this new duty, they are to be forgiven. For the Court is making this up as it goes, with no input from the mental health profession on whether standards even exist for such a duty. This is not an easy task. But the real difficulty lies ahead, when this Court has moved on and the mental health care community must continue to grapple with the implications.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-152\">\n    \u00b6 99. For make no mistake, this holding is extraordinary in its scope and implications. To recall, most duty-to-protect cases have divided along a fault-line between those limiting the duty to identified or reasonably identifiable targets of violence and those that would include all \"foreseeable\" victims, the latter generally predicated on a duty to treat and, if necessary, confine a dangerous patient given the general impracticality of warning all remote, albeit foreseeable victims. The majority rejects the principle that a therapist's duty extends only to reasonably identifiable targets of specific threats by the patient. It also rejects as a matter of policy any duty to control a mental health patient through involuntary commitment.\n    <em>\n     Ante\n    </em>\n    , \u00b6 79.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-153\">\n    \u00b6 100. Out of this seeming impasse the majority creates a new duty-a duty to warn not the patient or the patient's targeted victims, but the patient's parents or, more broadly, his or her \"caretakers\" so that\n    <em>\n     they\n    </em>\n    may control the patient and prevent injury to the public. This is worth a moment's reflection. As a matter of policy, according to the majority, no liability may attach to E.R.'s mental health providers for their allegedly negligent failure to control E.R.'s conduct by providing for his involuntary commitment. Nevertheless, liability may attach to the same defendants for their allegedly negligent failure to enable E.R.'s parents to control his conduct by providing them with adequate warning and information to \"mitigate the risks.\"\n    <em>\n     Ante\n    </em>\n    , \u00b6 82.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-154\">\n    \u00b6 101. The imposition of a duty so novel and with such potentially broad consequences for mental health care providers, their patients, and the general public surely requires a more solid foundation than an allegation in a complaint. Recognizing that this case remains at the pleading stage,\n    <em>\n     duty\n    </em>\n    nevertheless constitutes an essential element of plaintiffs' cause of action, and its existence is a question of law which this Court must decide in the first instance in light of all relevant policy concerns. See\n    <em>\n     Endres v. Endres\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3694472\" index=\"268\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/185/63/\">\n     2008 VT 124\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , \u00b6 11,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3694472\" index=\"269\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/185/63/\">\n     185 Vt. 63\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3694472\" index=\"270\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/185/63/\">\n     968 A.2d 336\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (noting that \"[d]uty ... is central to a negligence claim\" and\n    that \"its existence is primarily a question of law\" based on \"those considerations of policy which lead the law to say that the plaintiff is entitled to protection\" (quotation omitted)). Yet nothing in plaintiffs' complaint even remotely identifies the basis for recognizing a so-called duty to \"inform\" a patient's parents or \"caretakers\" to protect the public. Nothing in plaintiffs' briefing below or before this Court identifies any medical treatises or other literature defining and describing the basic clinical standards, practices, and therapeutic goals underlying such a duty. Nothing in the briefing identifies any decisional law or authority elsewhere specifically recognizing and imposing such a duty.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-155\">\n    \u00b6 102. We do, on the other hand, know from plaintiffs' complaint that certain actions were taken by defendants after E.R.'s discharge. We know that the Brattleboro Retreat made an aftercare treatment plan for E.R. and reviewed it with E.R. and his parents, and that the plan \"involved E.R. being seen on a regular basis\" at NKHS. We know that the medical professionals at the Retreat prescribed medications for E.R. to take on a daily basis. We know that E.R. met with a \"treatment team\" at NKHS, and that a \"cognitive remediation therapy\" plan was put in place and signed by E.R. We know that E.R told his mother in mid-December 2010 that he had ceased taking his medications, and that she reported this to NKHS. And we know that, on the day of the assault, E.R.'s father had taken E.R. with him to oversee work being done at an apartment building owned by E.R.'s grandfather.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-156\">\n    \u00b6 103. These facts themselves, hardly unique, highlight the most significant deficiency in the majority's newfound duty. Even assuming that plaintiffs could establish through expert evidence some professional standards for the duty owed to a patient's caretaker, the imposition of such a duty demands consideration of the policy implications underlying it-its practical benefits against its societal costs. See\n    <em>\n     Langle v. Kurkul\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4758969\" index=\"271\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/146/513/#p519\">\n     146 Vt. 513\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 519,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4758969\" index=\"272\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/146/513/#p519\">\n     510 A.2d 1301\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1305 (1986) (noting that existence of duty is primarily question of law dependent on variety of policy concerns, including \"the closeness of the connection between the defendant's conduct and the injury suffered,\" the \"burden to the defendant,\" and the \"consequences to the community\" (quotation omitted)).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-157\">\n    \u00b6 104. The facts alleged by plaintiffs show that, even with the practical steps undertaken by defendants and E.R.'s parents to facilitate his functioning safely in a less restrictive environment than a closed hospital ward-providing an aftercare plan and reviewing it with E.R.'s parents, establishing an outpatient treatment team, prescribing him daily medication, endeavoring to monitor his activity by taking him to job sites, and reporting that he had stopped his medication-they could not prevent him from perpetrating a spontaneous act of violence.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-158\">\n    \u00b6 105. The majority's speculation that defendants might have provided some additional \"information\" to E.R.'s parents to prevent the assault simply misses the point. To impose such a duty on health care providers undermines the fundamental policy underlying our mental health care system, a policy designed to maximize a patient's freedom and dignity by providing treatment in the least restrictive environment available. It is the same policy resoundingly reaffirmed by the majority today in refusing to impose a tort duty on health care providers to institutionalize a patient. See\n    <em>\n     ante\n    </em>\n    , \u00b6 77 (rejecting duty to institutionalize mental health patient to avoid \"an increase in unjustified commitments and abandonment of treatment-in-the-least-restrictive-environment\" policy).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-159\">\n    \u00b6 106. Uncertainty counsels caution, for courts and clinicians alike. Any responsible mental health care provider uncertain as to how, if at all, to satisfy this new, amorphous duty to train or assist a patient's \"caretaker\" sufficiently to prevent future harm might understandably decide to err on the side of a more-rather than a less-restrictive treatment setting rather than risk a lawsuit by the random victim of an outpatient assault. Moreover, considering the many adult patients living with someone who could be characterized as a \"caretaker\"-be it the patient's parents, spouse, domestic partner, or friend-the consequences of such decisions could be far reaching. Balanced against the dubious odds of actually predicting, much less preventing, random acts of violence by a patient absent any specific threat or identifiable victim, the risk becomes prohibitive.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-160\">\n    \u00b6 107. The expected response to these concerns is that they are merely \"speculative\" while we know-in contrast-that mental health providers routinely make predictions of dangerousness in deciding to commit a patient and routinely apply\n    <em>\n     Tarasoff\n    </em>\n    when deciding whether a patient poses a threat. Thus, it is easy to posit that the concern for overcommitment is exaggerated or unfounded, that no responsible mental health care provider would involuntarily hospitalize a nondangerous patient to avoid a lawsuit, much less release a dangerous one despite the risk to the public.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-161\">\n    \u00b6 108. The flaw in this response is the assumption that there are \"yes\" or \"no\" answers to the mental health clinician's decisions. The relevant medical and legal literature, however, belies this assumption. There are, in fact, no answers, but only imperfect assessments of differential levels of risk, and there are no clear standards defining the level of risk sufficient to trigger protective measures. See, e.g., Mossman,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    , 75 U. Cin. L. Rev., at 567, 577 (observing that most recent medical studies show that \"a therapist's predictive knowledge about future violence is really an ability to make risk estimates,\" while \"there is and can be no rationally established, broadly accepted criterion for what probability of risk constitutes the level of 'serious danger' that should trigger a protective response\"); Herbert,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    , J. Am. Acad. of Psychiatry &amp; Law, at 422 (noting the \"residuum of uncertainty\" in assessing whether \"a patient really means particular words as a threat\").\n    <em>\n     Tarasoff\n    </em>\n    has worked, according to surveys and studies, because most states employ reasonably clear, narrow, and understandable standards that require a serious threat to a reasonably identifiable target. See, e.g., Rosenhan,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    , 24 Pac. L.J., at 1203, 1208, 1217 (findings from broad survey of psychotherapists showed that, while very small percentage rated their ability to assess dangerousness \"very accurately,\" most understood duty to protect was predicated on identification of specific victim and believed that duty was consistent with ethical obligations); Mossman,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    , 75 U. Cin. L. Rev., at 603 (noting that clinicians have sought and been well served by \"statutory boundaries on the duty to protect, boundaries that tell them when the duty arises (usually, following explicit threats toward specific targets) and that define specific ways of discharging the duty\"); M. Soulier, et al.,\n    <em>\n     Status of the Psychiatric Duty to Protect, Circa 2006\n    </em>\n    , 38 J. Am. Acad. of Psychiatry &amp; Law 457, 471-72 (2010) (concluding from surveys of psychotherapists and review of legal evolution of\n    <em>\n     Tarasoff\n    </em>\n    duty that \"statutes appear to promote a useful social policy, limiting the duty to protect to cases in which victims are identified or reasonably identifiable\" and as such pose little threat to clinician's ability to practice). The broad duty created by the majority, in contrast, contains none of the limits that form a\n    natural and necessary counterbalance to the risks of defensive practice and overcommitment in the mental-health context.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-162\">\n    \u00b6 109. To dismiss the concerns of the mental health care profession in this case as speculative or even self-serving, moreover, is presumptuous. It is all too easy to assign new duties to a profession we know little about, and have no responsibility to implement. Judicial restraint in creating duties for other professions is not an end in itself; it is the end-result of recognizing our own limitations. It is wisdom grounded in humility.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-163\">\n    \u00b6 110. The majority ultimately attempts to minimize its decision's impact by noting the \"significant obstacles\" in the way of any successful lawsuit, including the plaintiffs' need to prove the \"necessary facts,\" a failure to disclose the necessary information, as well as \"causation-that any failure to inform ... was more likely than not a but-for cause of their injuries.\"\n    <em>\n     Ante\n    </em>\n    , \u00b6 83. This may reassure the majority, but it is cold comfort to the mental health care providers and their colleagues and families compelled to endure the personal and professional disruptions, stress, and financial burdens of protracted lawsuits predicated on this amorphous new duty, regardless of their ultimate success.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-164\">\n    \u00b6 111. Finally, I would note that the majority's alternative basis for imposing a duty of care predicated on its conclusion that \"E.R.'s parents fell within the 'zone of danger' from E.R.'s conduct\" is equally flawed and unpersuasive.\n    <em>\n     Ante\n    </em>\n    , \u00b6 47. The zone-of-danger doctrine, as noted, simply extends the therapist's duty to persons within a finite class of reasonably identifiable potential targets. Thus, in the case cited by the majority,\n    <em>\n     Hamman v. County of Maricopa\n    </em>\n    , the record showed that the patient had \"expressed jealousy of his stepfather\" to the therapist; that the patient's parents had expressed concern to the therapist for their safety and begged the therapist to admit the patient to the hospital; that the therapist failed to do so; and that the patient subsequently attacked his stepfather with an electric drill.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1482207\" index=\"273\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/161/58/\">\n     775 P.2d at 1123-24\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Based on these facts, the court reasonably concluded that, despite the absence of a specific verbalized threat against the parents, they \"were readily identifiable persons who might suffer harm.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 1128.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-165\">\n    \u00b6 112. Despite the majority's statement that it \"find[s]\n    <em>\n     Hamman\n    </em>\n    persuasive and follow[s] its reasoning,\"\n    <em>\n     ante\n    </em>\n    , \u00b6 49, nothing on the limited factual record here brings this case within the \"zone of danger\" doctrine articulated in\n    <em>\n     Hamman\n    </em>\n    and elsewhere. First, the complaint did not allege that E.R. had threatened either his parents or a class of persons that might reasonably be construed to include his parents.\n    <footnotemark>\n     25\n    </footnotemark>\n    Nor did plaintiffs claim, as the majority argues, that E.R.'s earlier aggression toward a member of the staff at the Retreat somehow brought E.R.'s parents into the zone of danger applicable to all \"caretakers.\" To suggest that a threat against a nurse, therapist, physician or other mental health care provider somehow represents a threat against an identifiable class of all family members and friends who help with the patient's outpatient care would stretch the \"zone of danger\" doctrine beyond recognition.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-166\">\n    \u00b6 113. Second, and more significantly, the doctrine was designed to protect a slightly expanded class of reasonably identifiable potential\n    <em>\n     victims\n    </em>\n    , and E.R.'s parents were not the victims here. As noted,\n    plaintiffs did not allege any threats-explicit, implicit, or otherwise-against his parents. Nor is there any factual basis to support a conclusion that the actual victim, Mr. Kuligoski, was within an identified or identifiable class of potential victims. The \"zone of danger\" argument thus fails entirely.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-167\">\n    \u00b6 114.

I concur in the Chief Justice's well-reasoned, indeed unassailable, dissent. The majority has created a heretofore unheard of duty based on an allegation in a complaint. This new duty to train or assist or inform a patient's caretakers so as to protect the public finds no support in case law or public policy. It is illogical, potentially fatal to effective patient-therapist relationships, and places an impossibly onerous obligation on those who provide mental health care to the people of this state.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-171\">\n    \u00b6 117. The facts of this case center around an unprovoked, spontaneous act of violence directed against a stranger by an individual suffering from a serious mental illness. Nothing short of anticipatory confinement in a hospital could have prevented it. But now, severely crippling Vermont's public policy of treatment of the mentally ill in the least restrictive environment, the majority has delivered a cautionary tale involving the threat of tort liability for releasing a mentally ill person to people not sufficiently warned/trained to provide care and control. This is a preposterous, reckless decision.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-172\">\n    \u00b6 118. The majority opinion identifies the cautious and thoughtful evolution of the duty owed by mental health professionals begun in\n    <em>\n     Tarasoff v.

It then abruptly abandons consideration of identified victims or reasonably identifiable victims and finds a duty \"to warn E.R.'s parents as individuals in the 'zone of danger' of E.R.'s dangerous propensities.\"\n    <em>\n     Ante\n    </em>\n    , \u00b6 51. However, in the next paragraph it limits the duty only to those who are engaged with the patient's treatment, not those that simply live with him.\n    <em>\n     Ante\n    </em>\n    , \u00b6 52. That \"zone\" is flexible, fluid and ambiguous.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-173\">\n    \u00b6 119. First of all, I posit that the parents of E.R. knew he could be dangerous as it was his behaviors in their home that precipitated his initial hospitalization. They were privy to the discharge summary from the Brattleboro Retreat and worked with the Retreat to develop an aftercare treatment plan that included regular visits to Northeast Kingdom Human Services (NKHS). They were aware he was on antipsychotic medications and had been told that they should give E.R. his medications and not rely on him to medicate himself. The mother knew enough to be concerned when E.R. told her he had stopped taking his medication. They had been warned.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-174\">\n    They knew E.R. could be dangerous when deep in his illness. What further warning should have been offered remains a mystery.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-175\">\n    \u00b6 120. What is substantially more troubling is the framework upon which the majority builds its new duty. As explained by the Chief Justice in his dissent, the majority relies on the \"zone-of-danger\" doctrine that simply is not implicated in this case. There is no allegation E.R. threatened his parents. The parents were not injured. And, the actual victim could not have been identified as a reasonably identifiable potential victim, the expanded class the doctrine is designed to protect.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-176\">\n    \u00b6 121. The majority finds\n    <em>\n     Hamman v. County of Maricopa\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1482207\" index=\"303\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/161/58/\">\n     161 Ariz. 58\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1482207\" index=\"304\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/161/58/\">\n     775 P.2d 1122\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1989), \"persuasive\" and claims to follow its reasoning. The\n    <em>\n     Hamman\n    </em>\n    case is completely distinguishable from the case at bar. In\n    <em>\n     Hamman\n    </em>\n    , the doctor refused to admit the patient to the hospital and, according to the parents, told them their son was \"harmless.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 1123. Two days later, the son viciously attacked the stepfather. The court noted that the doctor was aware that schizophrenic-psychotic patients are prone to unexpected episodes of violence, knew that the son was living with his parents, and thus should have known that \"[i]f indeed [the doctor] negligently diagnosed [the son] as harmless, the most likely affected victims would be the Hammans. Their constant physical proximity to [their son] placed them in an obvious zone of danger. The Hammans were readily identifiable persons who might suffer harm if the psychiatrist was negligent in the diagnosis or treatment of the patient.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 1128. The majority neglects to provide any analysis to link the case at bar with the situation described in\n    <em>\n     Hamman\n    </em>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-177\">\n    \u00b6 122. Under this new duty, mental health providers will have to consider generalized threats of violence directed against no one in particular, which I suggest are commonplace with severely ill patients, and will have to weigh whether to violate the patient-physician privilege, thus damaging whatever therapeutic relationship existed and perhaps the treatment of the patient as well. After the risk assessment, they will then, in trying to place the patient in the least restrictive environment available, need to do an educational assessment of potential caregivers. As the Chief Justice notes, the majority identifies no professional standards, legal authority, or public policies to support a duty so \"extraordinary in its scope and implications.\"\n    <em>\n     Ante\n    </em>\n    , \u00b6 99. Long after this Court has forgotten about it, this amorphous duty to train or assist will continue to perplex and bedevil practitioners in the field of mental health who must actually attempt to understand the obligations imposed and comply.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-178\">\n    \u00b6 123. Finally, the majority disposes of statutes and regulations that govern confidential communications between patient and physician by suggesting that, one, they only codify an evidentiary privilege, and two, they do not prohibit disclosure to \"caregivers\" involved in the patient's aftercare plan.\n    <em>\n     Ante\n    </em>\n    , \u00b6 61. This is a breathtaking disregard for the tort liabilities or ethical claims that can result from the disclosure of health information or history and a startling conclusion that no objection occurs to them for the wholesale disclosure of a person's mental health condition and history to the ambiguous sobriquet \"caretaker.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-179\">\n    \u00b6 124. The manner in which the majority disposes of the requirements of HIPAA's Privacy Rule is rather cavalier. It notes two exceptions relevant to the disclosure obligation imposed in this decision. The first, the dangerous patient exception to the confidentiality requirement intended to \"avert a serious threat to health or safety,\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-180\">\n    permits disclosure when the disclosure \"[i]s necessary to prevent or lessen a serious and imminent threat to the health or safety of a person or the public.\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"305\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=45%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20164.512\">\n     45 C.F.R. \u00a7 164.512\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (j). Relying on \"E.R.'s propensity for violence,\" the majority finds the subsection permits disclosure, ignoring the requirement that a perceived serious threat must be\n    <em>\n     imminent\n    </em>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-181\">\n    \u00b6 125. The majority identifies a second useful exception, one providing for standard uses and disclosures for involvement in an individual's care and notification purposes, citing to the provision for emergency circumstances.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"306\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=45%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20164.510\">\n     45 C.F.R. \u00a7 164.510\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (b)(3). The majority forgets to mention that the section's primary application is for \"Limited uses and disclosures when the individual is not present.\" It then latches onto the conjunctive modifying language contained in the section, \"[i]f the individual is not present, or the opportunity to agree or object to the use or disclosure cannot practicably be provided because of the individual's incapacity or an emergency circumstance,\" to support its dismissal of HIPAA concerns. I suggest that the section is intended to apply when \"the individual's incapacity\" is of a sort that renders him unconscious. Again the majority finds the subsection permits disclosure.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-182\">\n    \u00b6 126. Decisions to create and impose new legal duties on other learned professions have profound consequences. To impose a novel legal duty on mental health care professionals without extensive discussion of the professional knowledge, skills, and practice standards-if any-that may apply and the policy consequences that may result, is not merely, as the Chief Justice suggests, \"presumptuous.\" It is the essence of judicial arrogance.\n   </p>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
