Notwithstanding his absence from the hearing, Respondent has filed exceptions. Those exceptions, rather than challenging the hearing judge's findings of fact or conclusions of law, generally attack the underlying criminal conviction, the Court of Special Appeals' opinion affirming the conviction, and this Court's denial of Respondent's certiorari petition. Respondent also filed a \"Second Motion to Terminate\n   Petition for Disciplinary Action, and/or to Disqualify Bar Counsel Glenn Grossman,\n   Esq., Deputy Bar Counsel Raymond Hein, Esq., and Assistant Bar Counsel Marianne J.

We now explain the reasons for that order, including our decision to overrule Respondent's exceptions and our conclusion that Respondent violated MLRPC 8.4(b), (c), and (d). On December 2, 2016, Respondent filed a \"Motion to Reconsider and Vacate Disbarment Order, to Reinstate and to Reset Oral Argument.\" For the reasons stated in this opinion, we hereby deny that motion.

The hearing judge concluded that Respondent\n   violated MLRPC 8.4(b) because \"it is beyond question\" that the act of theft constitutes a criminal act reflecting on Respondent's honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness to practice law. The hearing judge quoted a portion of the Court of Special Appeals' rejection of Respondent's claim that the conviction was not supported by legally sufficient evidence: \"[A] rational finder of fact could find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Sweitzer willfully or knowingly exerted unauthorized control over [his client] Dr. Tsai's property (specifically, the Penn Mutual settlement and the funds to settle with Nu Image) and that he intended to deprive Dr. Tsai of that property.\"\n   <em>\n    Sweitzer\n   </em>\n   , slip op. at 10-11. The hearing judge concluded that Respondent violated MLRPC 8.4(c) because, as the Court of Special Appeals explained, there was \"copious evidence that Sweitzer was lying to his client, stalling for time, and exploiting his client's friendship and sympathy,\" and Respondent \"intended to deprive his client of the property.\"\n   <em>\n    Sweitzer\n   </em>\n   , slip op. at 12.

Respondent has filed numerous exceptions, but does not specifically refer to any of the hearing judge's findings of fact or conclusions of law. Instead, Respondent argues generally that the hearing judge's findings of fact and conclusions of law were flawed\n   from the outset because Judge Sweeney, who presided at the criminal trial, lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the instant case, rendering the conviction \"void\n   <em>\n    ab initio\n   </em>\n   .\" Respondent argues that the criminal trial\n   was \"nothing but an elaborate hoax: an unauthorized attorney disciplinary proceeding, couched forcibly and impermissibly within the context of a criminal trial, this Court having never conferred subject matter jurisdiction on the trial court to make any foray whatsoever into fact-finding in attorney-client matters.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Respondent further argues that the appellate process \"appears to have been rigged,\" evidently viewing this Court's issuance of the Order of Suspension in the present disciplinary proceeding as \"temporally-coordinated\" with the Court of Special Appeals' opinion affirming the underlying conviction. Respondent also argues that this Court \"abusively denied\" the petition for writ of certiorari. In a similar vein, Respondent charges the hearing judge in this disciplinary matter with having \"failed to even address the subject matter jurisdictional issue.\" Respondent asserts that there was an impermissible \"blending\" of his criminal trial and attorney grievance matter. Respondent's arguments on this point include conflict of interest allegations. According to Respondent, the entire criminal trial constituted a conspiracy between the prosecution and the judiciary. Respondent also asserts that, because his motions to vacate both the criminal conviction and Bar Counsel's petition for disciplinary action went largely unopposed by the State and Bar Counsel, this Court should have granted the motions in Respondent's favor. Finally, Respondent asserts that he \"earned the fee in question in the underlying attorney/client controversy under the prevailing ABA standard, and neither the State nor Bar Counsel has proven otherwise, even under a clear and convincing evidentiary standard.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   We shall treat Respondent's arguments as \"exceptions\" and overrule each of them. Contrary to Respondent's various arguments, there was no impermissible \"blending\" of the criminal and disciplinary matters. Maryland Rule 16-771(b) provides, in pertinent part: \"Upon receiving and verifying\n   information from any source that an attorney has been convicted of a serious crime, Bar Counsel may file a Petition for Disciplinary or Remedial Action in the Court of Appeals.\" Maryland Rule 16-751(a)(2) further provides: \"If authorized by Rule 16-771(b) ..., Bar Counsel may file a Petition for Disciplinary or Remedial Action in the Court of Appeals without prior approval of the Commission.\" The record shows that Bar Counsel complied with those provisions. Upon receipt of proof of the conviction, and following a show cause order, this Court may suspend the attorney pending a final disposition of the disciplinary or remedial action. Md. Rule 16-771(c). This Court's issuance of the Order of Suspension on September 22, 2014, complied with those procedures.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   We overrule as well Respondent's exception that the hearing judge's findings of fact and conclusions of law were flawed at the outset because the hearing judge's factual findings and legal conclusions rested on facts that underlay the verdict of Judge Sweeney, who had found Respondent guilty of theft of funds belonging to Dr. Tsai. In Respondent's view, Judge Sweeney did not have subject matter jurisdiction over Respondent's attorney/client relationship with Dr. Tsai. Respondent does not seem to be arguing that Judge Sweeney did not possess the subject matter\n   jurisdiction to hear and decide the charge of felony theft, for such jurisdiction no doubt resides in the judges of Maryland's circuit courts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Md.%20Code%20Ann.%2C%20Cts.%20%26%20Jud.%20Proc.%20%C2%A7%201-501\">\n    Md.

Rather, Respondent seems to argue that Judge Sweeney had no jurisdiction to decide facts that are within the purview of the attorney grievance process and, once Judge Sweeney wrongly decided the existence of such facts, the hearing judge could not rely upon the conviction as conclusive evidence of\n   Respondent's having violated one or more rules of professional conduct. That argument is unfounded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Facts that give rise to an attorney's having been adjudicated guilty of a crime likewise can establish the attorney's having violated one or more of the rules of professional conduct. That is particularly so when the victim of the attorney's crime is or was the attorney's client. Maryland Rules 16-751 and 16-771 recognize and provide for the Commission and Bar Counsel's response to that situation. In the present case, those rules came into play once Respondent was convicted of felony theft. Thereafter, his conviction was affirmed by the Court of Special Appeals, and this Court denied certiorari review.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   At that point, the hearing judge was entitled to rely upon the final judgment of conviction as \"conclusive evidence\" of Respondent's guilt of theft from his client, Dr. Tsai.
