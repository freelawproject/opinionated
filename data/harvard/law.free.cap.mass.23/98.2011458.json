From depositions in the case it appeared, that for several years'the plaintiff had had a large amount of property under the care of his agent at New York, which was employed in making advances upon goods consigned for sale, and that the profits of the business, accruing from interest on the advances, and from commissions, were not withdrawn, but were added to the capital.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b106-8\">If the Court should.be of opinion that the plaintiff had maintained his action, judgment was to be rendered in his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>/avor for such sum as the Court should order ; if otherwise, he was to become nonsuit.</summary>\n<otherdate data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b107-11\"><em>Jan. 10th, </em>1828, <em>in Suffolk.</em></otherdate>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b107-4\"><em>Choate </em>contended that the plaintiff,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A7UD\">being an inhabitant of and resident in Massachusetts, was not liable to be taxed for property which he had <em>bona fide </em>removed out of the State and placed under the jurisdiction of another State, with the in.antion that it should remain there permanently. In supporting this position he cited <em>Constitution, pt. </em>2, c. 1, \u00a7 1, <em>art. </em>4; Anc. Charters, &amp;c. 69, 70, 71; <em>St. </em>1785, <em>c. </em>50; 1820, <em>c. </em>64; 1821, c. 107; <em>Salem Iron Factory </em>v. Danvers, 10 Mass. R. 514; <em>Rising </em>v. Granger, 1 Mass.

They also contended, that the tax had been paid voluntarily, and so could not be recovered back. <em>Bilbie </em>v. <em>Lumley, </em>2 East, 469; <em>Knibbs </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>1 Esp.

And further, that this was a case of overrating merely, and the plaintiff\u2019s only remedy was an application to the Court of Sessions, pursuant to the statute, (1785, c. 50, \u00a7 10,) to have the tax abated. <em>Stowall </em>v. <em>Flagg, </em>11 Mass.

Whethei the plaintiff was liable to be assessed in this State, for the personal property which he had in trade in New York, is an important question, upon which we are not in this case required to express an opinion;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for admitting that he was not, still we think this action cannot be sustained. The remedy, and the only remedy, for an over valuation and assessment, is under the statute of 1785, c. 50, \u00a7 10, by which it is provided, that whenever any person shall be aggrieved by being overrated in the assessment of any tax, he may apply to the assessors to make a reasonable abatement;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and if they refuse so to do, complaint is to be made, in nature of an appeal, to the Court of General Sessions of the Peace, who are authorized to relieve him.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This is an adequate and convenient remedy : but great mischiefs would follow, if we were to hold that an excess of valuation would render an assessment illegal and void. And it is immaterial whether the excess is caused by including in the valuation, property of which the person taxed is not the owner, or that for which he is not liable to be taxed. In both cases the remedy is the same. As the plaintiff was liable to taxation for his personal property, the assessment was valid, although he was assessed for more than his due proportion.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> His only remedy is by application for an abatement; for when a new right is created by statute, which at the same time provides a remedy for any infringement of it, that remedy must be pursued. 3 Mass. R. 309 ; 6 Mass. R. 44. Without, therefore, discussing the other points in the cause, we are of opinion that the plaintiff is not entitled to recover, and according to the agreement of the parties, a nonsuit must be entered, and judgment for the defendants for costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b108-12\"> See Revised Stat. <em>c. 7, </em>\u00a7 37.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b108-13\"> Complaints of this nature must now be made to the County Commission ers.
