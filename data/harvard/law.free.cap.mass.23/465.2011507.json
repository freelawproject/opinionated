The original count in the writ alleged, that Whitaker, administrator &amp;c. of Davis Packard, on the 27th of June, 1827, the date of the writ, being indebted to the plaintiff in the sum of 2000 dollars for so much money before that time had and received by Packard, promised the plaintiff to pay him the same sum on demand; yet, though often requested, neither Packard in his lifetime, nor, after his death, the defendant, had paid any part of that sum.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-8\">The writ commanded the sheriff &amp;c. to <em>summon </em>the defendant. The officer returned that he <em>attached </em>a chip, the property of the defendant, and gave him a summons.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-9\">The action was entered in the Court of Common Pleas at August Term 1827, and at the following term in November a demurrer was filed for the purpose of bringing up the case to this Court, the parties reserving liberty to plead anew.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-10\">At the first term in this Court the plaintiff obtained leave to amend, upon the common rule ; which he did by striking out the original count, and substituting another, in which it xvas set forth, that Packard, on the 1st day of August, 1825, being indebted to the plaintiff in the sum of 2000 dollars for so much money had and received by Packard, promised the plaintiff to pay him that sum on demand ; yet, though requested, neither Packard in his lifetime, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-11\">' The defendant had leave to plead anew, as of the first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>term, and he offered a plea in abatement, alleging that the ofiicer mac*e service \u00b0f the writ by <em>attaching the property </em>of the defendant and by giving him a summons. The plaintiff objected that it was too late to plead in abatement. The defendant contended,, that under the leave to plead anew, he had a right to file such a plea ; but the judge was of opinion that the leave granted was to be confined to some matter relating to the merits of the declaration as it should be amended, and did not warrant the filing of a plea in abatement of the writ; which remained in its original form. No such plea was offered in the Court of Common Pleas. So the plea in abatement was rejected. The defendant then pleaded the general issue.</summary>\n<otherdate data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b476-6\">\n<em>Sept 23rd</em>\n</otherdate>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b476-4\">The plaintiff offered in evidence a note made to him by Packard, dated June 28, 1824, for 2000 dollars, payable in five years, with interest semiannually ; and also proved the death of Packard, the insolvency of his estate, the presentation of this claim to the commissioners of insolvency, their rejection of it because they thought the plaintiff ought to be confined to a mortgage given him by Packard as security for the note, and notice, pursuant to the statute,' of his intention to prosecute his claim at common law. This action was accordingly brought to recover the difference between the amount of the debt and the value of the mortgage. The defendant objected that the note was not due and payable until 1829, and was not competent evidence to support the count for money had and received. The judge however admitted it, and the jury gave a verdict for the plaintiff for 667 dollars, as the amount of the debt above the value of the mortgage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b476-5\">The defendant moved for a new trial on account of these opinions and the admission of this evidence.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AGe\">Brooks, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ADR\">The original count alleges the</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AVH\">claim to have arisen after the death of the intestate, and the promise to have been made by the defendant personally, so that he would be charged <em>de bonis propriis; </em>the new count alleges the debt to have been due from the intestate in his lifetime, and the promise to have been made by him ; the amendment therefore sets forth a new cause of action, and ought no! to have been allowed. <em>Barry </em>v. Rush, 1 T. R. 691; <em>Jennings </em>v. Newman, 4 T. R. 347 <em>Rose </em>v. Bowler, 1 H.

It was unnecessary to resort to a plea in abatement until the amendment was made, for the defendant before relied on other ground.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b477-5\">The declaration alleges a promise to pay on demand, but the note was not due when the action was commenced. There is therefore a variance. The declaration ought to have been special, setting forth the proceedings before the commissioners.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b477-6\">\n<em>Bigelow, contra,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A1L\">to show that the original and amended counts were for the same cause of action, referred to 1 Chit. Pl. 205; <em>Whitaker </em>v. <em>Whitaker, </em>6 Johns. R. 112; <em>Carter </em>v. <em>Phelps\u2019s Adm. </em>8 Johns. R. 343.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b477-7\">If the service of the writ had become bad in consequence of the amendment, the defendant ought to have been allowed to plead in abatement; but it did not, for the defect was apparent at the first term in the court below ; the defendant was therefore justly required to plead to the merits. <em>Moody </em>v. <em>Blake, </em>6 Mass. R. 459, as corrected in the <em>Advertisement to vol. </em>7.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b477-8\">Demands payable at a future day are to be presented for allowance to the commissioners on an insolvent estate. The statute considers such demands (except where they depend on a contingency) as due at the time of the insolvent\u2019s decease. It is not usual to set out the proceedings before the commissioners, but to give all the facts in evidence. The allegation of a promise to pay on demand is only matter of form, as time does not enter into the substance of the contract. <em>Matthews </em>v. <em>Spicer, 2 </em>Str. 806; <em>Stafford </em>v. <em>Forcer, </em>10 Mod. 313; <em>Cheetham </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>3 Johns. R. 42; <em>Tiffany </em>v. <em>Driggs, </em>13 Johns. R. 253. An action for money had and received resembles a bill in equity, and is not liable to technical objections which might be made to special counts. 2 Stark.
