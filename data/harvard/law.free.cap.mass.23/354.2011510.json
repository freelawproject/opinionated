The <em>third </em>plea was, that no writ or process, upon which the judgment might have been founded, was ever served upon either of the defendants, and that they did not appear and plead to such supposed writ or other process. In the <em>fourth </em>plea the averments of the second and third were united.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A5L\">The replication to these three pleas alleged, among other things, that the plaintiff purchased a writ out of the court in North Carolina, and by virtue thereof the sheriff attached a schooner, the property of the defendants, then lying in North Carolina; that the writ was entered at the May term 1822, of the court, and in pursuance of an order of the court, notice of the process and attachment was published in a newspaper ; that on the 13th of July 1822, one Demille was summoned as garnishee of the defendants, and at the August term he disclosed that he had in his hands a sum of money belonging to the defendants, and the court thereupon ordered the same <em>to be </em>paid over to the plaintiff; that on the 16th of the same July, Cushing &amp; Bonner, merchants in North Carolina, were summoned as garnishees of the defendants, and at the August term they appeared and filed their garnishment; that at the time of the service of the process upon them as garnishees, and until the rendition of the judgment, they were the duly authorized agents of the defendants in relation to the suit; that the defendants had actual and seasonable notice o 1 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>the writ, attachment and other proceedings, and full opportunity to appear and defend against the action, and that they did employ counsel practising in the Court of Pleas, &amp;c. to aid, advise and direct them in regard to the action.</summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"Ahlq\">\n<em>March 28th</em>\n</decisiondate>\n<otherdate data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"ADTq\">\n<em>June 26th.</em>\n</otherdate>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b365-4\">To this replication the defendants demurred specially, assigning as one cause, that it is argumentative, inasmuch as it does not aver that they were residents or inhabitants within the jurisdiction of the Court of Pleas &amp;c. at the commencement or during the pendency of the suit, nor that they were duly served with process, nor that they ever appeared or pleaded,the negative of which facts is directly averred in the pleas, but it avers that the defendants had notice in season to appear and defend the suit, which is no sufficient, direct and positive answer to the averments in the pleas.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b365-5\"><em>Curtis </em>argued in support of the demurrer,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AbS\">and referred to several of the cases cited in <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Williams et al., ante p. </em>232.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b365-6\">\n<em>Cooke, contra,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aer\">relied upon the argument made for the plaintiff in that case.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b365-7\">\n<em>Per Curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"AsSu\">The general principle determined in <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Williams et </em>al.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> applies to the case now before us. It is true the plaintiff has averred that the defendants had notice of the pendency of the original suit, but there was no service of process upon them, and no appearance on their behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-8\">\n<em>Replication adjudged bad.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b365-11\"> See this decision, <em>ante, </em>232, and cases cited in the notes to it.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
