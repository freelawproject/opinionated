The testator kept an ac count of the rent and income of this estate, and of the expenditures upon it, and from time to time made and signed memorandums relating to the same, which were kept in an envelope, on which was written by the testator, \u201c Mrs. Wadsworth\u2019s papers,\u201d in a desk to which the plaintiff had free access; and it was agreed, (if the Court should be of opinion that the same might be given in evidence,) that among the memorandums were the following, <em>viz </em>: \u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AbJ\">One in which the testator, after reciting, that on June 23, 1808, an attorney at law had received of him two notes, one for 52 dollars and 69 cents, dated April 15, 1807, the other for 46 dollars and 85 cents, dated April 15, 1808, given to the testator by E. Curtis \u201c for the rent of the place in Lynn,\u201d and that a suit had been commenced in the name of the attorney upon these notes, and execution obtained, but that only 15 dollars had been paid by Curtis, of which 7 dollars and 89 cents had been applied to the payment of costs, and the remaining 7 dollars and 11 cents had been paid to the testator, he adds, \u201cwhich 7 dollars and 11 cents I have reckoned in my note to Mrs. Wadsworth, it being her property. And should any thing more ever be obtained of those two notes, I hereby testify that it belongs to Mrs. Wadsworth,\u201d &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Adz\">Also a note given to the testator by Nathaniel Farrington, dated March 19, 1824, for 73 dollars and 84 cents, secured by a mortgage, and the following memorandum on the note.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b73-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>\u2018 This note with the mortgage I consider as Mrs. Wads-worth\u2019s, included in a clause of arrears in my last will.

Memorandum. The sum of 663 dollars, 66 cents, includes all the money I have ever received for rent or otherwise belonging to my wife Mary Wadsworth, with interest reckoned annually upon the several payments which unitedly compose said sum to this date, except what I have at her request and for her sole benefit paid to purchase for her Mr. Moulton\u2019s bid, so called, and N. and F. Carnes\u2019s right in her late father and mother\u2019s real estate in Lynn. Benj. Wadsworth.\u201d And raider this the following was written by the testator. \u201c Memorandum. The above sum of 663 dollars, 66 cents, is included in my will.\u201d If in the opinion of the Court the time when the memorandum was made should be material, it was to be ascertained by a jury or by auditors, as the Court might direct.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b73-7\">The\u2019testator died on the 18th of January, 1826. He had made two or tlrree other wills previously, and revoked the same. His real estate was appraised at 3800 dollars, and his personal at 24,172.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b73-8\">If the Court were of opinion that the sum demanded (663 dollars and 66 cents) was bequeathed by the seventh clause of the will, the plaintiff was to recover judgment for that sum with interest; otherwise she was to become nonsuit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b73-9\">The case was argued in writing.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b73-10\"><em>Saltmstall, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AA5\">The question is, whether the sum of 663 dollars, 66 cents, mentioned in the memorandum, is included in the clause of <em>rents in arrear, </em>in the will.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b73-11\">It appears that the testator always kept an account with his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>wife, as he would have done with a stranger ; and that he included in <em>rents in arrear </em>not merely the rent due from the tenants at the time of his decease, (which was less than <em>20 </em>dollars,) but Farrington\u2019s note, &amp;c. given for rent. He states in the memorandum, that he had received the sum of 663 dollars and 66 cents, for rent and otherwise, and adds, \u201c the above sum is included in my will.\u201d In what part of the will is it included ? We contend that the devise and bequest in the first clause are in lieu of dower, or if not wholly so, that the 1000 dollars and the income of the bank shares are from his own property, as a provision for her support. It was his intention to give the sum in question, under the clause of \u201crents in arrear,\u201d &amp;c. and he meant to include all the money he had received from her estate. It was in fact all for rent, except about 10 dollars. That he did not confine the terms \u201c rents in arrear \u201d to their technical meaning, is evident from the memorandum respecting Farrington\u2019s note.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b74-4\">In the case of a will, evidence is admissible to apply its \u25a0terms to the proper objects, as to show what is comprehended within the description of the estate devised. 3 Stark. Ev. *1695, 1013, note 1, 1026 ; 2 Roberts on Wills, (2d ed.) 18, 23, 27. Here the ambiguity arises from something extrinsic, and the admission of evidence is to explain the ambiguity and the intention of the testator. <em>Sargent </em>v. <em>Toione, </em>10 Mass. R. 303, [Rand\u2019s ed. <em>p. </em>307, note (a).]</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b74-5-pl-split\"><em>B. </em>Merrill, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AZ4\">The rules of evidence laid down as to latent ambiguities, are not applicable in the present case. To create such an ambiguity there must be a doubt as to the sense, or some uncertainty as to the signification of the words. If there is no such doubt or uncertainty, paroi evidence is inadmissible. The terms \u201c rents in arrear, \u201d- both in a popular and legal acceptation, have a known, certain, and definite meaning. They mean <em>rents behind </em>\u2014 <em>unpaid </em>\u2014 <em>due from tenant to landlord </em>\u2014 relative terms, which are ap plied without ordinary propriety or precision when used as relative to husband and wife. The evidence offered is not for the purpose of showing the meaning of the words <em>rents in </em>arrear, or rather the amount of <em>rents in arrear on those </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number><em>estates unpaid by the tenant, </em>but to show that the testator intended to bequeath under those terms the 663 dollars, which were not rents in arrear. The admission of this testimony would be adding to the written language, by allowing us to say that a sum of money, the proceeds of <em>rents paid, </em>are <em>rents in arrear. Brown </em>v. <em>Selwin, </em>Cas. Temp. Talb. 240, 242, note ; <em>S. C. 4 </em>Bro. P. C. 180; <em>Ulrich </em>v. <em>Litchfield, </em>2 Atk. 372; <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Sill, </em>11 Johns. Rep. 213, 215; Roberts on Fr. 15; 3 Campb. 57, Howe\u2019s note; <em>Richards </em>v. <em>Dutch, </em>8 Mass. Rep. 514; 3 Stark. Ev. 1008, 1010, 1011; <em>[Farrar </em>v. <em>Ayres, </em>5 Pick. 409.]</p>\n<otherdate data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b75-12\">April term 1828</otherdate>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b75-8\">Even if the evidence offered by the plaintiff could be admitted, it would be inconsequential and barren. For, 1. it is vague, loose, and uncertain. 2. If the memorandums are regarded as testamentary papers, they are revoked by the will, being of prior date. 3. The plaintiff would contend, that the memorandum dated April 1, 1824, proves that the sum of 663 dollars is the sum bequeathed by the words \u201c all rents in arrear on the estates in Lynn,\u201d when it cannot be overlooked, that the testator, in that memorandum, proceeds to describe that sum as including \u201c all the money I have ever received for rent <em>or otherwise, </em>belonging to my wife M. W., with interest reckoned annually upon the several payments which <em>unitedly compose </em>said sum,\u201d &amp;c. So that instead of proving that this sum is for rents in arrear, or for rents received, it proves the contrary. 4. The testator remarks, \u201c the above sum of 663 dollars, 66 cents, is <em>included </em>in my willthe meaning of which is, that in his will he had bequeathed to the plaintiff a sum equivalent; and it is immaterial whether these words were written by him before or after making his will of August 1, 1825 ; if written since, his meaning was, that the legacy of 1000 dollars included all the moneys he had ever received for her. 5. These memorandums by the testator were obviously intended as calculations, mere chalk, to satisfy and explain to his wife the extent of her pecuniary claims on him before he made his will. By the will he reimbursed all.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b75-10\">The opinion of the Court was drawn up by</p>\n<author id=\"b75-11\">Parker C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"ASa\">The clause in the will under which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>plaintiff claims 663 dollars and 66 cents as a legacy to hei, is \u2122 the following words.\u2014\u201c Seventhly, 1 bequeath to my said wife the money she may have in her possession at the time of my decease, and all rents in arrear on the real, estates at Lynn.\u201d If the Court can look dehors the will to ascertain what was intended by the testator by the words \u201c all rents in arrear,\u201d &amp;c. it would be very clear, by the memorandum on the envelope, indorsed \u201c Mrs. Wadsworth\u2019s pa pers,\u201d dated April 1, 1824, that he intended to give the sum there specified as the proceeds of her real estate, the rent of which he had received; for in an additional memorandum he says, \u201c the above sum of 663 dollars and 66 cents is included in my will.\u201d There being no date to this latter memorandum, it is to be presumed that it was made after the will, and was occasioned by some provision respecting rents made therein ; and these words in the will, \u201c all rents in arrear,\u201d &amp;c. might reasonably be referred to' the amount of rents of which the account is stated in the mem orandum. And although the whole of the sum mentioned in the memorandum should not have been received by him specifically from rents, taking the will and the memorandum together, there could be no doubt he intended to give her that sum.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">But it is insisted by the executor, that there is no ambiguity in the clause, and therefore we are not at liberty to seek for a construction dehors the will. <em>Rents in arrear on the real estates in </em>Lynn, are, it is said, perfectly definite words, and there being a trifling sum of rent due from the tenant, at the decease of the testator, it must be intended the clause related to that only. The position is true, and well supported by the authorities, that extrinsic matter is not to be resorted to, when the meaning of the testator can be come at in the will itself, or when the words used themselves con stitute a legacy or devise, there being no uncertainty as to the person who is to take, or as to the thing bequeathed. We think, however, there is an ambiguity in the words used, which wifi justify an explanation by extrinsic matter, and particularly by the words used by the testator himself in memoranda written and signed by him. We are obliged to sup <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>pose, in justice to the character of the testator, that he intended, in the clause in question, a bounty to his wife out of property belonging to himself. We presume also, from the scrupulous management of his wife\u2019s property, that he believed that all rents unpaid at the time of his death, accruing from real estate belonging to her, by law survived to her, and became her sole property, without any gift from him. That such is the law in the case of leasehold estates belonging to the wife, unless the rent was secured by a lease made by the husband alone with the tenant, in which it was stipulated that the rent should be paid to him, is very clear. See Com. Dig. <em>Baron and </em>Feme, <em>F </em>1, and the cases there cited ; also 1 Roper\u2019s Husband and Wife, 170, <em>et seq.; </em>Chamber on Leases, 221 ; and it is quite likely Mr. Wads-worth supposed the law to be the same in regard to his interest in his wife\u2019s estate. By the bequest then of rents in arrear on the estate in Lynn, which was her property, he could not have intended rents unpaid by the tenant, for we ought not to suppose he made a pretence of giving to her, what he had reason to think was already hers. What then did he mean by rents in arrear ? He has himself explained it, and very satisfactorily. He had received rert during the coverture from her real estate. This he had a right to do, and to appropriate to his own use ; but he kept an exact account with his wife, meaning conscientiously to restore all which he thought belonged equitably to her, though legally to him, and this he intended to do by his last will, and this he did. He gives her all the money in her possession at the time of his decease, and all the rents in arrear on the real estates at Lynn. By rents in arrear he meant the sums he had received and kept an account of, as belonging equitably to his wife ; rent in arrear to her, which he had not paid her, but kept on hand for her; and he further says, \u201c the above sum is included in my will.\u201d How is it included, unless in the clause giving her the rents in arrear ? It is supposed by the defendant\u2019s counsel, that it is included in the . legacy of 1000 dollars ; but on recurring to the clause giving that legacy, and the other provisions made for her out of his personal estate, it is manifest he considered all this an equiv<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>aient for the legal claims she might have for a sufficient provision 111 his real estate in the form of dower. That the testator used the words \u201c renta in arrear \u201d in an untechnical and inartificial manner, is evident from the memorandum in relation to a note given by Nathaniel Farrington, March 19, 1824, secured by a mortgage. The memorandum is, \u201c This note, with the mortgage, I consider as Mrs. Wadsworth\u2019s, included in a clause of arrears in my last will.\u201d There is no clause in the will which contains the word <em>arrears, </em>except the one under consideration, and it was necessary to look dehors the will to ascertain what was meant by the terms, <em>rents in arrear, </em>on this subject. The testator certainly meant that this note should go to his wife, and so the executor considered' it, for he has delivered it to her. Why then should not the money which he kept an account of as accruing from rents, pass to her in the same clause, when he says, at the foot of the memorandum, \u201c the above sum is included in my will \u201d ?</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">If it be said, that the devise to her in the first clause of the will, of all his right and interest in the real estate of her father and mother, shows that he did not understand the rules of property, and therefore that he intended to give her only what was already hers, under the phrase <em>rents in arrear, </em>it is a sufficient answer, that he appears to have had some interest in that real estate, purchased of Thacher, which was the object of that devise. We are satisfied, therefore, that it is right to look into these memoranda, in order to find out the meaning of the terms <em>rents in arrear, </em>for the reasons above stated ; and that by those words he meant to give her the sum included in the memorandum, as the amount re ceived as rents on her estate.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b78-8\">\n<em>Defendant defaulted.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b78-9\"> See 2 Stark.
