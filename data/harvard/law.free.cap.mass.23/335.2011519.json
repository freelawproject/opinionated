He further deposed, that he made the contracts personally with the shippers of goods, including the plaintiffs ; that the defendant gave him no orders whatever about the destination or employment of the vessel at any time ; and that he had requested the deponent to write to him from time to time to let him know where the vessel was, where the deponent was going, and what his business was.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b346-6\">A verdict was taken for the defendant, subject to the opinion of the whole Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"APzc\"><em>F. Dexter </em>and <em>Washburn, </em>for the plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A8TG\">The deposition of Snow cannot be admitted to vary or explain the written contract between him and Winsor. This contract was not a charter-party, but Snow was the agent of Winsor. The vessel was not under the general control of Snow, for he was re stricted to the business of freighting. No period was limited during which he was to have the vessel, and Winsor might have interfered at any time and dissolved the contract. All the acts done by Snow were within the scope of his authority as master. He had no power to appoint another person master ; which is essential to a hiring. The share of the earnings which he was to receive, was merely a mode of paying his wages. If he had suffered the vessel to remain idle for several months, he would hav.e been subject to an action for want of due diligence. In <em>Taggard </em>v. <em>Loring, </em>16 Mass. R. 336, Jennings had the control of the vessel for a given period. He did not stand to the owner in the relation of master, and lie might have appointed any other person master. In <em>Reynolds </em>v. <em>Toppan, </em>15 Mass. R. 370, the vessel was \u201c let and chartered\u201d to Marshall for \u201c the season.\u201d He was to employ her on his own account' and at his own expense, and ne might have appointed another master, and the vessel was not a freighting ship By \u00a7 3 of <em>St. </em>1818, c. 122, limiting me <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>responsibility of ship-owners, \u201c the charterer of any vessel, in case he shall navigate her <em>at his own expense, </em>shall be considered the owner, within the meaning of this act.\u201d This vessel was navigated partly at the expense of the defendant. <em>Clark-son </em>v. <em>Edes, </em>4 Cowen, 480 ; <em>Parish </em>v. <em>Crawford, </em>Abbott (3d ed.), 21 ; <em>Fletcher </em>v. <em>Braddick, </em>5 Bos. &amp; Pul. 182.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b347-4\">The agreement was a contract of partnership. Snow and Winsor were to participate in the profits as such, and were entitled to an account one from the other. Both therefore are liable for the breach of the contract with the plaintiffs, and the non-joinder of Snow not having been pleaded in abatement, the action will be sustained against Winsor alone.

Loring, contra.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AV3e\">The criterion of chartering is having the exclusive possession and control of the vessel, free from any right of the owner to interfere. Here Snow was to get the freight himself. There was no limitation as to the prices for which he should carry goods, or the places to which he should proceed. He was to victual and man the vessel at his own expense. The stipulation that Winsor should pay \u201c eight dollars per month for one man\u2019s wages,\u201d was not a contract to pay wages, but merely to pay eight dollars a month. <em>Vallejo v. Wheeler, </em>Cowp. 143; <em>James </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>3 Esp. R. 27; <em>Trinity House </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>4 Maule &amp; Selw. 288; <em>Saville </em>v. <em>Campion, </em>2 Barn. &amp; Aid. 503; <em>Frazer </em>v. <em>Marsh, </em>13 East, 238; <em>M'Intyre </em>v. <em>Bowne, </em>1 Johns. R. 229; <em>Marcardier </em>v. <em>Chesapeake Ins. Co. </em>8 Cranch, 39; <em>Hallet </em>v. <em>Col. Ins. Co. </em>8 Johns. R. 209; <em>Reynolds </em>v. <em>Toppan </em>and <em>Taggard </em>v. <em>Loring </em>before cited. It is objected that no time was fixed for Snow\u2019s retaining the vessel ; but in this respect the contract is like a lease at will, and Winsor could not put an end to it without reasonable notice. It is objected, too, that the vessel was restricted to freighting; but this is not in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>consistent with chartering, any more than a stipulation that a house shall be used as a tavern, is inconsistent with a lease. Snow, it is said, could not have appointed another master; so a tenant at will cannot underlet. To show that Snow had not the control of the vessel, it was remarked that he would have been liable to an action if he had let her lie idle. This is true, and the reason is, that it was agreed she should be employed in freighting ; but Snow might use her as he pleased in that business.</p>\n<otherdate data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b348-5\">\n<em>June 26th.</em>\n</otherdate>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b348-8\">As a general rule, an agreement to share profits constitutes a partnership, but there are exceptions. Here however there was no division of profits, but of the gross earnings. If the voyage were long, Snow might lose while Winsor would gain. A division of net earnings would make a partnership. <em>Dry </em>v. <em>Boswell, </em>1 Campb. 329; <em>Mair </em>v. <em>Glennie, </em>4 Maule &amp; Selw. 343; <em>Rice </em>v. <em>Austin, </em>17 Mass.

R. 182; <em>Baxter </em>v. <em>Rod man, </em>3 Pick. 435.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b348-9\"><em>Dexter, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ApSt\">In regard to Snow\u2019s being authorized to go where he pleased, it is common for the owner to authorize the master to proceed according to his discretion on a freighting voyage. The sum of eight dollars per month is stipulated to be paid as the average rate of wages, and it is wages <em>eo nomine. </em>Admit the contract to be like a lease at will, and that Snow was entitled to reasonable notice, Winsor could put him out immediately for misconduct; and in this the case at bar differs from <em>Taggard </em>v. <em>Boring.</em></p>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b348-10\">Parker C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AHt\">In the case of <em>Reynolds </em>v. <em>Toppan, </em>15 Mass. R. 370, it was determined, that the owner of a vessel under charter, the hirer having the whole control of the vessel for the time, to victual and man her and pay over a portion of the net proceeds to the owner for the use of the vessel, was not liable to the shippers of goods on board the vessel, which had been embezzled or otherwise not accounted <em>eor </em>by the master.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In that case the English authorities cited on the present occasion were duly considered by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>Court and therefore will not be commented upon : and in the case of <em>Taggard et al. </em>v. <em>Loving, </em>16 Mass. R. <em>336, </em>the same principle is recognised, and is applied to a contrac of lure of the vessel which existed only in paroi. So that the inquiry in the present case can be only, whether there exist any circumstances which distinguish it from those which have been thus decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-3\">And first it is insisted, that in the cases decided, the letting the vessel was for a certain determinate period ; in one case for six months, and in the other for the season ; whereas in the present case there is no provision for the duration or the termination of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">It is not perceived that any difference in regard to the liability of the parties can result from this circumstance, for although the contract was determinable at the will of the owner of the vessel, yet, as in other contracts of a similar nature, this right is subject to the qualification, that it could not be rescinded while the vessel was actually employed in business pursuant to the contract ; so that it was an absolute and indefeasible hiring of the vessel for every voyage she should have undertaken until notice was given by the owner of his intention to discontinue it.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">The principle of ownership <em>pro hac vice </em>by the hirer would apply to every voyage undertaken by him before he should receive notice from the owner that he chose to terminate the contract. For this we cite no authority, for no case like the present has been found ; but it results from the nature of the contract and the rights of the party under it, and is analogous to the case of leases at will of real estate, which cannot be terminated but by mutual consent, unless the lessor gives reasonable notice to quit.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">It is also thought that the clause in the agreement, which provides that the defendant, the owner, shall be accountable for the wages of one man at eight dollars per month, constitutes a substantial difference between this and the cases decided ; but, on reflection, we consider this only as a means of ascertaining the charges upon the earnings before a division shall be made between the charterer and the owner. It is no more than if the parties had agreed that the earnings should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>be divided, except that eight dollars per month should be deducted from the defendant\u2019s share.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">As to the question of copartnership between the defend ant and Snow in the' employment and earnings of the vessel, we think it cannot be predicated on the facts appearing in this case, any more than in all the cases in which the char-er of the vessel was agreed to be paid by a portion of the-earnings. <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">\n<em>Judgment according to verdict</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b348-12\"> See Revised Stat <em>c. </em>39, \u00a7 3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b350-14\"> See <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Hamilton, </em>12 Pick. 428; <em>Perry </em>v. <em>Oshorne, 5 </em>Pick.
