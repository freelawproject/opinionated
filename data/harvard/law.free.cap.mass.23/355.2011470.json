At the trial the defendant produced several notes made to ll m by Whiting, which he offered to set off against the note in suit ; but the Court now <em>held </em>that they could not be allow-ea, as they had not been regularly filed in set-off, pursuant to the statute. A new trial was however granted, that the defend-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>out might have an opportunity to show that they were given as evidences of payment of the note in suit.
