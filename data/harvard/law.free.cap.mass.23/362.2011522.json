The counts were <em>quantum valebant </em>for goods sold, and <em>indebitatus assumpsit </em>for money laid out and expended, money lent, and money had and received. In each count was alleged a promise by the defendant to the testator on the 31st of December, 1804. A bill of particulars was filed by the plaintiff in the form of an account current, embracing charges from April 11, 1800, to November 26, 1804, and credits from July 2, 1802, to December 31, 1804.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b373-6\">The defendant pleaded <em>non assumpsit infra sex annos. </em>The plaintiff replied, that at the time, &amp;c. the testator and the defendant were merchants, the defendant residing in Bordeaux, in France, and the testator in Boston, and that the causes of action arose out of the mutual dealings and accounts of the defendant and the testator as merchants, and wholly concerned the trade of merchandise carried on between them.

In several it has been held, that where there has been a cessation of mutual dealings between the parties for six years, the statute is a bar ; but that a charge within that period draws after it others of longer standing. In a case in New York (5 Johns. Ch. R. 522,) Chancellor <em>Kent </em>reviews the authorities, and comes to the conclusion, that merchants\u2019 accounts are within the statute, where there is no item within six years. In 5 Cranch, 15, the court maintain the contrary doctrine. As the language of the statute is clear, we shall ground our decision upon it. The words are, <em>\u201c </em>all actions of account, and upon the case, <em>other than </em>such accounts as concern the trade of merchandise, between merchant and merchant, their factors or servants,\u201d shall be commenced within the time limited. Such accounts then are not at all within the statute. This is the most natural construction, and indeed the only one which the words will allow.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">\n<em>Plea adjudged bad.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b374-7\"> See <em>Union Bank </em>v. <em>Knapp, </em>3 Pick.
