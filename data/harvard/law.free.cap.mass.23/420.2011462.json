Upon a demand made to state an account of the rents and profits, the defendant rendered one forthwith, in which he charged about 34 dollars for disbursements ; of which sum an auditor appointed in the suit disallowed about 5 dollars.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b430-13\"><em>C.
