The general issue only was pleaded. Judgment was rendered for the defendant, and the plaintiff appealed. Upon the trial in the Court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>Common Pleas the plaintiff proved the alleged trespass, and the defendant offered evidence to prove that at the time of the trespass the plaintiff was not in possession of the land. <em>Strong </em>J. rejected this evidence, on the ground that it brought in question the title to real estate, and so was precluded by <em>St. </em>1783, c. 42, \u00a7 2, [See Revised Stat. c. 85, \u00a7 1,] and this Court were of the same opinion. The judgment of the court below was accordingly affirmed.</summary>\n<attorneys id=\"b430-8\"><em>Dwight </em>and <em>Kellogg, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b430-9\"><em>Hubbard </em>and <em>Bishop, </em>for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p id=\"AbU\">cited <em>Taylor </em>v <em>Townsend, </em>8 Mass.
