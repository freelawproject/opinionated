If this evidence ought to have been excluded, the plaintiff was to become nonsuit.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b528-9\"><em>J. Mills </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A-6z\">Our first objection to the paroi evidence is, that it contradicts the deed. The consideration stated in the deed is 1100 dollars ; but the evidence proves that the agreement to convey was the actual consideration. 3 Stark. Ev. 1004 ; <em>Schermerhorn </em>v. Vanderheyden, 1 Johns. R. 139; <em>Howes </em>v. Barker, 3 Johns. R. 506; <em>Maigley </em>v. Hauer, 7 Johns. R. 341.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b528-10\">The first and third counts set out a sale, but the proof is that there was no sale ; which is a variance. 1 Chit. PI. 299. The second count is not supported, as no money was received by the defendant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b528-11\">The contract proved is within the statute of frauds. <em>St. </em>1783, c. 37, \u00a7 2, 3; <em>Flint </em>v. Sheldon, 13 Mass. R. 448; <em>Boyd </em>v. <em>Stone, </em>11 Mass. R. 342.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b528-12\"><em>Dewey </em>and <em>Blair, </em>for the plaintiff,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"APn\">contended that although the contract was originally within the statute of frauds, yet as a substantial part of it had been performed, the defendant was not at liberty to treat the whole transaction as a nullity. , The statute does not declare contracts not in writing for the sale of land, and all that may be done in pursuance of them, to be void ; it only prohibits actions being brought to enforce them. The action before the Court is not to compel a conveyance, but to recover the value of the land. It proceeds upon the ground, that the special contract has been rescinded. If such is the fact, it is unnecessary to set out the original contract. <em>Gillet </em>v. <em>Maynard, </em>5 Johns. R. 85; <em>Towers </em>v. <em>Barrett, </em>I T.
