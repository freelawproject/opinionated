The replication stated, as a breach of the bond, that the real estate was sold subject to the widow\u2019s right to dower, when in fact she had, in the lifetime of the intestate, released her dower. The defendants rejoined that she had not released her dower ; upon which issue was joined.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b426-14\">At the trial, before <em>Putnam </em>J., it was proved, that on the 11th of January, 1820, one Pyncheon conveyed the real estate to T. Griswold, who on the same day mortgaged it to Pyncheon to secure the payment of 2100 dollars. On the 22d of May, 1822, T. Griswold made a mortgage to S. Gris-wold to secure the payment of 1216 dollars, and in this last deed the widow released her dower. On the 24th of the same May the first mortgage was discharged.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b426-15\">Under the instructions of the judge a verdict was found foi the defendants, subject to the opinion of the whole Court,</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"A77h\"><em>Hubbard </em>and <em>Nash </em>contended that a woman is not dowa <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>ole of an equity of redemption ;</attorneys>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b427-15\"><em>Sept </em>10th</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AzV\">and that the intesta e had only an instantaneous seisin, and so his widow was not entitled to dower.

Griswold, in which the widow had released her dower. This release was co-extensive with the mortgage ; it extended no further ; and consequently the right of dower continued, subject only to that incumbrance.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">\n<em>Judgment according to verdict.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b427-9\"> See <em>Cass </em>v.
