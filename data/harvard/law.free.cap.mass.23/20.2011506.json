They further stated, that they had contracted for working and finishing the road.</summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AaS\">Nov. 10th.</decisiondate>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b29-3\"><em>Saltonstall </em>and <em>Gerrish </em>insisted,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AI_\">that the commissioners had no authority to re-assess the damages. A debt had become due to the owner of the land from the town ; it was a vested right, and an attempt by the legislature to make one corporation liable for the debt of another, would be unconstitutional. The intention of <em>St. </em>1825, c. 171, in relation to roads located but not worked, is merely that the commissioners shall complete what the Court of Sessions have left unfinished. Suppose the town had paid the damages assessed, must the county pay them over again upon a re-assessment ?</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b29-5\">Proctor, for the petitioners,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ArO\">cited <em>Gedney </em>v. <em>Tewksbury, </em>3 Mass.

So that the jurisdiction of the Court ol Sessions over it was transferred to the commissioners, and it became their duty, in order that the damages might be paid by the county, as is required by the statute, to estimate the damages anew, and certify the same, as is prescribed. The statute above referred to having been repealed, and the powers of the commissioners having been transferred to a new tribunal not yet constituted, it became necessary to ascertain whether there was any provision for cases pending under the repealed statute ; and we find there is the most full and explicit provision for a continuance of authority in the commissioners appointed under the repealed statute, in regard to all cases relating to roads which had not been finally and conclusively acted upon by them. <em>St. </em>1827, c. 77. We are to treat the com missioners then, in the same manner as if the last statute had not passed ; and they having shown no sufficient cause for neglecting to estimate the damages, a peremptory mandamus must isSue, to enforce the execution of their duty as set forth in the proceedings in this case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b30-7\"> See <em>Boxford </em>v. <em>County Commissioners of Essex County, 7 </em>Pick. 337 <em>Springfield </em>v. <em>County Commissioners of </em>Hampden, 10 Pick. 59.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
