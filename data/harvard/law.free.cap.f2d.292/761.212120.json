When the night manager found that he could not leave the premises at the required hour to carry out this agreement, the hostess made inquiries among the other employees and arranged for appellant\u2019s transportation with another waitress whose husband was calling for her at approximately 1:30 a. m. En route the car was involved in an intersection collision with a vehicle driven by appellee Kittredge. Appellant brought this action against both appellees and the jury returned a verdict for the appellees. The appeal is taken from the denial of the appellant\u2019s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-4\">We find no error with respect to the judgment for appellee Kittredge. The case was submitted to the jury on disputed evidence and the instructions with respect to the liability of Kittredge adequately stated the relevant law.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\"> Appellee Hot Shoppes contends that appellant is limited to the remedy under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act of the District of Columbia, D.C.Code \u00a7 36-501 <em>(1951), </em>which adopts the provisions of the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, 33 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 901-950, as amended, 33 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 907-933. The District Court submitted to the jury the question whether appellant was in the course of her employment and thus relegated to her remedy under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act. This was error because the applicability of the law is a question for the court. Since the jury returned a general verdict for appellee, we have no way of knowing whether the fact finders reached their conclusion because they believed, as it was submitted to them, that the Act was the exclusive remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">However, the record before us is sufficient for us to determine that the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act is the exclusive remedy. Cf. United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co. v. Donovan, 1954, 94 U.S.App.D.C. 377, 221 F.2d 515. Hence the judgment for appellee Hot Shoppes is, on that ground</p>\n<p id=\"Ar7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
