We have carefully considered this ground of appeal and find that the trial court, who tried the case without a jury by consent of the parties, permitted the defendant to take the stand to testify on the issue of the legality of a seizure of' the property tendered in evidence by the Government. The examination of the defendant in this connection was relevant to the issue on which the defendant sought to give testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-24\">In our opinion we referred to \u201cthe jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d The opinion is modified to strike the words \u201cthe jury\u2019s verdict,\u201d and to substitute in lieu thereof the word \u201cjudgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b440-25\">As thus modified the motion for rehearings is</p>\n<p id=\"b440-26\">Denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
