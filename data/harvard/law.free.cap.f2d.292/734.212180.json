The court held, in a memorandum opinion, that the Commission\u2019s order, directing the transit company to transfer $613,661.28 of the proceeds of the sale of property, from its earned surplus account to three different accounts, was not unreasonable, arbitrary or capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-12\">Sections 43-310 and 43-314, D.C.Code (1951), confer broad discretion upon the Public Utilities Commission in regulating the accounting procedures of utility companies under its jurisdiction. Our function in reviewing the Commission\u2019s orders and decisions is limited to questions of law, including constitutiona1 questions; and the Commission\u2019s findings of fact are conclusive unless it appears that the findings are unreasonable, arbitrary, or capricious. D.C.Code \u00a7 43-706 (1951). We find no error on the part of the District Court in determining that the Commission\u2019s order of September 30, 1959, was not unreasonable, arbitrary or capricious. We see no constitutional question involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-16\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
