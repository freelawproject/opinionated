phosphorous oxychloride and thionyl chloride.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1004-4\">All claims were rejected on the ground that the claimed compounds, and therefore the processes by which they are made, have not been shown to have \u201cutility\u201d within the meaning of the applicable statute (35 U.S.C. \u00a7 101); and claims 1 and 2 were further rejected on the ground that the compounds which they recite are unpatentable in view of the prior art. The references relied on are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1004-5\">Everett et al., Journal of the Chem. Soc. (London) 1949, Part III, pages 1972 to 1983; Harper et al. \u2014 Chem. Abstracts Vol. 45 (1951) Col. 7193.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1004-6\">The rejection of claims 1 and 2 on prior art will be considered first. The compounds defined by those claims are, respectively, p-Bis- (2-chloroethyl)-amin-ophenylalanine and its laevo isomer. The Harper et al. reference discloses p-diethylamino-phenylalanine. The examiner states that the compound of claims 1 and 2 is \u201ca chlorine analog\u201d of the Harper et al. compound, by which he apparently means that a part of the hydrogen of the Harper et al. compound is replaced by chlorine to form the claimed compounds. The examiner further noted that Everett et al. disclose compounds generally similar to those claimed by appellants and prepared by chlorination, and propose the use of such compounds in anti-tumor therapy. On the basis of those statements, which appear to be correct, the examiner concluded that the compounds of claims 1 and 2 represent \u201cmerely an expected modification of the Harper et al. compounds when viewed in the light of the Everett et al. teaching * * *.\u201d The same position was taken by the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-7\">The portion of the Everett et al. disclosure which is principally relied on in support of the rejection is the statement that \u201cMany aryldi-(2 halogenoethyl) amines * * * show interesting biological properties, notably an inhibiting effect on the growth of certain transplantable rat tumors.\u201d The group of compounds thus recited is quite large, and Everett et al. do not indicate that all, or even most of them, have the stated property. Their disclosure, therefore, cannot properly be taken as a suggestion to prepare and test every conceivable compound of the group. It is true that Harper et al. disclose compounds which, by the substitution of chlorine, a halogen, for part of the hydrogen, may be converted to the compounds recited in appealed claims 1 and 2, but, in our opinion, such conversion would not be obvious in the absence of any suggestion in the prior art as to why it should be made. The examiner and the board were of the opinion that such a suggestion is found in the statement by Everett et al. that many of the halogen compounds to which they refer have an inhibiting effect on rat tumors. That might be more tenable if there were anything to lead one to suppose that the Harper et al. compounds had any tumor inhibiting tendency. In that case, the disclosure of Everett et al. that halogenated compounds of the same general class inhibited tumors might suggest the desirability of incorporating a halogen in the Harper et al. compounds, with a view of increasing that effect. However, the only use to which Harper et al. refer in connection with p-diethylamino-phenylalanine is as metabolic antagonist for the <em>bacillus enconostoc mesenteroids, </em>and even for that purpose they state that none of the compounds tested was inhibitory. We fail to see anything in that disclosure to suggest that the compounds disclosed, or any others based on them, would be likely to inhibit the growth of tumors in rats.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-10\"> On this record, we find nothing which would suggest any combination of the disclosures of Everett et al. and Harper et al. to produce the compounds claimed here. The mere fact that it is <em>possible </em>to find two isolated disclosures which might be combined in such a way to produce a new compound does not necessarily render such production obvious unless the art also contains something to suggest the desirability of the proposed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"957\">*957</page-number>combination. The board\u2019s rejection on the prior art is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-5\">The board\u2019s second ground of rejection is on lack of \u201cutility.\u201d Appellants\u2019 assertion of utility is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1005-6\">\u201cThis invention relates to chemotherapeutic agents and has as an object to provide an improved compound having tumour growth inhibitory action and process for the manufacture thereof.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1005-7\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1005-8\">\u201cThe L form has greater tumour growth inhibitory action than either the D form or the racemic form. <em>All forms are, however, effective tumour growth inhibitors when tested against transplanted Walker rat carcinoma.\u201d </em>(Emphasis ours.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1005-9\">In support of its rejection the board reasoned that \u201cprotection of rats, or mice, from the growth of cancer, specifically transplanted Walker rat carcinoma, is not in itself a sufficient usefulness within the purview of the patent statutes * * further stating that \u201cthe elimination of rodents themselves would seem to be a more desirable objective.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-10\">Presumably, therefore, if the instant compounds were intended to poison rats their utility would not have been questioned. The board\u2019s premise that the compounds are designed to \u201cprotect rats or mice from the growth of cancer,\u201d or, as stated by the same board in companion appeal, Patent Appeal No. 6666, that \u201cthe continued disease-free existence of rodents is not a desirable objective\u201d is not tenable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-11\">Much the same question was raised when the companion proceeding was before the examiner. In their brief on appeal to the board there, appellants urged that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1005-12\">\u201cApplicants have shown, particularly in the aforesaid copending application Serial No. 415,964, that the L form has great utility in the treatment of rat carcinoma and thus unquestionably has pharmacological utility. The Examiner gives this no weight on the ground that the successful treatment of rat carcinoma is not to be considered as utility. It has been explained, however, that all chemotherapeutic agents are first used pharmacologically on animals prior to their use in clinical cases. The use of the compounds produced by the present process on rats has been outstandingly successful and results have been achieved which have not been approximated before. This is clearly utility because if a failure was made in the pharmacological tests, then lack of utility would be shown and the compounds in question would be discarded and not tried on human patients. The Examiner\u2019s position, therefore, fails to take into account not only the standard practice involved with new chemotherapeutic agents, but further overlooks the highly significant fact that pharmacological success must precede clinical trials.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1005-14\">Further elaboration of appellants\u2019 objective is found in their brief to this court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1005-15\">\u201cIt is submitted that the Board of Appeals was in error in holding that the inhibition of tumors in rats or mice is not in itself a utility within the purview of 35 U.S.C. 101, since the continued disease-free existence of rodents is not considered a desirable objective. This is a rather extraordinary statement which misconstrues Appellants\u2019 invention and raises a fallacious issue. Appellants are not concerned with the health or existence of rodents as such but are only concerned with the rodents as a means for testing their new compounds. The holding of the Board of Appeals overlooks the widespread practice of carrying out pharmacological work in animals as a screening procedure, and of the many thousands of new drugs tested each year, only a very few successfully pass the pharmacological animal tests. This success is a plain indication of utility and indicates that the particular drug can then be clin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"958\">*958</page-number>ically tested. The rodents are usually sacrificed after the tests and given post-morten examination thereby revealing much useful information. There are many animal farms and laboratories which specialize in the raising and supplying of rodents for just such purposes and it is not understood why the position should be taken that rodents should be completely eliminated. This may be \u2022quite true insofar as certain aspects of rodent infestation are involved in large cities, for example, but frankly such <em>as </em>no bearing upon the present appeal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1006-4\">The pertinent statutory provisions for .so-called \u201cutility\u201d is found in Title 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 101 which reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1006-5\">\u201c101. Inventions patentable</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AAE\">\u201cWhoever invents or discovers any new and <em>useful </em>process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, or any new and <em>useful </em>improvement thereof, may obtain a patent therefor, subject to the conditions and requirements of this title.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1006-6\">That appellants\u2019 compounds actually do inhibit the growth of the transplanted \u2022cancer strain is not questioned. In our opinion that achievement is sufficient to \u25a0satisfy the express language of Section 101, and is in harmony with the basic constitutional concept of promoting the progress of science and the useful arts.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1006-7\">Our conclusion is influenced by a background of common knowledge that cancer is one of the dreadest of all diseases; that for years untold measures of time, talent, and treasure have been devoted to a search for means to prevent its spread and discover a cure; and that as of now those measures have been largely unsuccessful.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-8\">We are familiar with the cases cited by counsel but find none of them sufficiently in point to be controlling. Those decisions are based on those facts, just as our decision here is based on the instant facts, and should not be construed as laying down a sweeping principle that any and all compounds are in and of themselves \u201cuseful.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-13\">The decision is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-14\">Reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-15\">KIRKPATRICK, J., sat but did not participate in decision.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1006-9\">.
