Wham of the district court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b394-26\">In this court, his counsel\u2019s brief treats petitioner\u2019s motion to vacate judgment and sentence as based upon 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255. The brief of counsel for the gov-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>eminent considers the motion as arising under \u00a7 2255 or as a petition for writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">The government relies upon the proposition of law that a plea of guilty admits all the material facts alleged in the indictment, citing Hoover v. United States, 10 Cir., 268 F.2d 787, and United States v. Hoyland, 7 Cir., 264 F.2d 346. Reliance is also placed upon the proposition that, after a conviction on a plea of guilty, validly accepted by the trial judge, the appellant cannot assert errors in the conduct of the trial, as the sentence is based on the plea, not on the evidence. Cited are United States v. Miller, 2 Cir., 254 F.2d 523; Armpriester v. United States, 4 Cir., 256 F.2d 294; United States v. Hoyland, supra; and United States v. Morin, 3 Cir., 265 F.2d 241.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">While we are confronted in this case, as in many cases originating with prisoners in penal institutions, with an awkward presentation of claims, we believe a fair appraisement of petitioner\u2019s contentions reveals that the totality of the relevant circumstances leading to his plea of guilty is of such nature that he is entitled to have his motion disposed of on a finding of facts after a hearing in which the district court considers such relevant evidence, including petitioner\u2019s testimony'in person, as the parties may offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">In United States v. Hayman, 342 U.S. 205, 212, 72 S.Ct. 263, 268, 96 L.Ed. 232, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-7\">\u201cUnder the 1867 Act, United States District Courts have jurisdiction to determine whether a prisoner has been deprived of liberty in violation of constitutional rights, although the proceedings resulting in incarceration may be unassailable on the face of the record. Under that Act, a variety of allegations have been held to permit challenge of convictions on facts <em>dehors </em>the record.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b395-10\">The record before us fails to show that the district court considered any facts <em>dehors </em>the record which bore on the merits of petitioner\u2019s claim to relief. Waley v. Johnston, 316 U.S. 101, 104, 62 S.Ct. 964, 86 L.Ed. 1302. When such a hearing is held the court will be in a position to apply the principle announced in Kercheval v. United States, 274 U.S. 220, 223, 47 S.Ct. 582, 583, 71 L.Ed. 1009, that \u201ca plea of guilty shall not be accepted unless made voluntarily after proper advice and with full understanding of the consequences.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b395-11\">We are not in accord with the contention of government counsel that, in effect, a plea of guilty eradicates the effect of all prior invasions of defendant\u2019s constitutional rights. See Commonwealth of Pennsylvania ex rel. Herman v. Claudy, 350 U.S. 116, 118, note 2, 76 S.Ct. 223, 100 L.Ed. 126.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-12\">For these reasons, the order from which petitioner has appealed is reversed and this cause is remanded to the district court for further proceedings not inconsistent with the views herein expressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-13\">In this court able and diligent services have been rendered on behalf of petitioner by William M. McGovern, Jr., who was appointed by this court to represent him. We express our appreciation for Mr. McGovern\u2019s efforts as court-appointed counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-14\">Reversed and remanded with directions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b394-16\">. The district court stated that it considered this motion \u201cas another petition\u201d. Accordingly we refer to Shelton as \u201cpetitioner\u201d and appellee as \u201crepondent\u201d.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b394-27\">. The first petition was filed September 4, 1956, and denied September 20, 1956, by Judge Wham. This order was affirmed. United States v. Shelton, 7 Cir., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>249 F.2d 871. The second petition was filed July 14, 1958, and denied July 23, 1958. The third petition was filed May 18, 1959, and denied June 12, 1959. These latter two petitions were denied by Judge William Gf. Juergens. The fourth petition was filed March 3, 1960, and denied March 31, 1960, by Judge Casper Platt. Thereafter petitioner filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus on September 12, 1960, which was denied September 13, 1960. A sixth petition for relief was filed October 17, 1960, and was denied November 16, 1960. These final two petitions were denied by Judge Casper Platt.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
