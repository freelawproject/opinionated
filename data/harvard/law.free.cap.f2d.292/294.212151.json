In particular, its \u201cJAL-DOR\u201d mark, acquired by assignment from a so-called \u201crelated company,\u201d is applied to jalousie doors principally made of aluminum.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">In reference to applicant\u2019s goods, the record shows that its \u201cJAL-O-VENT\u201d mark is used on jalousie windows which generally consist of an extruded aluminum frame supporting glass louvers and a screen, the frame being designed to be received in, and form a permanent part of, a glass block wall.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">In dismissing the opposition the board stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-7\">\u201cIt might well be that opposer is known in the field of trade to which most of its products pertain as the owner of a \u2018family\u2019 of marks characterized by the prefix \u2018Jal\u2019. Apart, however, from the mark \u2018Jal-Dor\u2019, the members of said family are used in connection with products which are so distinctly different from that sold by applicant under the mark \u2018Jal-O-Vent\u2019 that purchasers of applicant\u2019s product would not be likely to assume merely because of the inclusion of \u2018Jal\u2019 in applicant\u2019s mark that such goods originated with op-poser.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-8\">\u201cWhile \u2018Jal-Dor\u2019 jalousie doors and \u2018Jal-O-Vent\u2019 jalousie ventilators are closely related products, there can be no doubt but that to purchasers of such goods, \u2018Jal\u2019 and \u2018Jal-O\u2019 would immediately suggest a jalousie product and not opposer. Considering therefore the highly suggestive nature of the common component of these marks, it is concluded that the differences in the marks are sufficient to obviate any likelihood of confusion, mistake or deception of purchasers.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b343-14\">In asking us to reverse the board\u2019s decision, opposer urges that it is the owner of a family of marks characterized by the prefix \u201cJAL,\u201d which was chosen to represent the initial letters of the words \u201cJones and Laughlin,\u201d and that anyone seeing \u201cJAL\u201d as part of a trademark would regard that mark as another member of the family. In support thereof, it cites the testimony of several witnesses in the construction industry familiar with Jones <em>&amp; </em>Laughlin products. They stated, in effect, that they would have assumed, when first encountering the mark \u201cJAL-O-VENT,\u201d that it denoted another product of that company. The witnesses did not cite any instances of actual confusion but merely expressed an opinion as to the origin of the goods. Such opinions are not controlling. Quaker Oats Co. v. St. Joe Processing Co., Inc., 232 F.2d 653, 43 CCPA 892, and cases cited therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-15\">Moreover, as between opposer\u2019s \u201cJAL-DOR\u201d mark for jalousie doors and applicant\u2019s \u201cJAL-O-VENT\u201d for ventilators it is obvious that their only common feature is the \u201cJAL\u201d prefix, which is clearly suggestive of the jalousies on which the marks are used, and has little if any trademark significance. As observed in Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel Corporation v. Winter Seal Corporation, 291 F.2d 945, 48 CCPA -, \u201c * * * when \u2018Jal\u2019 is coupled with \u2018Dor,\u2019 an obvious misspelling of \u2018door,\u2019 the suggestive nature of both words weakens their trademark strength.\u201d .</p>\n<p id=\"b344-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>In our opinion the obvious differences in the marks in their sound, spelling, pronunciation and meaning are such as to obviate any likelihood of confusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">The contention of opposer that a third party possesses rights in \u201cJAL-O-VENT\u201d which are superior to applicant\u2019s is not pertinent. We fail to see how the rights of a stranger to this proceeding has any bearing on the issue of likelihood of confusion. Moreover, opposer has no standing to assert damage to itself because of third party rights. See Pocahontas Operators Association v. Carter Coal Co., 160 F.2d 114, 34 CCPA 926, 927, and Revere Paint Co. v. 20th Century Chemical Co., 150 F.2d 135, 32 CCPA 1096. Insofar as opposer urges that applicant\u2019s mark is incapable of indicating origin because of a third party use, that contention is not supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">The decision is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b342-14\">.
