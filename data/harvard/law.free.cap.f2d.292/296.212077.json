Use of the mark by applicant since June 18, 1957, is alleged. The opposer-appellant is Home Decorators, Inc., owner of the registered marks, \u201cPRESTIGE\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and \u201cPRESTIGE****PLATE,\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> for silver plated flatware.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-8\">During the period February 4, 1944, to September 24, 1954, opposer\u2019s silver plated flatware bore the mark \u201cPRESTIGE****PLATE.\u201d After the latter date, opposer started to use and still uses \u201cPRESTIGE\u201d as a trademark on silver plated flatware and carving sets.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-9\">Opposer sells its silver plated flatware directly to the ultimate consumer. A sales representative goes to the home of a prospective purchaser. Orders obtained thereby are submitted to opposer\u2019s home office for acceptance and the goods are shipped by opposer directly to the customer\u2019s home. Opposer\u2019s flatware has not been sold through any other channels of trade and has been widely advertised on television and in nationally distributed consumer magazines.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-15\">It is stipulated that applicant\u2019s bathroom, kitchen, and closet accessories are distributed through wholesale, retail, and jobber outlets.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-16\">Finding that the only issue was whether applicant\u2019s use of \u201cPRESTIGE\u201d for kitchen, closet, or toilet accessories is likely to cause confusion, mistake or deception of purchasers, the board dismissed the opposition, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-17\">\u201cThe word \u2018PRESTIGE\u2019 possesses an inherent connotation of quality, and, as shown by the record, it has been registered many times for many different kinds of merchandise.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-18\">\u201cWhile the products of both parties may be found in certain kinds of retail stores, they are not likely to be displayed or sold together there- \u2022 in, and they are not of a character which purchasers would be likely to attribute a common origin.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-19\">\u201cConsidering the nature of the mark \u2018PRESTIGE\u2019, and the differences between the goods, it is concluded that confusion or mistake or deception of purchasers is not likely to occur.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b345-20\">Opposer now maintains that it should have prevailed on either one or both of two grounds, viz., it will be damaged by the use by applicant of the mark on its goods because such use is likely to cause confusion or mistake or to deceive purchasers; the use of the mark by applicant on its goods \u201cwould clearly cause great damage to the image which Op-poser has carefully built up with regard to his [sic] mark \u2018PRESTIGE\u2019.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b345-21\"> Since the marks are the same, we must turn to the nature of the mark, the goods, and the channels of trade in considering the first contention. \u201cPres<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>tige\u201d is a common English word suggesting that the goods to which it is applied have attained a commanding position or are highly regarded. When one selects such a word for a trademark, he must realize that the scope of protection will be more limited than if he had chosen an arbitrary or fanciful word. In fairness to all others who desire to use the same word in a suggestive manner as a trademark, the protection to each user will usually be carefully confined to the particular goods or those closely related since its source-identifying qualities are equally limited.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">We are of the opinion in this instance that the goods of the respective parties are not so related that the use of \u201cPRESTIGE\u201d by the applicant on its goods is likely to cause confusion among purchasers.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">As for the channels of trade, according to the record, they are now definitely different, but even if the goods of both were sold in the same store, we think it is unlikely that confusion would result.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">Coming now to the question of op-poser\u2019s contention that it should prevail regardless of purchaser confusion because of the alleged dilution of opposer\u2019s mark by applicant, we do not agree with opposer\u2019s position in this matter either.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">Without passing on this question, this is not a case which would be controlled by this principle in any event. Since \u201cPrestige\u201d is a common English word which has been registered in one form or another as a trademark some 28 times, according to the record, for a variety of goods such as glass tumblers, onion-skin paper, grease, and sausage and meat loaf binder, we doubt that the registration of this word for bathroom, kitchen and closet accessories will dilute the word for trademark purposes or \u201ccause great damage to the image\u201d to any appreciable degree greater than has already been done by these other registrations. We affirm the decision of the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b345-11\">. Reg.
