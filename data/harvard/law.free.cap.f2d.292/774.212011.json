Defendant-appellee is a foreign corporation engaged in the manufacture and sale of furniture, with headquarters in North Carolina. Plaintiff-appellant attempted to effect service under the provisions of D.C.Code \u00a7 29-933i (Supp. VIII, 1960). The District Court granted motions by appellee to quash service and to dismiss the complaint. We affirm, on the sole ground that plaintiff-appellant failed to establish that it had complied with the statutory requirement of \u201cdelivering to and leaving with the Commissioners, or with any clerk having charge of their office * * \u201d copies of process.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b822-27\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b822-16\">. As amended in 1959, 73 Stat. 242, Section 29-933i reads in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ANU\">\u201cService shall be made by delivering to and leaving with the Commissioners, or with any clerk having charge of their office, duplicate copies of such process, notice, or demand, together with an affidavit giving the latest known post office address of such corporation * * Some three months after the attempted service bere, by order effective February 23, 1960, the Commissioners delegated their functions under the provision just quoted. They then named the Superintendent of Corporations as agent for the service of process with respect to a \u201cforeign corporation which shall transact business in the District of Columbia without a certificate of authority.\u201d VI D.C.Register 248 (1960).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
