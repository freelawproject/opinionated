It is contemplated that the method and apparatus would be used by dry cleaning establishments to protect freshly cleaned garments before and after they have been delivered to the customer.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-20\">Appellant\u2019s method involves two groups of steps. Steps [1], [2] and [3] of claim 12 are to be carried out at some central factory, while steps [4] through [7] are to be performed at the point of ultimate use in a dry cleaning establishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-17\">Appellant starts with a continuous flat tube of a thin flexibe heat-sealable plastic film such as polyethylene, and in step [1], the layers of film are heat-sealed together at regular intervals along pairs of strips, each strip extending upward and inward from a tube edge toward but not meeting another strip extending in like maimer from the opposite edge. Each pair of sealed strips will eventually become the shoulder end of a garment bag and the hook of a garment hanger will be passed through the unsealed space between the inner strip ends. In step [2], the tube is perforated directly above and along each pair of shoulder strips,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and in step [3], the heat-sealed perforated tube is wound into a roll which is sent to the dry cleaner.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-18\">In steps [4] to [7], the roll is mounted so that the flat tube can be unwound and its open leading edge pulled down over a garment on a hanger dependent from an upright support until the hanger hook passes through the neck opening between the inner ends of the first pair of shoulder strips. Thereupon, the end bag is torn at the perforation lines from the remainder of the roll.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-22\">Apparatus claim 13 recites the combination of [8], an upright support from which the garment depends on its hanger, [9] a roll of interconnected flat plastic garment bags, formed as discussed supra in steps [1] to [3] of claim 12, and [10], means for mounting the roll above the support so that the open leading end of the tube can be unwound and pulled down over the garment on its hanger, and the end bag separated at the perforation lines from the remainder of the roll.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-23\">La Bombard et al. disclose a method of making paper garment bags by gluing together two continuous flat strips of paper along both edges and along pairs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>of slanted shoulder lines spaced at regular intervals. Thereafter, individual bags are severed from the glued flat tube by cutting above and along each glued shoulder line as well as straight across at the neck line. A neck opening between the inner ends of the glued shoulder lines accommodates the hanger hook. In use, a dry cleaner is expected to take a single complete bag from the stack thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">The Blessing patents both disclose a machine to be used in a dry cleaning establishment. A garment on a hanger is positioned on a slanted plate with the hanger at the top, and a flat paper tube long enough to cover the garment is drawn down from a roll so that the tube partially envelops the garment. The tube is severed from the roll by cutting, the upper tube corners are folded and stapled or taped to conform to the shoulders and neck line of the garment, and the completed bag is drawn further over the garment and hanger until the hanger hook protrudes from the top of the bag.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">Denton discloses a machine similar to the Blessing machine and designed for use by a dry cleaner. A flat paper tube is pulled down from a roll partially over a garment on a hanger suspended from the top of a vertical support rod. As in Blessing, the tube is severed from the roll by cutting, the top corners are folded and stapled, and the completed bag is drawn further down into place over the garment hanger.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">It is noted that both Blessing and Denton contemplate producing garment bags of varying lengths to fit different types of garments.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">Piazze discloses a method of dispensing and using bags made of a thin flexible plastic film such as polyethylene, the material suggested by appellant in his method and apparatus. Piazze starts with a flat plastic tube with \u201cinfolded sides\u201d or \u201cbellows fold formations.\u201d The tube is sealed together along spaced transverse strips and provided with a perforated transverse tearing line adjacent and behind each strip seal. A center slit of substantial width is provided in each tearing line. The tube is then wound into a supply roll and delivered to the point of ultimate use where it is mounted in a dispensing cabinet so that the open leading end of the tube can be drawn up toward a filling spout until a hook catches the center slit of the tearing line which is below the strip seal. Further upward pull of the tube results in tearing off the end bag, leaving it in final condition for filling at the spout. The nature of the merchandise to be placed in the bags is not specified by Piazze.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-9\">The examiner rejected the claims \u201cas unpatentable over the combination of patents to La Bombard, Blessing and Piazze.\u201d The Denton patent was considered as cumulative to Blessing. It appears that the examiner considered La Bombard as a basic reference disclosing garment bag manufacture, and cited Blessing and Denton \u201conly to illustrate that it is conventional to provide garment bag material in strip form as a convenience in the supply of bag material for application to a garment * * *.\u201d The examiner appears to have considered it obvious to supply <em>shaved </em>bag units, as shown by La Bombard, in connected strip form, in view of the Piazze disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-10\">The board affirmed the examiner generally, stating in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-11\">\u201cThus, the question before us is whether, in view of the Piazze concept, it would be obvious (due to the reference disclosure) to one of ordinary skill in the art to supply rolls of preformed garment bags, so that the leading end could be fitted over the usual standard garment hanger and garment held thereon, with tearing of one bag from the other due to appropriately formed perforations, <em>instead of </em>providing for completing manufacturing of the roll as in Denton and each Blessing patent, * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-12\">\u201cWe agree with the examiner that the art makes obvious both this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>practice and the advantages thereof * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">The board appears to have considered \u201cthe Piazze concept\u201d to be manufacture of a roll of interconnected containers in a central factory and shipment of the roll to the user, thus \u201celiminating the necessity of individual small, inefficient manufacturing machines for each user, as in Denton and Blessing.\u201d The board pointed out that both the Piazze patent and appellant\u2019s disclosure pertain to the same subject, packaging of merchandise, even though the particular article packaged is different.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">The examiner considered certain affidavits presented by appellant and purporting to establish substantial commercial success of the claimed method and copying thereof by competitors, but stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-7\">\u201cSince the references are considered to plainly show lack of invention in the claims the affidavits are considered to be insufficient to establish the patentability of these claims.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b589-8\">Although the board did not discuss this point, it is well established that evidence of commercial success is to be considered only when the question of patentability is in doubt. In re Jaeger et al., 241 F.2d 723, 726, 44 CCPA 767, 771; In re Busch, 251 F.2d 617, 618, 45 CCPA 766, 769; In re Venner et al., 262 F.2d 91, 96, 46 CCPA 754, 760. Our view of the matter leaves no doubt. We are of the opinion that the appealed claims are not patentably distinguishable over the references. It appears to us that with the teachings* of La Bombard et al., Blessing, and Den-ton before him, it would be obvious to one of ordinary skill in this art to so modify Piazze as to produce the method and apparatus claimed by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-9\">The concept of using a continuous roll of packaging material in tubular form for hangered garment bags is taught by Blessing and Denton, and that of using a continuous roll of tubular polyethylene for packaging purposes generally is disclosed by Piazze. We see nothing of patentable significance in combining these two teachings to produce a continuous roll of tubular polyethylene for bagging hangered garments in a dry cleaning establishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-11\">As to the specific features of claim 12, appellant and Piazze begin with a continuous flat tube of material such as polyethylene, and in both situations the layers are heat-sealed at specified intervals. Also in both cases, the tubes are perforated immediately behind the heat-sealed strips as they appear on the rolls into which they are both formed after the aforesaid processing has been completed. In each case the rolls of polyethylene tubes are sent to their respective users, appellant\u2019s to a dry cleaner and Piazze\u2019s to a concern which fills the bag with some merchandise.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-12\">Thus far we find no significant difference. To be sure, the heat-sealed strips of Piazze art transverse while those of appellant are diagonal in order to conform to the configuration of shoulders of garments. However, to one skilled in the garment bag art, such a divergence would be obvious even if La Bombard et al., Blessing, and Den-ton were not in evidence as teachings of this feature. The difference in the location of the slits we do not think significant. In Piazze, the slit is part of the tearing process; in appellant\u2019s process, it is present to accommodate the protrusion of the hook of the garment hanger and is taught by La Bombard et al.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-13\">Coming now to appellant\u2019s method of applying polyethylene bags to the hangered garments, without discussing each feature, we find nothing which is patentably distinguishable from the methods taught by Blessing and Denton.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-14\">The combination of appellant\u2019s apparatus, as recited in claim 13, which includes the upright support, the roll of garment bagging material, and the device for mounting the roll so that the open end of the tubular material can be pulled down over the hangered garment, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>is all taught by either or both Denton and Blessing. The only difference between appellant\u2019s recitation in this claim and those of these references has to do with the severing process. Appellant accomplishes this result by tearing along a perforated line which procedure we find in Piazze; the references accomplish it by cutting the bagging material. The recitation of the features of the processed garment bag material in roll form in this claim is approximately a repetition of the recitation in claim 12 and need not be considered again.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">Some point is made by appellant of the fact that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-5\">\u201c * * * The complete concept of the invention encompasses the operations starting at the plant, where the tube is heat-sealed, perforated and wound into a roll, and ending with the completion of the individual garment bags after installation upon the garments.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">We agree with the board\u2019s observation concerning this matter wherein it stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-8\">\u201cThus, as compared to the art above discussed, we are in agreement with appellants\u2019 allegation contained on page 4 of the brief:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-9\">\u201c \u2018The important concept of the invention is to partially form a particular garment bag to produce the commercial product, i. e., the rolls which are delivered to the user. The garment bags are not completed until each is installed upon its garment.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b590-10\">The last sentence of this paragraph is, however, in our estimation, in error, namely:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-11\">\u201c \u2018This feature is new, and it proved to be the \u201clast step\u201d in solving an important problem.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-12\">\u201cIn our opinion, the remaining reference fully discloses the important concept as identified by appellants. Piazze discloses the concept of making bags out of sleeves of polyethylene which is the bag material utilized by appellants. These bags are for packaging merchandise other than clean garments carried by garment hangers. Piazze discloses the well-known fact that polyethylene is heat-sealable. He forms the bags in their individual form by heat-sealing and provides for separation of one bag from the other by a line of perforation. Thus, the important concept pointed out by appellants is present in Piazze although applied to a bag of specifically different form for packaging specifically different merchandise. Thus, appellants\u2019 \u2018last step\u2019 has been used prior to appellants in packaging other and different forms of merchandise.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b590-14\">For the foregoing reasons, we are of the opinion that claims 12 and 13 should not be allowed and therefore the decision of the board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"A1Q\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b587-24\">. The numbers do no appear in the claims but have been inserted to aid in the discussion which follows.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b587-26\">. The specification recites connection of inner ends of the perforation lines by a slit in each film layer. This is not a claim limitation.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
