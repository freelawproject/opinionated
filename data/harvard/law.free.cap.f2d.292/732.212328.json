The facts may be stated briefly as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b781-12\">On July 27, 1955, appellant was committed to St. Elizabeths Hospital after a jury had found him not guilty by reason of insanity. The charge was assault with a dangerous weapon and assault with intent to kill [his sleeping father] <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On November 21, 1958, the Superintendent of the hospital, Dr. Winfred Overholser, appellee here, certified under oath to the District Court that appellant had recovered and \u201cis now of sound mind and has been discharged from treatment in said hospital November 7, 1958.\u201d Appellant was thereupon released.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-13\">On September 20, 1959, appellant was indicted<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> for (1) bank robbery [18 U. S.C. \u00a7 2113(a)] and (2) being an accessory after the fact [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3] of the bank robbery. On June 29, 1960, he was tried in the District Court. He was found not guilty of the charge of bank robbery, and not guilty by reason of insanity of the offense of being an accessory after the fact. Pursuant to \u00a7 24-301(d) D.C.Code (1951), appellant was again committed to St. Elizabeths Hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-17\">Thereafter, appellant filed his petition for writ of habeas corpus, claiming to be of sound mind and eligible for release. A rule to show cause was issued and a return and answer to the petition was filed, the Superintendent of the hospital stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b781-18\">\u201cDuring this petitioner\u2019s period of confinement in Saint Elizabeths Hospital, he has been under the care and observation of the respondent, as well as other members of the medical staff of Saint Elizabeths Hospital, skilled in the care, diagnosis, and treatment of nervous and mental disorders, who are of the opinion that he has not recovered from his abnormal mental condition and requires further treatment before he can be certified as not dangerous to himself or others if released into the community.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b781-19\">A hearing was had before Judge Hart and, after the taking of testimony and argument of counsel, the court made findings of fact and conclusions of law. The court found on satisfactory evidence, that appellant \u201cis presently suffering from an abnormal mental condition, namely, schizophrenic reaction, chronic undifferentiated type, for which he is receiving treatment at the hospital,\u201d and further found that the Superintendent\u2019s failure to certify appellant as eligible for release was not arbitrary or capricious, and that appellant\u2019s detention was lawful. The court thereupon dismissed the petition for writ of habeas corpus, dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>charged the writ, and remanded appellant to the custody of appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\">On this appeal, court-appointed counsel argues that the mandatory confinement statute [\u00a7 24-301 (d) D.C.Code] is unconstitutional because it provides for mandatory commitment after a person is found not guilty by reason of insanity. This question is settled in this jurisdiction by our decisions in Ragsdale v. Overholser, 1960, 108 U.S.App.D.C. 308, 281 F.2d 943; O\u2019Beirne v. Overholser, 1960, 109 U.S.App.D.C. 279, 287 F.2d 133; and Curry v. Overholser, 1960, 109 U.S.App.D.C. 283, 287 F.2d 137. And see Orencia v. Overholser, 1947, 82 U.S.App.D.C. 285, 163 F.2d 763, which preceded the statutory amendment attacked by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">Counsel secondly contends that .appellant\u2019s present confinement is unjustified by virtue of the fact that he is not receiving the psychiatric treatment which is supposed to justify \u201cthe confinement of persons in insane asylums who have never been found insane.\u201d We believe the evidence sufficiently demonstrates that appellant is receiving treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">It is further contended that the .action of appellee in failing to certify that appellant is eligible for release from the hospital is arbitrary and capricious. Dr. Overholser did not testify at the hearing but Dr. Owens, a member of the staff who had appellant under charge, did testify as to appellant\u2019s abnormal mental condition and as to his treatment. As a matter of fact, Dr. Owens was called by appellant and appellee was content to rest his case on appellant\u2019s presentation. We know no reason why Dr. Overholser should be compelled to testify, although he was available for calling, had appellant desired to summon him as a witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-7\">We find nothing in the record to substantiate the allegation that appellee\u2019s refusal to grant the requested certification was arbitrary or capricious. The action of the District Court, in holding appellant\u2019s present detention to be lawful and directing that the petition be dismissed and the writ discharged, should be and is</p>\n<p id=\"Aq_\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b781-14\">.
