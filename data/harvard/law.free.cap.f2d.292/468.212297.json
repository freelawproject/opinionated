And secondly, that the detainer operates to unlawfully and prejudicially deprive him of certain rehabilitative privileges, such as parole, accorded by federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-25\"> A prisoner may not, however, complain of the filing of a state detainer as a usurpation of federal jurisdiction over him, for \u201ceither the federal or a state government may voluntarily surrender its prisoner to the other without the consent of the prisoner, and * * the question of jurisdiction and custody is purely one of comity between the two sovereigns, not a personal right of the prisoner * * Wall v. Hudspeth, 10 Cir., 108 F.2d 865, 866. See also Rosenthal v. Hunter, 10 Cir., 164 F.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>949; Ramsey v. United States, 9 Cir., 248 F.2d 532. And this is so even though the detainer results in his ineligibility for parole, for parole is a privilege, the lawful deprivation of which does not impinge upon any constitutional right. Singleton v. Looney, 10 Cir., 218 F.2d 526. See also Latham v. United States, <em>5 </em>Cir., 259 F.2d 393.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\">The judgment of the trial court is therefore affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
