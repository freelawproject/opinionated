J.</author>\n<p id=\"AqGs\">A similar motion was made in <em>Le Conte </em>v. <em>Pendleton, 1 Johns. C. </em>104, which was granted, and <em>that </em>the defendant elect, in four days, which of the pleas he would abide by, <em>or, </em>in default, that the plaintiff elect. In <em>Carnes </em>v. <em>Duncan, Cole. C. </em>35, the defendant pleaded <em>payment </em>and <em>nul tiel record. </em>The court ordered the defendant to elect, on the ground that <em>ml tiel record </em>was not within the reason of the statute for double pleading, because the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>fendant might know, with absolute certainty, whether there was such a record or not. <em>Dunlap </em>says: \u201c The defendant will not be allowed to plead matters which require different trials, as <em>ml liel record </em>and <em>payment; </em>one of which must be tried by the record, and the other by the country.\u201d In <em>Weatherwax </em>v. <em>Averill, </em>6 <em>Cowen, </em>589, to a declaration on a justice\u2019s judgment, the defendant pleaded <em>payment </em>and <em>nul tiel </em>record; and the court refused to compel the defendant to elect, because in that case both must be tried by a jury, a justice\u2019s judgment not being a record, but a specialty, 16 <em>Johns. R. 233</em>; but recognizing the practice in a proper case.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-4\">It was suggested in argument, that the discharge could not be attacked, unless the defendant was convicted of perjury, and <em>Cable </em>v. <em>Cooper, </em>15 Johns. <em>R. </em>152, was referred to. Van Ness, justice, there says, that if the defendant had been convicted of perjury in.obtaining his discharge, he might be .again imprisoned. He was speaking of a*discharge, where the party had once been actually imprisoned, which is not now necessary to obtain a discharge under the act of 1819, which retains the same provision as that under which that decision was made; but it also adopts certain sections of the act for giving relief in cases of insolvency, the 29th section of which permits a plaintiff to reply fraud to such a plea, and to specify the acts of fraud in a notice. 1 <em>R. L. </em>471. But I am inclined to think that the <em>Revised Statutes, vol. </em>2, <em>p. </em>409, \u00a7 4, have abolished all distinctions as to the trial of facts; all <em>issues of fact </em>are to be tried by a jury, except where a reference is ordered. By the <em>Revised Laws, vol. </em>1, <em>p. </em>325, all issues <em>triable by a jury </em>were to be tried at a circuit or sittings, or at bar. I am inclined to think, therefore, the motion must be denied, but without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
