The action was <em>covenant, </em>on a lease by a landlord against his tenant- The tenant had covenanted not to cut green or growing timber on the demised premises during the term ; to make all necessary repairs, during the term, at his own expense ; to keep the premises in tenantable repair, and at the expiration of the term, deliver them up in such repair. The plaintiff assigned breaches of each of those covenants. The defendant pleaded <em>non est jactum, </em>general performance, special performance, denial, and licence to cut timber. The cause came on to trial at the circuit, and after <em>ten </em>hours spent in examining witnesses on the part of the plaintiff, and he resting, the defendant's counsel opened the defence. Whereupon the circuit judge, without the motion of the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>fendant\u2019s counsel, and in opposition to the wishes of the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, ordered a rule to be entered, <em>referring </em>the cause to three referees, and discharged the jury. A motion was now made to vacate the rule of reference. In opposition to the motion, it was shewn that the claim of the plaintiff consisted of a great number of <em>items, </em>and that the time spent on the trial was occupied in proof of such items.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b500-3\"><em>J.

It is only where the trial will require the examination of a long <em>account, </em>that an order can be made for the reference of a cause. <em>2 R. S. </em>384, \u00a7 39, 41. Had the reference proceeded, and had the plaintiff obtained a report in his favor, a judgment on such report would have been erroneous.

Edwards, </em>for defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AcC\">Whenever the trial of a cause requires an examination of a variety of items, it is a proper case for reference.

There is nothing of the nature of an account in it, although there may be sundry items of damage. The statute authorizes a reference only where the matter in controversy arises upon an <em>account </em>existing between the parties. The cause is not referable, and the order for reference must be vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">Motion granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
