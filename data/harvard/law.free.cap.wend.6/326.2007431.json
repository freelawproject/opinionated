This was an action of covenant by the executors of a <em>tenant </em>to recover of a <em>landlord </em>for improvements made on the demised premises, during the continuance of the term, under a covenant contained in the lease, whereby the landlord had bound himself to pay whatever the improvements should be appraised at, not exceeding a certain sum. A recovery was had against the landlord, and he applied for a new trial which was granted, as will be seen by reference to 6 <em>Cowen, </em>302, because in estimating the amount, <em>ordinary repairs </em>were included in the appraisement. In the second trial those repairs were omitted, and the landlord again applied for a new trial, contending that by the terms of the covenant he was not liable, except for the value of <em>new buildings, </em>if any, erected by the ten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>ant. In the case in 6 Cowen, the court decided this question against the landlord, and on the second application for a new trial confirmed their former decision, and gave judgment against the landlord, who sued out his writ of error to this court. The covenant is <em>vaguely </em>worded, and as it is supposed the decision in this case will rarely,\" if ever, serve as a precedent, it is deemed unnecessary to state the case more fully. The <em>chancellor </em>delivered an opinion in favor of the affirmance of the supreme court, and the court being unanimously of opinion that the judgment ought to be affirmed, it was <em>affirmed </em>accordingly.</summary>\n<opinion>[NO OPINION]</opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"}}
