In upholding the trial court\u2019s judgment, the Appellate Court held that under the facts of the case, the defendant had not been deprived of his rights to due process of law as provided by the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution and article first, \u00a7\u00a7 8 and 20, of the Connecticut constitution. <em>State </em>v. <em>Gilbert, </em>30 Conn. App. 428, 436, 620 A.2d 822 (1993).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">The pertinent undisputed facts as set forth in the Appellate Court opinion are as follows. \u201cOn August 3, 1990, at approximately 8:30 p.m., the defendant, Michael J. Gilbert, left Hank\u2019s Restaurant on Route 6 in Brooklyn, Connecticut. He had been there for a few hours and had consumed some alcoholic drinks and pizza. Outside the restaurant, he smelled of alcohol, his speech was slurred and his balance was unsteady. He shuffled when walking and faltered getting into his vehicle, a 1981 Ford Escort. He slumped out of the driver\u2019s window and dropped his keys. His eyes were bloodshot and watery. He was upset and planned to drive to another bar located in another town.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">\u201cSome time before 9 p.m., the defendant, driving in the westbound lane on Route 6 with his headlights off, collided with a vehicle being operated in the eastbound lane. Route 6 is a two lane road, with one lane in each direction; the posted speed limit is forty-five miles per hour. The weather at the time was clear, and the road <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>conditions were dry. The driver of the other vehicle, a 1980 Toyota Corolla, died as a result of injuries she received in the accident. The defendant was found unconscious in the driver\u2019s seat of his car. He smelled of alcohol, and there were several open and empty beer cans in the vehicle, as well as a number of unopened cans of beer. The point of impact appeared to be in the eastbound lane, in which the victim was driving.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">\u201cThe defendant was taken to Day Kimball Hospital in Putnam, where, as part of the hospital\u2019s regular course of diagnosis and treatment of trauma patients, a blood sample was taken. The test revealed that the defendant\u2019s blood alcohol level per deciliter was 0.226, which translates to a 0.194 percent alcohol ratio. As a result of the accident, the defendant suffered a traumatic brain injury which resulted in temporary paralysis and coma. In addition, the defendant suffered some loss of memory.\u201d Id., 429-30.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">Following a competency hearing held pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-56d,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> at which the court, <em>Sfer</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number><em>razza, J., </em>found the defendant competent to stand trial, the trial court considered the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss in which he raised the claim that he could not receive a fair trial because of his amnesia. At the hearing on the motion to dismiss, the defendant argued, pursuant to <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>391 F.2d 460, 463-64 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>(D.C. Cir. 1968), for the application of a multifactor approach to the question of whether a defendant\u2019s loss of memory precludes his prosecution. Under <em>Wilson, </em>in determining the effect of amnesia on the trial\u2019s fairness the trial court should consider six factors: (1) the extent to which the amnesia affected the defendant\u2019s ability to consult with and assist his lawyer; (2) the extent to which the amnesia affected the defendant\u2019s ability to testify on his own behalf; (3) the extent to which the evidence in the suit could be extrinsically reconstructed in view of the defendant\u2019s amnesia, including evidence relating to the crime itself as well as any reasonably possible alibi; (4) the extent to which the government assisted the defendant and his counsel in that reconstruction; (5) the strength of the prosecution\u2019s case, with the most important consideration pertaining to whether the government\u2019s case is such as to negate all reasonable hypotheses of innocence; and (6) any other facts and circumstances that would indicate whether or not the defendant had a fair trial. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">The trial court considered the specific findings required by <em>Wilson </em>to be \u201cimpractical and unnecessary to a determination of whether a defendant would be denied due process of law if forced to stand trial.\u201d The court instead adopted the approach employed by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>406 F.2d 180, 186 (2d Cir. 1969). Unlike the <em>Wilson </em>test that requires a trial court both to conduct a pretrial competency hearing and make a posttrial determination as to whether the defendant had been able to perform \u201c \u2018the functions essential to the fairness and accuracy of the particular proceedings in which he [was] presently involved\u2019 \u201d as measured by six factors; <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 391 F.2d 463; the <em>Sullivan </em>test requires a more limited inquiry. The <em>Sullivan </em>test focuses on whether amnesia <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>prevented the defendant from forming the requisite intent for the offenses charged and on whether the defendant was competent at the time of trial to consult rationally with counsel and to understand the nature of the proceedings against him. <em>United, States </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>supra, 186.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">Although, in deciding the motion to dismiss, the trial court expressed its preference for the <em>Sullivan </em>test, it nevertheless performed a case-by-case analysis and concluded that the defendant\u2019s amnesia did not severely undermine his present ability to consult rationally with his attorney or strip him of the opportunity to reconstruct events independent of his recollections. As part of its evaluation, the court reviewed both reports that had been prepared pursuant to \u00a7 54-56d for assessment of the defendant\u2019s competency to stand trial. Each report concluded that the defendant could communicate and consult rationally with his attorney and could provide information regarding some of the related charges, including the lapse of insurance on his vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">The trial court found that the only significant consequence of the accident had been the defendant\u2019s loss of memory. The court noted that the charges did not require specific intent or guilty knowledge. It further remarked that there was an open file policy with regard to discovery, so that the defendant had access to: the state\u2019s accident reconstruction report; names, addresses and statements of witnesses; photographs and information as to the physical evidence found at the scene; and medical information, including blood alcohol levels, on both the victim and the defendant. The court observed that the defendant could not claim alibi or mistaken identification in light of the evidence that he had been found alone in his car immediately after the accident. The court determined, therefore, that the significant issues were intoxication and causation, matters usually proven by physical evidence and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>independent witnesses. In denying the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss, the trial court concluded that the defendant had access to all of the available information necessary to reconstruct the accident, and that his amnesia did not interfere with his ability to have a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">During the trial before Judge Dunn, the defendant made a motion in limine to prevent the introduction of \u201ctestimony concerning phis] conversations . . . during the period immediately preceding the accident,\u201d claiming that he could not confront such witnesses due to his amnesia. Specifically, the defendant argued that his amnesia prevented him from \u201cconfronting\u201d two witnesses, Delana O\u2019Neill and Henry Hewig, with whom he allegedly had conversed outside of Hank\u2019s Restaurant before the accident.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After the trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion in limine, O\u2019Neill and Hewig testified for the state. The defendant cross-examined the latter regarding the direction Hewig saw him take outside the restaurant, the appearance of the defendant\u2019s eyes, and certain purported inconsistencies between Hewig\u2019s testimony and the statement that Hewig had given to the state police two days after the accident.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The defendant did not cross examine O\u2019Neill, and did not present any independent evidence regarding his encounter with those two men.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">Following the jury\u2019s verdict of guilty of all the crimes charged, the defendant moved for a judgment of aequit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>tal, relying on the <em>Wilson </em>factors. The trial court denied the motion, and rendered a judgment of conviction. The defendant appealed from the judgment of conviction to the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">Without specifically endorsing the <em>Wilson </em>or the <em>Sullivan </em>approach, the Appellate Court concluded from its review of the record that \u201cthe trial court reasonably could have concluded that the defendant possessed a \u2018sufficient present ability to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational understanding\u2014 and ... a rational as well as factual understanding of the proceedings against him\u2019 . . . and that the defense had an ample opportunity to reconstruct the events of the evening in question and to cross-examine witnesses, even without the defendant\u2019s specific recollection of events.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Gilbert, </em>supra, 30 Conn. App. 436. Accordingly, the Appellate Court affirmed the judgment of conviction. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">The defendant asks this court to adopt the analysis set forth in <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 391 F.2d 462, in considering his claim that his memory loss should have precluded his prosecution. In <em>Wilson, </em>the court of appeals rejected the argument that amnesia should result in an absolute bar to prosecution when the defendant is fully competent to stand trial. See <em>Leach </em>v. <em>Kolb, </em>911 F.2d 1249, 1260-61 (7th Cir.), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Leach </em>v. <em>McCaughtry, </em>498 U.S. 972, 111 S. Ct. 441, 112 L. Ed. 2d 424 (1990) (amnesia is not a per se bar to prosecution of an otherwise competent defendant); accord <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Wyrick, </em>766 F.2d 1197, 1202 (8th Cir. 1985), cert. denied, 475 U.S. 1020, 106 S. Ct. 1209, 89 L. Ed. 2d 322 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>McClendon, </em>103 Ariz. 105, 107, 437 P.2d 421 (1968); <em>Reagon v. State, </em>253 Ind. 143, 153-54, 251 N.E.2d 829 (1969); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lombardi, </em>378 Mass. 612, 615, 393 N.E.2d 346 (1979); see also annot., Amnesia <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>As Affecting Capacity to Commit Crime or Stand Trial, 46 A.L.R.3d 544 (1972 &amp; Sup. 1993). Notwithstanding that position, the <em>Wilson </em>court also rejected the government\u2019s contention that amnesia, without an accompanying disease or defect, can <em>never </em>render an accused incompetent to stand trial. <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 463; see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Rinchack, </em>820 F.2d 1557, 1564 (11th Cir. 1987). Rather, the court held that due process requires a pretrial hearing, and in the event that a trial is held, a posttrial hearing to evaluate, on a case-by-case basis, the effect of amnesia both on the defendant\u2019s competency to stand trial and on the fairness of the trial. <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 463.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">This accords with the principle articulated by this court that \u201cin all cases involving what is or is not due process ... no hard and fast rule can be laid down. The pattern of due process is picked out in the facts and circumstances of each case.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State v. Lovelace, </em>191 Conn. 545, 552, 469 A.2d 391 (1983), cert. denied, 465 U.S. 1107, 104 S. Ct. 1613, 80 L. Ed. 2d 142 (1984); see <em>Tedesco </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>222 Conn. 233, 244, 610 A.2d 574 (1992). We continue to adhere to that position and agree with the many jurisdictions that have either followed the <em>Wilson </em>approach strictly or have engaged in a factual analysis of the effect of amnesia on the fairness of the trial. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Villegas, </em>899 F.2d 1324, 1341 (2d Cir. 1990); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Rinchack, </em>supra, 820 F.2d 1569; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mota, </em>598 F.2d 995, 998 (5th Cir. 1979), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Flores </em>v. <em>United States, </em>444 U.S. 1084, 100 S.

State, </em>247 Ga. 142, 146, 274 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>S.E.2d 525 (1981); <em>State </em>v. <em>Owens, </em>248 Kan. 273, 280, 807 P.2d 101 (1991); <em>State </em>v. <em>Gilder, </em>223 Kan. 220, 224, 574 P.2d 196 (1977); <em>State </em>v. <em>Blake, </em>209 Kan. 196, 200-201, 495 P.2d 905 (1972); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lombardi, </em>supra, 378 Mass. 615-16; <em>People </em>v. <em>Francabandera, </em>33 N.Y.2d 429, 436-38, 310 N.E.2d 292, 354 N.Y.S.2d 609 (1974); <em>State </em>v. <em>Vassar, </em>279 N.W.2d 678, 682-83 (S.D. 1979); <em>State </em>v. <em>McIntosh, </em>137 Wis. 2d 339, 347, 404 N.W.2d 557 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">In examining the factors set forth in <em>Wilson, </em>we particularly note that it is \u201cthe probability of prejudice, not [the] lack of memory per se, [that is] controlling.\u201d <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 391 F.2d 464 n.4. All that is required is that the defendant and counsel be able to \u201c \u2018perform the functions essential to the fairness and accuracy of the particular proceedings ....\u2019\u201d Id., 463. The <em>Wilson </em>court held that the standard of review is whether there exists a \u201creasonable basis for any contention that the outcome was significantly affected by [the] appellant\u2019s lack of memory.\u201d Id., 464 (Levanthal, J., concurring). Due to the plethora of evidence available to reconstruct events, independent of both the defendant and the victim, and the absence of a showing that the defendant was unable to present any potential defense, we conclude that the defendant\u2019s amnesia did not \u201csignificantly affect\u201d the outcome of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">Under <em>Wilson, </em>the first factor is the extent to which the defendant\u2019s amnesia has affected his ability to consult with and assist his attorney, separate and apart from his memory loss. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Rinchack, </em>supra, 820 F.2d 1569; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Swanson, </em>572 F.2d 523, 526 (5th Cir. 1978). The trial court found that the defendant had \u201cno difficulty\u201d understanding the nature of the proceedings or in \u201ccommunicating with others,\u201d and that he was competent to stand trial and therefore was able to assist his attorney in his defense. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>defendant does not challenge that finding on appeal. The trial court also found that the defendant did not appear to have difficulty consulting with his counsel as to potential defenses and witnesses. As the defendant states in his brief to this court, his defense was to contest \u201ctwo essential elements of the state\u2019s case, namely, that he was under the influence . . . [and] that . . . the accident took place in the other driver\u2019s lane.\u201d There was no paucity of witnesses or evidence on these elements from the five defense witnesses: the bartender and permittee of the restaurant; an expert in accident reconstruction; and two employees of the automobile repair shop where the defendant\u2019s car was taken. It was also reasonably possible for counsel to identify and question other potential witnesses, i.e., relatives and persons who worked with, lived near or otherwise had been associated with the defendant during that time period.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">Nonetheless, the defendant contends that his inability to remember events that had occurred prior to the accident left his counsel with \u201cno idea how to cross-examine\u201d the state\u2019s witnesses O\u2019Neill and Hewig, who testified as to his intoxicated condition at the restaurant. We cannot fathom, however, how the defendant\u2019s ability to recall these events would have served to alter or improve defense counsel\u2019s cross-examination. The defendant failed to suggest any scenarios upon which the trial court could have ruminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">The defendant also complains that he was \u201cstuck with any inculpatory answers\u201d as to his own statements given at the restaurant. The record belies this assertion. In fact, the defendant presented evidence to contradict the state\u2019s witnesses. Tracy Elliott, the bartender, and Roland LaCharite, the permittee of Hank\u2019s Restaurant, testified to the defendant\u2019s apparent sobriety during the same time frame. Elliott remembered that the defendant had eaten one half of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>a pizza and had used the telephone, and both she and LaCharite noted that the defendant had not staggered or swayed. Elliott also indicated that O\u2019Neill and Hewig had not been at the restaurant that night. In addition, the automobile repair shop personnel indicated that there had been leftover pizza in the defendant\u2019s car, which neither O\u2019Neill nor Hewig mentioned, and which might have indicated both that the defendant had been less affected by his alcohol consumption than the state\u2019s evidence suggested and that the state\u2019s witnesses\u2019 observation of him had been less than accurate.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">Moreover, the defendant overestimates the significance of the brief conversation O\u2019Neill and Hewig related having had with him. According to O\u2019Neill and Hewig, the defendant admitted that he had had a few drinks, that he was upset, that he was driving to another bar and that he did not want a taxi. The state did not, however, rely on that testimony as its primary evidence. On the contrary, the state\u2019s case largely depended upon later events, such as the reconstruction of the accident itself and the medical testimony regarding the effects of the defendant\u2019s blood alcohol level. Furthermore, the evidence of what had occurred prior to the accident consisted largely of behavioral and not testimonial evidence. The defendant\u2019s actions\u2014his shuffling, faltering, unbalanced walk, his slumping out his window, and his dropping of his keys\u2014together with his bloodshot and watery eyes, his slurred speech, and his odor of alcohol, were significantly more important to the state\u2019s case than his few words.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">The second factor under <em>Wilson, </em>whether amnesia affected the defendant\u2019s ability to testify on matters other than the event that gave rise to his amnesia; see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Rinchack, </em>supra, 820 F.2d 1569; also weighs against him. Because \u201cinebriation and causation\u201d were, as the trial court remarked, the only real issues in the case, in the absence of any claim that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>was otherwise unable to take the stand and testify, the defendant presumably could have provided, for example, the following pertinent exculpatory testimony: that he was not an alcoholic; that he did not drink and drive; that he knew the road and the accident site; that O\u2019Neill and Hewig were not truthful; and that he could not have been inebriated in light of the fact that he had eaten one half of a pizza.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">Other testimony that could have been exculpatory, but for the defendant\u2019s amnesia, was very limited. As the trial court found, this case did not involve a defense of alibi or mistaken identity: \u201c[T]he question of operation appears uncontrovertible given the evidence that the defendant was found alone in his own vehicle after the crash and witnesses observed him driving onto Route 6 just before the crash.\u201d Although the defendant was obviously unable to provide a specific self-serving denial of wrongdoing, he has not provided any explanation or offer of proof regarding the type of testimony that he could have offered, the reasons he did not take the stand, or why we should presume that, but for the amnesia, he could have established a defense. \u201cIt is always possible that a defendant could gain an acquittal by perjuring himself, or more conscionably by presenting such a sympathetic figure on the witness stand that the jury would have used the mercy-dispensing power that it has in fact, though not in law. But such possibilities of prejudice, however realistic, do not suffice to prohibit the entry of a judgment on a verdict of guilty.\u201d <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 391 F.2d 465 (Leventhal,- J., concurring). The present record fails to demonstrate that the defendant would not have made the same tactical decision not to testify even if amnesia had not been a factor. Furthermore, the record does not indicate that, aside from his amnesia, the defendant\u2019s ability to testify had otherwise been unfairly limited.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>The third inquiry under <em>Wilson </em>explores whether the facts were capable of being reconstructed independent of the defendant\u2019s own recollection. Here, there was an abundance of evidence as to what had occurred: four witnesses, two for the state and two for the defense, testified to events at the restaurant immediately preceding the accident; four accident reconstruction experts, three for the state and one for the defense, along with a large amount of physical evidence, served to reconstruct the accident itself; and medical evidence informed the jury about the defendant\u2019s blood alcohol level shortly after the accident, and offered \u201crelation back\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> testimony as to his alcohol level, and its effects on his ability to drive. Finally, as the trial court noted, because the offenses at issue do not require specific intent or knowledge, they were \u201cparticularly amenable to reconstruction, despite the defendant\u2019s memory loss, because the defendant\u2019s contemporaneous mental state is immaterial.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lombardi, </em>supra, 378 Mass. 616 (listing nature of crime as factor to examine).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">The fourth factor under <em>Wilson </em>is the extent to which the government assisted the defense in the reconstruction of the accident. The trial court found that the state had \u201cprovided the defense with open discovery,\u201d including a copy of a \u201ctwenty-two page accident investigation report . . . [that] provides the names and statements of the defendant\u2019s friends who talked with him and observed his physical condition as he exited the restaurant, entered his vehicle, and drove off onto <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>Route 6.\u201d The report also provided the names and statements of witnesses at the accident scene, and disclosed \u201ca wealth of physical evidence obtained at the scene and thereafter, including debris dispersal analysis, diagrams, measurements, an inventory of the contents of the vehicles, and other material pertinent to accident reconstruction. It comprises medical information regarding the cause of death of the victim and the medical condition of the defendant, including the blood alcohol ratio for both parties.\u201d The report also indicated that \u201cphotographs of the accident scene and the vehicles on the date of the accident and at later times\u201d had been taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">When the state called Trooper Robert Mantho of the Connecticut state police to the stand, the defendant noted that he had no information about him. The defendant now argues that because the state failed to disclose Mantho\u2019s \u201crole and conclusions prior to his testimony,\u201d the state failed adequately to assist him in the reconstruction of the accident. This argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">Mantho, the state\u2019s accident reconstruction expert in the present case, testified that his conclusions were \u201cdependent on the photograph evidence, primarily, and the documented measurements that were provided to me by the on-scene troopers.\u201d As the trial court indicated at the hearing on the motion to dismiss, the defendant had the twenty-two page accident report that disclosed all material pertinent to accident reconstruction. In addition, when the defendant complained that he did not know who Mantho was, other than that he was an expert witness, the court offered defense counsel additional time to prepare for cross-examination and to call a rebuttal expert, and allowed him to discuss Mantho\u2019s testimony with the defense expert despite the sequestration order. The defendant has not claimed a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>violation of any Practice Book provision,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and does not dispute that the state had an open file policy in this case. Nor does the defendant suggest that his own reconstruction expert had been hindered in any way. There <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>is little question that the defendant, therefore, received ample assistance by the state in reconstructing the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">The fifth factor under <em>Wilson </em>is the strength of the state\u2019s case.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The record reflects that three separate officers with experience in accident reconstruction opined, based upon an extensive evaluation of all pertinent evidence at the scene, that the defendant\u2019s car had crossed over into the victim\u2019s lane. Two lay witnesses, friends of the defendant with no apparent reason to accuse him falsely, testified that they had been concerned about his driving because his actions and speech had indicated that he was under the influence. An expert medical witness also testified that shortly after the accident the defendant had had a blood alcohol level of 0.226, far above the level required for conviction under General Statutes \u00a7 14-277a (a) or (b).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>defendant argues that there was conflicting testimony, both as to whether he had been under the influence and as to the lane in which the vehicles collided. The mere fact that there was conflicting evidence, however, does not necessarily make the state\u2019s case weak. In sum, the evidence, if credited, amply supported the jury\u2019s verdict.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">The last area of inquiry under <em>Wilson </em>allows the trial court to consider any other relevant criteria in assessing whether the defendant\u2019s amnesia should preclude his prosecution. For the first time in this case, the defendant claims that \u201che could not exercise his civil rights due to his mental disability,\u201d i.e., his amnesia, in violation of article first, \u00a7 20, of the Connecticut constitution.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We decline to consider this claim because, as the state correctly points out, the defendant did not raise it in his appeal to the Appellate Court or in the certified question to this court. On certification, our focus is on the judgment of the Appellate Court. <em>Cahn </em>v. <em>Cahn, </em>225 Conn. 666, 671, 626 A.2d 296 (1993); <em>Essex </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number><em>Leasing, Inc. </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>206 Conn. 595, 599, 539 A.2d 101 (1988). The defendant did not raise the state constitutional claim in the Appellate Court and it does not appear anywhere in the opinion of the Appellate Court. Unlike <em>State </em>v. <em>Joyce, </em>30 Conn. App. 164, 188-90, 619 A.2d 872 (1993) <em>(Heiman, J., </em>dissenting), rev\u2019d, 229 Conn. 10, 639 A.2d 1007 (1994), in which the Appellate Court dissent relied on the state constitution and we specifically certified the issue,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> neither situation is present here.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b252-8\"> We granted the defendant\u2019s petition for certification limited to the following issue: \u201cUnder the circumstances of this case, did the defendant\u2019s amnesia prevent him from receiving a fair trial?\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Gilbert, </em>225 Conn. 917, 623 A.2d 1025 (1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b253-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 54-56d provides in pertinent part: \u201c(Formerly See. 54-40). COMPETENCY TO STAND TRIAL, (a) COMPETENCY REQUIRED. DEFINITION. A defendant shall not be tried, convicted or sentenced while he is not competent. For the purposes of this section, a defendant is not competent if he is unable to understand the proceedings against him or to assist in his own defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-9\">\u201c(b) PRESUMPTION OF COMPETENCY. A defendant is presumed to be competent. The burden of proving that the defendant is not competent by clear and convincing evidence and the burden of going forward with the evidence are on the party raising the issue. The burden of going forward with the evidence shall be on the state if the court raises the issue. The court may call its own witnesses and conduct its own inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-10\">\u201c(c) REQUEST FOR EXAMINATION. If at any time during a criminal proceeding it appears that the defendant is not competent, counsel for the defendant or for the state, or the court, on its own motion, may request an examination to determine the defendant\u2019s competency.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-11\">\u201c(d) EXAMINATION OF DEFENDANT, report. If the court finds that the request for an examination is justified and that, in accordance with procedures established by the judges of the superior court, there is probable cause to believe that the defendant has committed the crime for which he is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>charged, the court shall order an examination of the defendant as to his competency. The court either may appoint one or more physicians specializing in psychiatry to examine the defendant or it may order the commissioner of mental health to conduct the examination either by a clinical team consisting of a physician specializing in psychiatry, a clinical psychologist and a psychiatric social worker, or by one or more physicians specializing in psychiatry. If the commissioner of mental health is ordered to conduct the examination, he shall select the members of the clinical team or the physician or physicians. If the examiners determine that the defendant is not competent, they shall then determine whether there is substantial probability that the defendant, if provided with a course of treatment, will regain competency within the maximum period of any placement order under this section. The court may authorize a physician specializing in psychiatry, a clinical psychologist or a psychiatric social worker selected by the defendant to observe the examination. Counsel for the defendant may observe the examination. The examination shall be completed within fifteen days from the date it was ordered. The examiner or examiners shall prepare and sign, without notarization, a written report and file it with the court within ten days of the completion of the examination. On receipt of the written report, the clerk of the court shall cause copies to be delivered immediately to the state\u2019s attorney and to counsel for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"AkK\">\u201c(e) hearing. The court shall hold a hearing as to the competency of the defendant no later than ten days after it receives the written report. Any evidence regarding the defendant\u2019s competency, including the written report, may be introduced at the hearing by either the defendant or the state. If the written report is introduced, at least one of the examiners must be present to testify as to the determinations in the report, unless his presence is waived by the defendant and the state. Any member of the clinical team shall be considered competent to testify as to the team\u2019s determinations. A defendant and his counsel may waive the court hearing only if the examiners, in the written report, determine without qualification that the defendant is competent.</p>\n<p id=\"AvD\">\u201c(f) COURT FINDING OF COMPETENCY OR INCOMPETENCY. If the court, after the hearing, finds that the defendant is competent, it shall continue with the criminal proceedings. If it finds that the defendant is not competent, it shall also find whether there is substantial probability that the defendant, if provided with a course of treatment, will regain competency within the maximum period of any placement order permitted under this section.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b257-8\"> In ruling on the motion in limine, the trial court, <em>Dunn, J., </em>did not engage in an evaluation like the one conducted in connection with the motion to dismiss.

Following the trial, the defendant made a motion for judgment of acquittal and again relied upon <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 391 F.2d 460.
