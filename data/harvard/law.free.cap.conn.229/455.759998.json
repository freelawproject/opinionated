The plaintiff, the Connecticut Resources Recovery Authority, brought an action to recover for the costs of cleanup of real property previously owned by the defendants, Refuse Gardens, Inc., and its officers, directors and shareholders. The plaintiff filed an application for a prejudgment remedy pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-278a et seq. on count four of its complaint, in which it sought reimbursement from the defendants under \u00a7 22a-452 (a). The trial court, after a hearing,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> denied the plaintiff\u2019s application and the plaintiff appealed to the Appellate Court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 <em>52-278l.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>We transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c). We affirm the ruling of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">The issue that divides the parties is the meaning of the phrase in \u00a7 22a-452 (a) that permits a private per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>son, firm, corporation or municipality to seek reimbursement from \u201cany person, firm or corporation\u201d for the costs of environmental restoration for pollution resulting \u201cfrom the <em>negligence or other actions </em>of such person, firm or corporation.\u201d (Emphasis added.) By contrast, General Statutes \u00a7 22a-451 (a)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> permits the commissioner of environmental protection to recover the costs of environmental restoration from \u201c[a]ny person, firm or corporation which <em>directly or indirectly causes </em>pollution and contamination of any land or waters of the state . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) The latter section permits the recovery of enhanced damages if a defendant\u2019s conduct was negligent or wilful. Both sections derive from No. 765 of the 1969 Public Acts. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>The trial court concluded that the legislature intended \u00a7 22a-452 (a) to require a showing of culpability and not merely causation. Because the plaintiff had not alleged such culpability on the part of the defendants, the court denied the plaintiffs application for a prejudgment remedy. <em>Connecticut Resources Recovery Authority </em>v. <em>Refuse Gardens, Inc., </em>43 Conn. Sup. 83, 642 A.2d 762 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">The plaintiff urges us to overturn the trial court\u2019s decision and to direct the granting of a prejudgment remedy. Our examination of the record on appeal, and the briefs and arguments of the parties, persuades us, however, that the decision of the trial court should be affirmed. The trial court carefully examined the language and the history of \u00a7 22a-452 (a) in light of the plaintiff\u2019s pleadings in this case. The trial court\u2019s thoughtful and comprehensive memorandum of decision fully states and meets the arguments raised by the parties on this appeal.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Accordingly, we adopt the trial court\u2019s well reasoned decision as a correct statement of the facts and the applicable law on the contested issue. It would serve no useful purpose for us to repeat <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>the discussion therein contained.

The amicus notes that private initiatives are especially important to assist the commissioner of environmental protection in times of strained personnel and financial resources. This argument might well persuade the legislature to broaden the scope of \u00a7 22a-452 (a), but it does not enable us to rewrite the text of the statute. Without clear statutory guidance, we cannot presume that the legislature intended to impose strict liability on former landowners. Even the imposition of liability for negligence on former landowners is a substantial deviation from the common law rule of caveat emptor. The common law rule continues to have vitality even though it has given way to liability for negligence in special cases such as those involving the defective construction of buildings or their appurtenances by builder-vendors of real property. <em>Coburn </em>v. <em>Lenox Homes, Inc., </em>186 Conn. 370, 375, 441 A.2d 620 (1982); <em>Scribner </em>v. <em>O\u2019Brien, Inc., </em>169 Conn. 389, 400, 363 A.2d 160 (1975); see generally 2 Restatement (Second), Torts \u00a7\u00a7 352 and 372 (1965); W.
