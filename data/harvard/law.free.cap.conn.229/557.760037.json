The defendant has appealed directly to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (b) (3).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He claims in his appeal that the trial court improperly: (1) precluded him from questioning the victim regarding a previous false accusation of sexual assault in violation of his right to confrontation; (2) admitted constancy of accusation evidence concerning the sexual assault; (3) admitted the victim\u2019s tape-recorded statement as constancy of accusation evidence; (4) defined reasonable doubt in the charge to the jury as <em>\u201ca </em>doubt for which a valid reason can be assigned,\u201d thereby diluting the state\u2019s burden of proof; and (5) charged the jury on first degree sexual assault in such a way as to allow the jury to convict him on a statutory alternative that was not supported by the evidence. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">The jury could reasonably have found the following facts. On August 18,1990, the victim, a seventeen year <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>old female, lived in New Haven with her mother and siblings. During the morning on that date, the defendant, the victim\u2019s uncle, came to the victim\u2019s home and asked that she go with him to tell his wife that he had been at the victim\u2019s home the previous night. The victim agreed. Consequently, at approximately noon, they left the victim\u2019s home to walk to the defendant\u2019s apartment. The victim took a shortcut and arrived at the defendant\u2019s third floor apartment before he did. When no one answered the door, she went downstairs to the first floor. The defendant appeared behind the victim in the first floor hallway and told her that the keys to his apartment were in the basement. When the victim told the defendant that she did not want to go down into the basement, he pulled her arms behind her and forced her toward the basement door. The defendant was holding a screwdriver in his hand. Although the door was usually locked, the lock had been broken. The victim, afraid and crying, asked the defendant what he was doing and begged him not to take her to the basement. Believing that no one was nearby, the victim did not call out or attempt to attract attention.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">Once in the basement, the defendant pushed the victim away from the stairs toward a darkened portion of the basement where he forced her down onto the dirt and rock floor. The defendant pinned the victim down and ordered her to remove her clothes and had intercourse with her. Subsequently, he ordered the victim to get dressed, and threatened to tie her up if she continued crying and screaming. The victim, in order to get away from the defendant, assured him that she would tell no one of the assault. The defendant released her.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">When released, however, the victim ran home and informed her mother of what had occurred. Thereafter, in response to a call about an alleged sexual assault, New Haven police officers arrived at the victim\u2019s home <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>and found her rolling on the floor in \u201chysterics\u201d and unable to answer questions. After being taken to the hospital by ambulance, she still could not respond to questions but did indicate that she would like to speak to a psychiatrist. Nonetheless, at the hospital, she was not fully responsive to the psychiatrist, an examining physician or a police detective. Although she answered some questions, she did not provide details of the assault. On the day of the incident, after she was discharged from the hospital, however, the victim did permit the police to record her statement. Approximately two months later, the victim also related the details of her encounter with the defendant to a nurse practitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">The defendant first argues that the trial court improperly precluded him from questioning the victim about what he contends was a previous false accusation of sexual assault. He asserts that the purpose of cross-examining the victim regarding a previous complaint that did not result in a prosecution was \u201cto show that [the victim] has no hesitancy in making complaints of sexual assault. . . .\u201d The defendant claims that the court\u2019s ruling deprived the jury of information necessary for it to determine the victim\u2019s credibility and improperly curtailed his cross-examination of the victim.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-8\">\u201cThe sixth amendment to the [United States] constitution guarantees the right of an accused in a criminal prosecution to confront the witnesses against him. . . . The primary interest served by confrontation is the right to cross-examination . . . and an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>important function of cross-examination is the exposure of a witness\u2019 motivation in testifying. . . . Cross-examination to elicit facts tending to show motive, interest, bias and prejudice is a matter of right and may not be unduly restricted.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Colton, </em>227 Conn. 231, 248-49, 630 A.2d 577 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">\u201cThe confrontation clause does not, however, suspend the rules of evidence to give the defendant the right to engage in unrestricted cross-examination.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>21 Conn. App. 291, 293, 573 A.2d 1218 (1990). Only relevant evidence may be elicited through cross-examination. <em>State </em>v. <em>Gaynor, </em>182 Conn. 501, 509, 438 A.2d 479 (1980). The court determines whether the evidence sought on cross-examination is relevant by determining whether that evidence \u201crenders the existence of [other facts] either certain or more probable.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>208 Conn. 365, 376, 545 A.2d 1048 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">In <em>Kelly, </em>we held that the fact that a man whom the victim had previously accused of sexual assault had been acquitted had no probative value in a subsequent sexual assault case against a different defendant. Id. We stated that the acquittal did \u201cnot make the charge of sexual assault against [the earlier defendant] or the charge against the defendant a \u2018recent contrivance,\u2019 \u2018imagination,\u2019 or \u2018sexual fantasy. . . .\u2019 \u201d Id., 377.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-8\">On the other hand, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Ouellette, </em>190 Conn. 84, 459 A.2d 1005 (1983), the victim was an eight year old child. In her statement to the police, the victim stated that she had been sexually assaulted by the defendant and the defendant\u2019s brother-in-law. Id., 87-88. The victim had not, however, previously mentioned being assaulted by the defendant\u2019s brother-in-law to anyone other than the police. Id., 103. We con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>eluded that the trial court\u2019s denial of the right to cross-examine the victim concerning this discrepancy was harmful error. Id., 103-104.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-4\">In the present case, the defendant presented no evidence to the trial court concerning the alleged prior false accusation of sexual assault. In his offer of proof, the defendant claimed to know the name of the previously accused individual, but he did not know exactly when the accusation had been made, why the accusation had not resulted in a prosecution, or even whether the previous accusation was false. The court therefore refused the defendant permission to question the victim regarding the truth or falsity of the prior accusation because his offer of proof was insufficient and because the proposed line of inquiry was not relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">Unlike the situation in <em>State </em>v. <em>Ouellette, </em>supra, 190 Conn. 84, the victim here had not mentioned a previous assault in her statements about the incident. Without evidence of the falsity of the prior accusation, therefore, the defendant cannot show the relevance of the proposed cross-examination. As in <em>State </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>supra, 208 Conn. 377, the victim\u2019s \u201c \u2018conduct with another man [has] no bearing on her conduct with this defendant or on the credibility of her testimony in this case.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">\u201cThe court has wide discretion to determine the scope of cross-examination. . . . Every reasonable presumption should be given in favor of the correctness of the court\u2019s ruling in determining whether there has been an abuse of discretion.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Hernandez, </em>224 Conn. 196, 208, 618 A.2d 494 (1992). The trial court did not abuse its discretion in disallowing the proposed cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b585-8\">The defendant next claims that the trial court improperly admitted constancy of accusation evidence. In addi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>tion to the testimony of the victim, the jury heard the victim\u2019s story from the victim\u2019s sister, the psychiatrist who treated the victim at the hospital, the admitting physician, a nurse practitioner and a police detective.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">The defendant claims that the constancy of accusation doctrine is \u201coutmoded, anachronistic and gender-biased\u201d and violates his rights under article first, \u00a7 20, of the Connecticut constitution.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> He also claims that the constancy of accusation testimony violated his right to confrontation under the sixth amendment to the United States constitution in that it does not fall within a recognized hearsay exception. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">At trial, the defendant claimed only that the constancy of accusation evidence violated his rights under the confrontation clause. He now seeks to prevail on the remainder of his claims under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b586-8\">The defendant has not demonstrated that his claim that the constancy of accusation doctrine is outmoded and clearly anachronistic is of constitutional dimension. The defendant, therefore, has not satisfied the second prong of the test set forth in <em>Golding. </em>The defendant may not prevail on this claim. The defendant also seeks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>to prevail under <em>Golding </em>on his claim that the constancy of accusation doctrine is gender biased and that it violated his rights under article first, \u00a7 20, of the Connecticut constitution. Although the constancy of accusation doctrine was adopted by this court in a case in which a female sexual assault victim had confided in a female friend; <em>State </em>v. <em>De Wolf, </em>8 Conn. 93, 100 (1830); we have never restricted its application to female victims. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Pierson, </em>201 Conn. 211, 514 A.2d 724 (1986) (victim was adolescent boy). Because the doctrine would apply equally to male and female victims, we conclude that it is not gender biased and, therefore, does not violate the defendant\u2019s rights under article first, \u00a7 20, of the Connecticut constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">The defendant also claims that the allowance of constancy of accusation testimony violated his right to confrontation. The admissibility of constancy of accusation evidence has consistently been approved by this court. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Parris, </em>219 Conn. 283, 289-90, 592 A.2d 943 (1991); <em>State </em>v. <em>Segerberg, </em>131 Conn. 546, 549, 41 A.2d 101 (1945); <em>State </em>v. <em>Kinney, </em>44 Conn. 153, 156-57 (1876). Constancy of accusation evidence is admissible \u201cwhen the complainant first has testified, in court, to the facts of the alleged occurrence .... She is then permitted to state that she made complaint to some other person. Thereupon, the person to whom she complained, out of court and in the absence of the defendant, is permitted to testify not only to the fact that a complaint was made but also to its details.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Segerberg, </em>supra, 548-49.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">In approving the admission of constancy of accusation testimony, we have explained that it would be natural for the victim of actual or attempted sexual assault to relate the incident to others if it had actually happened, but not if the incident had not occurred. Similarly, the victim\u2019s recitation of the details of the incident would likely be constant if the claim were true, but dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>crepancies would be more likely to appear if the incident had not occurred. <em>State </em>v. <em>Kinney, </em>supra, 44 Conn. 156-57.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">\u201cRather than disadvantaging a defendant, such a doctrine supplies a fertile field for cross-examination of a complainant with reference to ascertaining where the truth lies.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Dabkowski, </em>199 Conn. 193, 202, 506 A.2d 118 (1986). In addition to providing additional information on which the defendant can cross-examine the victim, the defendant can cross-examine the constancy of accusation witnesses. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Brigandi, </em>186 Conn. 521, 533, 442 A.2d 927 (1982). The defendant\u2019s right to confrontation, therefore, has not been violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">Additionally, constancy of accusation testimony is admissible only to corroborate the victim\u2019s testimony. <em>State </em>v. <em>Hamer, </em>188 Conn. 562, 565, 452 A.2d 313 (1982). \u201cConstancy evidence is properly viewed as a peculiar species of evidence, and, rather than further attempt to conform our traditionally liberal doctrine to evidentiary rules designed for other classes of evidence, we leave any curtailment of the doctrine to future cases where compelling reasons presented by litigants might persuade us to do so.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Parris, </em>supra, 219 Conn. 292. We have rejected challenges to the constancy of accusation doctrine in the past and are not persuaded now by the defendant\u2019s argument. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Dabkowski, </em>supra, 199 Conn. 203; <em>State </em>v. <em>Kish, </em>186 Conn. 757, 768, 443 A.2d 1274 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b588-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b588-9\">The defendant next challenges the admissibility of the victim\u2019s tape-recorded statement as constancy of accusation evidence. The defendant claims that admitting her tape-recorded statement enabled the victim to testify a second time without being cross-examined. In a discussion outside the presence of the jury, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>defendant conceded that a transcript of the statement would be admissible as constancy of accusation evidence. The defendant objected only to the jury hearing the statement in the victim\u2019s own voice. The court admitted the tape recording because the defendant presented no evidence to indicate that the recording was not \u201ca reliable preservation of what the witness said at the police department.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">It is immaterial that the constancy of accusation testimony was offered by the victim herself rather than by the person to whom she gave the statement. <em>State </em>v. <em>Hamer, </em>supra, 188 Conn. 565. The victim\u2019s tape-recorded statement is persuasive evidence of what she told the police when she was released from the hospital. See <em>State </em>v. <em>DePastino, </em>228 Conn. 552, 569, 638 A.2d 578 (1994); <em>State </em>v. <em>Bethea, </em>24 Conn. App. 13, 20, 585 A.2d 1235, cert. denied, 218 Conn. 901, 588 A.2d 1076 (1991). The defendant had the opportunity to cross-examine the victim about what she said on the tape, as well as the opportunity to cross-examine the officer about the circumstances under which her statement was recorded. The trial court, therefore, properly admitted the tape-recorded statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b589-8\">The defendant also claims that by defining a reasonable doubt as \u201ca doubt for which a valid reason can be assigned\u201d or as \u201ca doubt as in serious affairs which concern yourselves, you would pay heed,\u201d the trial court diluted the state\u2019s burden of proof in violation of his state and federal constitutional due process rights. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-9\">We have consistently upheld, against claims of constitutional error, the definition of a reasonable doubt as <em>\u201ca </em>doubt for which a valid reason may be assigned.\u201d See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>225 Conn. 270, 290-91, 623 A.2d 42 (1993); <em>State </em>v. <em>Derrico, </em>181 Conn. 151, 170-71, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>434 A.2d 356, cert. denied, 449 U.S. 1064, 101 S. Ct. 789, 66 L. Ed. 2d 607 (1980). Similarly, we have upheld the definition of a reasonable doubt as <em>\u201ca </em>doubt as in serious affairs which would concern yourselves, you would pay heed.\u201d See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Gomez, </em>225 Conn. 347, 353-54, 622 A.2d 1014 (1993); <em>State </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>214 Conn. 118, 119-20, 570 A.2d 1123 (1990).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">We have concluded that these definitions of reasonable doubt, when viewed in the context of an entire charge, do not dilute the state\u2019s burden of proof. The court\u2019s charge in the present case, when viewed in its entirety, clearly defined the proof beyond a reasonable doubt standard. The defendant\u2019s constitutional due process rights therefore were not violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b590-8\">Finally, the defendant claims that the court\u2019s charge on sexual assault in the first degree may have allowed the jury to convict him on a statutory alternative that was not supported by the evidence. Because the defendant did not preserve this claim at trial, he seeks to prevail under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 239-40.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-9\">The substitute information charged the defendant with compelling \u201canother person to engage in sexual intercourse by the use of force against her or by the threat of the use of force which reasonably caused her to fear physical injury. . . .\u201d The victim testified that the defendant had pulled her arms behind her back, had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>forced her down the basement stairs, had ordered her to be quiet, had forced her onto the dirt floor, had held his arm against her neck so that she could not escape, had told her to remove her undergarments, and had sexually assaulted her.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">The trial court instructed the jury: \u201cThe state does not have the burden to prove both the use of force and the threat of use of force. The state does have the burden to prove one or the other, that is, the defendant compelled [the victim] to engage in sexual intercourse at that time and place either by use of force against her or by threat of use of force against her which threat [of use of force] reasonably caused her to fear physical injury to herself.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">\u201cThe word threat has its ordinary meaning. Threat of use of force is any indication of a person\u2019s purpose or intention to use force against another person. Such an indication may be made in any manner, whether by words or conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-8\">\u201cThe state has the burden to prove that the defendant did either use force or threatened the use of force, which threat did reasonably cause [the victim] to fear impairment of her physical condition or did reasonably cause her to fear that she would receive pain.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-9\">\u201cIf upon all the evidence you find that the defendant did use force you need not consider whether he threatened her with the use of force. If, however, you find the defendant did not use force you shall then consider whether he threatened her with the use of force, which threat reasonably caused her to fear physical injury to herself.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b591-10\">We have recently concluded that instructing the jury on both forms of compulsion, even where the state has presented insufficient evidence of one alternative, is not a constitutional violation, but that it did constitute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>harmless error in that case. <em>State </em>v. Chapman, 229 Conn. 529, 544-48, 643 A.2d 1213 (1994). Because the defendant has not demonstrated that a constitutional violation \u201cclearly exists and clearly deprived [him] of a fair trial,\u201d he has failed to satisfy the third prong of <em>Golding. </em>Accordingly, he cannot prevail on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">In this opinion Peters, C. J., Callahan and Borden, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b580-16\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-92 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of kidnapping in the first degree when he abducts another person <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>and . . .

Indeed, the state had previously filed a motion in limine to prevent examination of the victim regarding this incident. On appeal, the state abandoned any reliance on the rape shield statute. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Cassidy, </em>3 Conn.

The primary interest secured by confrontation is the right to cross-examination; <em>Douglas </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>380 U.S. 415, 418, 85 S. Ct. 1074, 13 L.

App. 150, 152-54, 292 S.E.2d 741 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">The majority appears to reject the defendant\u2019s claim for two reasons. First, it relies on <em>State </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>208 Conn. 365, 545 A.2d 1048 (1988), but that case is inapposite. In <em>Kelly, </em>the defendant sought to introduce testimony to show that a person previously accused of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>sexual assault by the victim was acquitted of the charge. Id., 375. This is clearly irrelevant. In the present case, the defendant sought to cross-examine the victim in order to obtain an admission from her that she had previously made a false complaint of sexual assault against another person. <em>See State </em>v. <em>Nab, </em>245 Or. 454, 459, 421 P.2d 388 (1967) (\u201cThe rule is limited to the reception of evidence that the [complainant] had admitted the falsity of the charges or they had been disproved. <em>If, of course, she admits their falsity on the stand the evidence would be competent. \u201d </em>[emphasis added]); <em>Covington </em>v. <em>State, </em>703 P.2d 436, 442, reh. granted on other grounds, 711 P.2d 1183 (Alaska App. 1985) (cross-examination must be predicated on factual showing of falsity \u201cor where the witness [has] conceded . . . falsity\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">Furthermore, the rule in <em>Kelly </em>is qualified in a manner that makes crystal clear that this line of questioning was a proper subject of cross-examination. <em>\u201cUnless she had raised a false claim before, </em>her conduct with another man had no bearing on her conduct with this defendant or on the credibility of her testimony in this case.\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>supra, 208 Conn. 377; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Cassidy, </em>supra, 3 Conn. App. 382 (trial court \u201cwas correct in noting that, unless the proffered testimony was to show that the victim previously made a false claim of sexual assault following the claimed similar, consensual sexual conduct, the evidence should be excluded\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">Second, the majority suggests that the defendant was on a fishing expedition because he \u201cpresented no evidence to the trial court concerning the alleged prior false accusation of sexual assault.\u201d I agree that, generally, a defendant should not be allowed to cross-examine a complainant in a sexual assault case regarding a prior, allegedly false, accusation unless the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>defendant satisfies the trial court that there is a factual predicate for the claim. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bohannon, </em>supra, 376 Mass. 95; <em>State </em>v. <em>Demos, </em>94 Wash. 2d 733, 736-37, 619 P.2d 968 (1980). Indeed, we should adopt a rule requiring a defendant who wishes to pursue such a claim to obtain a preliminary ruling from the trial court. <em>Covington </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 703 P.2d 442.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">The defendant, however, indicated that he sought to question the victim regarding a false claim against a named third party whom he identified for the court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The state, by filing its motion in limine seeking to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>exclude the evidence, had conceded that there was a prior sexual encounter. Furthermore, the defendant offered to cut off the line of questioning should the complainant deny the existence or falsity of the prior accusation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Moreover, the defendant explained that any court records that might exist concerning the prior incident were not available to him, and therefore he could not make a complete preliminary showing.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> I recognize that the factual basis for falsity was thin, but because of the following circumstances of this case, the defendant should have been allowed to question the victim.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>There was no forensic medical evidence of forcible sexual intercourse and no other independent evidence that the defendant sexually assaulted the victim. The defendant claimed an alibi defense, and disclaimed any sexual contact with the victim. The only evidence linking the defendant to the alleged assault was the in-court and out-of-court statements of the victim. The out-of-court hearsay statements of the victim were admitted as constancy of accusation evidence through very credible witnesses\u2014a police officer, a nurse, a psychiatrist, and the examining physician. As if this was not enough, the trial court admitted into evidence the tape recording of the victim\u2019s out-of-court complaint to the police. Under these circumstances, it was crucial that the defendant be allowed liberal cross-examination of the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">Accordingly, I would hold that the trial court abused its discretion in not allowing the defendant to pursue his cross-examination of the victim, reverse the conviction and order a new trial. \u201c[T]he proffered question would have gone to the very heart of the witness\u2019 credibility. . . . The proffered cross-examination, if successful, could have cast sufficient doubt on the prosecuting witness\u2019 credibility to render her unworthy of belief in the mind of at least one juror. Therefore, the error in this case was harmful, and [the defendant\u2019s] conviction must be reversed.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Cox, </em>298 Md. 173, 184-85, 468 A.2d 319 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b597-8\">I continue to be concerned about the contours of the rule admitting constancy of accusation evidence in sexual assault cases. <em>State </em>v. <em>DePastino, </em>228 Conn. 552, 573, 638 A.2d 578 (1994) <em>(Berdon, J., </em>dissenting). In the present case, on appeal, the defendant argues that the rule is founded on premises that are anachronistic, outmoded, and sexist.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>The genesis of the rule in Connecticut is found in <em>State </em>v. <em>De Wolf, </em>8 Conn. 93, 100 (1830): \u201cIf a female testifies, that such an outrage has been committed on her person, an enquiry is, at once, suggested, why it was not communicated to her female friends. To satisfy such inquiry, it is reasonable that she should be heard in her declarations, that she did so communicate it, and that testimony should be received to confirm her story.\u201d This reasoning reflects the nineteenth century thinking that women were second class citizens who could not be believed without corroboration. This sexist attitude, a symptom of our nation\u2019s \u201clong and unfortunate history of sex discrimination\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>J. E. B. </em>v. <em>Alabama ex rel. T. B., </em>U.S. , 114 S. Ct. 1419, 1425, 128 L. Ed. 2d 89 (1994); was reinforced by the absolute exclusion of women from the judicial process at that time. \u201c[U]ntil the 19th century, women were completely excluded from jury service\u201d in the United States and \u201c[mjany States continued to exclude women from jury service well into the present century, despite the fact that women attained suffrage upon ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment in 1920.\u201d Id., 1422-23. There were no female members of the Connecticut bar until 1882. <em>In re Hall, </em>50 Conn. 131 (1882); see <em>Bradwell v. State, </em>83 U.S. 130, 141 (1872) (Bradley, J., concurring) (under \u201cthe law of the Creator,\u201d women were destined to \u201cfulfil the noble and benign offices of wife and mother\u201d and were \u2018 \u2018evidently [unfit] . . . for many of the occupations of civil life\u201d including law). Finally, there were no female members of the judiciary in Connecticut in 1830 and, in fact, there were none for the next 130 years.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In this social con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>text, it is not surprising that prosecutors needed something more than a woman\u2019s uncorroborated word to obtain a conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">In succeeding generations, ironically, the constancy rule broadened in scope even as inroads were made against sex discrimination. In 1876, the court allowed out-of-court revelations about the details of the sexual assault by complainants to be admitted. \u201cWhy has the rule been adopted that in prosecutions for rape, and for attempts to commit rape, the public prosecutor may show that the woman on whom the assault was made complained of it to her friends? It is simply because such a course would be natural if the crime had been committed, but very unnatural if it had not been. But her natural impulses would prompt her to tell all the details of the transaction. Why, on the same principle, ought not her statement of the details to be evidence? . . . If her story were true, the evidence would show constancy in the charge even to the details, and the truth [of her testimony] would the more clearly appear.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Kinney, </em>44 Conn. 153, 156-57 (1876).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">Although such evidence is arguably justified in certain circumstances as a form of prior consistent statement testimony, provided the requirements of that rule are met,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the admission of details, for all practical purposes, transforms the rule into \u201ca true hearsay exception, not just a rule of credibility.\u201d C. Tait &amp; J. LaPlante, Connecticut Evidence (2d Ed. 1988) \u00a7 11.22.1, p. 410; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Ouellette, </em>190 Conn. 84, 97, 459 A.2d 1005 (1983); <em>State </em>v. <em>Hamer, </em>188 Conn. 562, 565, 452 A.2d 313 (1982) (statements \u201cadmissible as an exception to the hearsay rule to corroborate the complainant\u2019s tes<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>timony by showing constancy of accusation\u201d).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In admitting the details, Connecticut stands nearly alone in modern American jurisprudence.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">Simply put, the hearsay exception of constancy of accusation is predicated on the assumption that unless the victim\u2014who in most instances is a female\u2014 announces to the world that she has been a victim of a sex crime, her credibility is suspect. Indeed, the majority endorses this justification when it states that \u201cit would be natural for the victim of actual or attempted sexual assault to relate the incident to others if it had actually happened, but not if the incident had not occurred.\u201d I find this rationale to be offensive. We do not engage in this reasoning with respect to any other crime involving an adult victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">Furthermore, the empirical assertion that an actual victim of sexual assault would naturally relate the incident to others stands in opposition to the real experiences of women reported in the literature. S. Estrich, \u201cRape,\u201d 95 Yale L.J. 1087,1088-89 (1986).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In addi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>tion, the second assumption underlying this empirical claim\u2014\u201cbut not if the incident had not occurred\u201d\u2014 defies common sense. If anything, the rule gives a person who has fabricated an assault an incentive to report the crime and its \u201cdetails\u201d to friends and acquaintances.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Therefore, constancy evidence not only has its origin in a sexist assumption, but allows inherently unreliable evidence to support a criminal conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">Nevertheless, I do not reach the ultimate issue of whether societal concerns have undermined the continued viability of the constancy of accusation rule in this state. I leave it to another day when the issue is appropriately raised before the trial court.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b593-8\"> The defendant also argued that the evidence would be admissible under the second exception to the rape shield law. See General Statutes \u00a7 54-86f (2) (admitting evidence of prior sexual conduct of the victim if it is \u201coffered by the defendant on the issue of credibility of the victim, provided the victim has testified on direct examination as to his or her sexual conduct\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b595-7\"> The following excerpt from the trial transcripts indicates the foundation for the questioning provided by the defendant.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-8\">\u201cMs. Lifton [Defense Counsel]: I would ask her . . . isn\u2019t it true that in addition to . . .

Estrich, supra, 95 Yale L.J. 1088-89; <em>see State </em>v. <em>Hill, 121 </em>N.J. 150, 158-59, 578 A.2d 370 (1990) (continued adherence to corroboration requirement \u201cwillfully ignored . . . the possibility that women would keep silent about rape because more than any other violent crime it could shed shame and embarrassment on the victim\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b601-9\"> On the other hand, this court has stated another justification for the rule. \u201cOur present doctrine of constancy of accusation facilitates the prosecution of an outrage which is almost always \u2018an inherently furtive act.\u2019 <em>People </em>v. <em>Linzy, </em>31 N.Y.2d 99, 103, 286 N.E.2d 440, 335 N.Y.S.2d 45 (1972).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Dabkowski, </em>199 Conn. 193, 202-203, 506 A.2d 118 (1986). I recognize the reality that sexual assault trials, when turning on credibility as in the present case, are not only difficult to defend, they are also difficult to prosecute. Nevertheless, the present case is evidence that this court has tipped the scales in favor of the prosecution because the defendant was prevented from effectively cross-examining the complainant and challenging her credibility, even after her credibility was bolstered by the admission of her tape-recorded statement and the testimony of the four witnesses through whom the hearsay statements were admitted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b601-10\"> The state points out that these societal concerns were not raised in the trial court. Although the defendant raised the validity of the constancy of accusation rule under the federal and state constitutions, I need not reach the issues in this dissent because I would reverse on the cross-examination issue. Neither do I reach the remaining issues discussed by the majority.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
