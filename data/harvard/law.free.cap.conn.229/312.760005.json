Because we conclude that \u00a7 53-301 violates substantive due process under article first, \u00a7 8, of the state constitution<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> we need not reach the plaintiffs\u2019 other state constitutional claims.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>The plaintiffs are nine motor vehicle dealerships located in Danbury.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> They instituted this suit in order to obtain a declaratory judgment<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> that \u00a7 53-301 is unconstitutional, and to enjoin the defendant commissioner of motor vehicles from enforcing the statute.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Subsequent to the filing of the suit, the trial court granted the Connecticut Automotive Trades Association, Inc. (CATA), and Tufano Motorcar, Inc., permission to join the suit as defendants. Thereafter, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint that sought only a declaratory judgment. The parties filed a joint stipulation of facts and petitioned the trial court to reserve three questions concerning the constitutionality of \u00a7 53-301<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>advice of this court.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The trial court granted the petition for reservation and approved the joint stipulation of facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">The following stipulated facts are relevant.

The plaintiffs would open for business on Sunday if they were permitted to do so. Section 53-301 has caused the plaintiffs to suffer economic loss in the form of lost potential profits from Sunday sales of new and used automobiles and trucks.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">Section 53-301 is one of the last vestiges of Connecticut\u2019s Sunday closing laws, some of which were first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>codified in 1650. <em>Caldor\u2019s, Inc. </em>v. <em>Bedding Barn, Inc., </em>177 Conn. 304, 306, 417 A.2d 343 (1979) <em>(Caldor\u2019s). </em>In <em>Caldor\u2019s, </em>we struck down the general Sunday closing law, General Statutes \u00a7 53-302a, as violative of substantive due process under our state constitution. The closing law at issue in this case, \u00a7 53-301, was originally adopted as \u00a7 1 of No. 614 of the 1957 Public Acts. Section 2 of this act contained the predecessor of \u00a7 53-302a. The plaintiffs claim that the substantive due process analysis developed in <em>Caldor\u2019s </em>for challenging Sunday closing laws under our state constitution requires us to strike down \u00a7 53-301. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">We recognize that a party challenging the constitutionality of a statute must prove its unconstitutionality beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Connecticut Building Wrecking Co. </em>v. <em>Carothers, </em>218 Conn. 580, 590, 590 A.2d 447 (1991); <em>Bartholomew </em>v. <em>Schweizer, </em>217 Conn. 671, 675, 587 A.2d 1014 (1991); <em>Zapata </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>207 Conn. 496, 508, 542 A.2d 700 (1988). While the courts may declare a statute to be unconstitutional, our power to do this should \u201cbe exercised with caution, and in no doubtful case.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Brennan\u2019s Liquors, </em>25 Conn. 278, 289 (1856). Every presumption is to be given in favor of the constitutionality of the statute. <em>State </em>v. <em>Floyd, </em>217 Conn. 73, 79, 584 A.2d 1157 (1991); <em>Bottom </em>v. <em>Westport, </em>209 Conn. 652, 657, 553 A.2d 576 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">The plaintiffs rely solely on state constitutional grounds to invalidate \u00a7 53-301. It is beyond dispute that we are not bound by federal precedents in interpreting our own state constitutional provisions. \u201c[F]ederal decisional law is not a lid on the protections guaranteed under our state constitution.\u201d <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Maher, </em>40 Conn. Sup. 394, 419, 515 A.2d 134 (1986). As we stated in <em>State </em>v. <em>Geisler, </em>222 Conn. 672, 684, 610 A.2d 1225 (1992), \u201cfederal constitutional and statutory law establishes a minimum national standard for the exercise of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>individual rights and does not inhibit state governments from affording higher levels of protection . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">Nevertheless, we are not precluded from using federal precedents in crafting a framework for state constitutional analysis and in interpreting state constitutional provisions. \u201cJust as it is wrong to assume that state constitutions are mere mirror images of the Federal Constitution, so it is wrong to assume that independent state constitutions share no principles with their federal counterpart. The interstices of open-ended state constitutions remain to be filled, and many of them will best be filled by adopting into state law, on a case-by-case basis, persuasive constitutional doctrines from federal law and from sister states.\u201d E. Peters, \u201cState Constitutional Law: Federalism in the Common Law Tradition,\u201d 84 Mich. L. Rev. 583, 592-93 (1986); see also <em>Daly </em>v. <em>DelPonte, </em>225 Conn. 499, 512-13, 624 A.2d 876 (1993) (\u201c[i]n the interpretation of our state constitution, we have often consulted the case law under the federal constitution . . .\u201d); <em>State v. Lamme, </em>216 Conn. 172, 184, 579 A.2d 484 (1990) (\u201c[t]he adoption of federal constitutional precedents that appropriately illuminate open textured provisions in our own organic document in no way compromises our obligation independently to construe the provisions of our state constitution\u201d). Furthermore, it is clear that our adoption, for purposes of state constitutional analysis, of an analytical framework used under the federal constitution does not preclude us from concluding that a statute that would be valid under the federal constitution is nevertheless invalid under our state constitution. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>227 Conn. 363, 377-87, 630 A.2d 1315 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">The due process clause of article first, \u00a7 8, like the similar provision in the federal fourteenth amendment, provides for varying levels of judicial review to deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>mine whether a state statute or regulation passes constitutional muster in terms of substantive due process. See <em>Daly </em>v. <em>DelPonte, </em>supra, 225 Conn. 513 (\u201cWe have held, in accordance with the federal frame of analysis, that state action concerning social and economic regulation will survive an equal protection challenge if it satisfies a rational basis test. ... If, however, state action invidiously discriminates against a suspect class or affects a fundamental right, the action passes constitutional muster under the state constitution only if it survives strict scrutiny.\u201d [citation omitted]); <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Maher, </em>supra, 40 Conn. Sup. 441-43 (recognizing that varying levels of judicial review are used depending on the nature of the right the statute or regulation impinges upon).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">We agree with the defendants that \u00a7 53-301 neither impairs a fundamental constitutional right nor targets a suspect class, either of which would require that this court apply strict scrutiny to determine whether the statute passes muster under our state constitution. <em>State Management Assn. of Connecticut, Inc. </em>v. <em>O\u2019Neill, </em>204 Conn. 746, 750, 529 A.2d 1276 (1987). Rather, because \u00a7 53-301 merely regulates a commercial activity\u2014the sale of motor vehicles on Sunday\u2014it must be reviewed \u201cin accordance with the rules that normally govern constitutional challenges of economic or social welfare legislation, by ascertaining whether the legislature has acted arbitrarily or irrationally.\u201d <em>Connecticut Education Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Tirozzi, </em>210 Conn. 286, 299, 554 A.2d 1065 (1989). Although great constitutional deference is afforded to the legislature, our state due process clause mandates that the legislature must limit the exercise of its police powers to preserving the public peace, health and morals. <em>In re Application of Clark, </em>65 Conn. 17, 40, 31 A. 522 (1894). \u201cThe court\u2019s function in examining the constitutional aspect of police legislation is to decide whether the purpose of the legis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>lation is a legitimate one and whether the particular enactment is designed to accomplish that purpose in a fair and reasonable way.\u201d <em>Pierce </em>v. <em>Albanese, </em>144 Conn. 241, 249, 129 A.2d 606, appeal dismissed, 355 U.S. 15, 78 S. Ct. 36,2 L. Ed. 2d 21 (1957). Even under this less exacting test of constitutionality, an economic regulation will survive a substantive due process test only if it is both rational and related to a legitimate state purpose. <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>193 Conn. 93, 105, 475 A.2d 289 (1984); <em>Caldor\u2019s, </em>supra, 177 Conn. 315. \u201cIf an enactment meets this test, it satisfies the constitutional requirements of due process . . . . <em>Schwartz </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>140 Conn. 176, 179, 99 A.2d 89 [1953]; <em>Carroll </em>v. <em>Schwartz, </em>127 Conn. 126, 129, 14 A.2d 754 [1940].\u201d <em>Pierce </em>v. <em>Albanese, </em>supra, 249.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">As the first step in our state constitutional analysis, we must ascertain the legislative purpose behind \u00a7 53-301 in order to evaluate whether the statute is rationally related to that purpose. As noted above, \u00a7 53-301 is one of the Sunday closing laws and was originally adopted in the same legislation; Public Acts 1957, No. 614; as the general closing law struck down in <em>Caldor\u2019s. </em>In <em>Caldor\u2019s, </em>supra, 177 Conn. 310, we determined that the purpose of these closing laws was to create a common day of rest. \u201cAlthough in origin such laws were intimately related to the establishment of religious principles, over time their acknowledged purpose and justification have shifted to secular grounds.\u201d Id., 306. In an attempt to avoid the state constitutional principles developed in <em>Caldor\u2019s </em>for analyzing closing law legislation, the defendants claim that we should speculate concerning other conceivable purposes for the statute.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>As early as the turn of the century, when religious observance was still an acknowledged purpose for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>closing laws, this court made clear that such laws were also designed to secure to private citizens the quiet enjoyment of Sunday as a day of rest. <em>Wetherell </em>v. <em>Hollister, </em>73 Conn. 622, 625, 48 A. 826 (1901). We have reiterated this secular purpose in more modern times. See <em>Caldor\u2019s, </em>supra, 177 Conn. 306; <em>State </em>v. <em>Shuster, </em>145 Conn. 554, 557-58, 145 A.2d 196 (1958); <em>State </em>v. <em>Hurliman, </em>143 Conn. 502, 507, 123 A.2d 767 (1956). In view of these judicial pronouncements, we presume that the legislature has \u201cknowledge of this longstanding construction which this court has given to the objective and purpose of legislation in this field.\u201d <em>Klapproth </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>156 Conn. 276, 279, 240 A.2d 886 (1968); see also <em>Cappellino </em>v. <em>Cheshire, </em>226 Conn. 569, 576, 628 A.2d 595 (1993) (\u201c \u2018the legislature is presumed to be aware of the judicial construction placed upon its enactments\u2019 \u201d). We also presume that the legislature is aware of the effect that its action or inaction will have on an existing statute, and to intend the effect that its action or inaction produces. <em>All Brand Importers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Liquor Control, </em>213 Conn. 184, 197, 567 A.2d 1156 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">The legislature has not done anything to indicate that \u00a7 53-301 has a separate purpose from the other Sunday closing laws, or that the purpose of these laws is not a common day of rest. We must therefore reaffirm the long-standing construction that this court has given to the purpose of the closing laws\u2014that is, \u201cto further a common day of rest.\u201d <em>Caldor\u2019s, </em>supra, 177 Conn. 325. Because an act with such a purpose \u201ccannot be justified by other unspecified governmental, economic, or social reasons\u201d; id.; we will not speculate as to other conceivable purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">The courts have recognized that providing a common day of rest for citizens is a legitimate governmental interest. <em>McGowan </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>366 U.S. 420, 445, 81 S. Ct. 1101, 6 L. Ed. 2d 393 (1961); <em>Caldor\u2019s, </em>supra, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>177 Conn. 306. That does not, however, end our constitutional inquiry, because we must determine whether the prohibition of the sale of motor vehicles on Sunday bears a reasonable relationship to that purpose. In <em>Caldor\u2019s, </em>we recognized the difficulty in making this inquiry. \u201cBecause any statement of the rational connection test is necessarily general and open-ended, controversy tends, as in this case, to concern not the test itself but rather its application.\u201d <em>Caldor\u2019s, </em>supra, 315. Accordingly, in performing our substantive due process analysis under the state constitution, we borrow from the teachings of procedural due process in examining the \u201ctotality of circumstances that bear on the rationality\u201d of the statute. Id., 316.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">In this case, as in <em>Caldor\u2019s, </em>there are three aspects of the Sunday closing law at issue that warrant special emphasis in examining the totality of circumstances. First, as the parties concede, \u00a7 53-301 is a penal statute. Motor vehicle dealers who violate the statute are subject both to fines and to possible suspension of their dealer\u2019s licenses. As a penal statute, \u00a7 53-301 must be strictly construed. Id., 318.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">Second, \u00a7 53-301 regulates conduct that would be entirely legitimate in the absence of the statute. We noted in <em>Caldor\u2019s, </em>supra, 177 Conn. 317, that \u201c[t]o be constitutionally valid, legislation policing the operation of a legitimate business must serve some phase of the public health, safety, convenience and welfare in a reasonable and impartial way.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) See <em>also Mott\u2019s Super Markets, Inc. </em>v. <em>Frassinelli, </em>148 Conn. 481, 487, 172 A.2d 381 (1961) (invalidating, under the due process clause of the state constitution, a provision of the Unfair Sales Practices Act that provided that proof that a retailer had sold or offered to sell goods below cost would be prima facie evidence of an intent to destroy competition); <em>United Interchange, Inc. </em>v. <em>Spellacy, </em>144 Conn. 647, 654, 136 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>A.2d 801 (1957) (invalidating, under the due process and equal protection provisions of the state constitution, a statute requiring individuals who solicit advertisements for real estate periodicals to obtain real estate licenses). While \u201cthe legislature has a broad discretion\u201d in fashioning economic legislation, the courts must limit this discretion \u2018 \u2018at that point where the regulatory measures either fail to serve the public good or serve it in a despotic way.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Caldor\u2019s, </em>supra, 317; see also <em>Mott\u2019s Super Markets, Inc. </em>v. <em>Frassinelli, </em>supra, 487; <em>United Interchange, Inc. </em>v. <em>Spellacy, </em>supra, 654. \u201c[Regulations imposed on a lawful business cannot exceed what is reasonably necessary to accomplish their purpose,\u201d especially where the regulation imposes penal sanctions for conduct that does not carry \u201cany antisocial implications whatsoever.\u201d <em>Caldor\u2019s, </em>supra, 318; see also <em>Mott\u2019s Super Markets, Inc. </em>v. <em>Frassinelli, </em>supra, 487.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">Third, as we recognized in <em>Caldor\u2019s, </em>supra, 177 Conn. 319, difficulties inhere in legislation designed to provide a common day of rest. As a Sunday closing law, \u00a7 53-301 \u201cfurthers an objective that is difficult to effectuate with clarity and precision.\u201d Id., 316. In <em>Caldor\u2019s, </em>the fact that the legislature had provided numerous exemptions from the general closing law led us to conclude that the statute failed to effectuate, in a rational manner, the objective of providing a common day of rest. Id., 324-25. The difficulty in discerning a rational connection between the statute and its objective is even more pronounced in this case, because the legislature has failed to reenact a general Sunday closing law. As a result, almost all commercial enterprises other than motor vehicle dealerships are permitted to open for business on Sunday. Indeed, it appears that, since <em>Caldor\u2019s, </em>the legislature has completely abandoned the difficult task of providing a common day of rest for the people of Connecticut.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>In view of the totality of circumstances set forth above, we conclude that the plaintiffs have proven beyond a reasonable doubt that \u00a7 53-301 is arbitrary and therefore violates article first, \u00a7 8, of our state constitution. The current statutory scheme fails to provide a common day of rest for Connecticut\u2019s people, and we cannot discern any legitimate reason for providing a common day of rest for one narrow class of employees,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> or, in regard to consumers, from one specific type of purchase.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Furthermore, \u00a7 53-301 may actually harm the public by making it inconvenient and difficult for people to comparison shop for motor vehicles at different dealerships. For example, the defendants concede that many couples prefer to shop together for a car, but only have time to do so on Sundays and in the evenings. Because \u00a7 53-301 prevents them from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>shopping on Sundays, they are limited to evenings and probably to the dealerships closest to their homes or places of business. Such anticompetitive effects harm all consumers.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\">The second reserved question\u2014that is, does \u00a7 53-301 violate the plaintiffs\u2019 rights to due process of law guaranteed by article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution?\u2014is answered in the affirmative. The case is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">No costs will be taxed in this court to any party.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b335-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53-301 provides: \u201cNo person, firm or corporation engaged in the business of buying, selling, exchanging, dealing or trading in new or used motor vehicles shall open any place of business or lot wherein he attempts to or does engage in the business of buying, selling, exchanging, dealing or trading in new or used motor vehicles, or buy, sell, exchange, deal or trade in new or used motor vehicles as a business on Sunday.

The defendants do not challenge this finding, which is critical to establishing the trial court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction. <em>Serrani </em>v. <em>Board of Ethics, </em>225 Conn. 305, 308, 622 A.2d 1009 (1993); see also <em>Salamandra </em>v. <em>Kozlowski, </em>173 Conn. 136, 138, 376 A.2d 1103 (1977) (failure to provide the requisite notice in a declaratory judgment action deprives the trial court of subject matter jurisdiction).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b336-8\"> In the original complaint, John M.

Therefore, the fact that the DMV is closed on Sunday does not furnish a rational purpose for the closing law. This is especially true in light of the parties\u2019 stipulation that Saturday is the busiest day of the week for motor vehicle dealers, and is also a day when the DMV is open only in the morning. Furthermore, this \u201cpurpose\u201d is more like an observation, and the defendants do not explain how the closing law advances the purpose of comprehensively regulating dealers.</p>\n<p id=\"AId\">The second purpose is that \u201cmotor vehicles are unlike most other consumer products because of their cost.\u201d The defendants claim that allowing dealerships to open seven days a week could lead to higher overhead without significantly higher sales and therefore to lower dealer profits, higher consumer prices, or both, and that the legislature may have wanted to avoid this. The defendants have stipulated, however, that if dealers could open on Sunday, it would be their second busiest and most profitable day after Saturday. If the legislature were truly seeking to hold down dealer overhead through the-mechanism of a closing law, it would force dealers to close on a weekday when sales are slower, rather than on Sunday.</p>\n<p id=\"ATU\">Third, the defendants claim that allowing dealers to open on Sunday as well as Saturday \u201cwould create an intolerable burden on DMV employees, as they attempted to process all of the new and transferred registrations in a timely manner on Tuesdays . . . .\u201d The defendants have not placed any facts on the record concerning the burden on DMV employees and how Sunday vehicle sales would affect them. Furthermore, the defendants have stipulated that: (1) the DMV has an automated registration system that permits motor vehicles to be registered when the DMV is closed; and (2) in the \u201cvast majority of instances,\u201d dealers do not deliver vehicles to customers on the day they are sold. These two facts, which are on the record, wholly undermine the defendants\u2019 unsupported claim that allowing dealers to open on Sunday would create an \u201cintolerable burden\u201d for the DMV.</p>\n<p id=\"A_q\">Finally, the defendants claim that prohibiting dealers from opening on Sundays makes it easier for DMV personnel to make unannounced site inspections, because they have only six days to cover instead of seven. This claim makes no sense, however, unless DMV personnel must inspect every dealership every day. To the contrary, having seven days available on which to make inspections instead of six would provide DMV personnel with greater flexibility in scheduling inspections and allow a greater number of inspections to be accomplished each week.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b346-5\"> The defendant commissioner of motor vehicles claims that \u201c[General Statutes] \u00a7 53-301 may have been designed to further a day of rest specifically for the operators and employees in the highly regulated, highly competitive business of motor vehicle sales.\u201d This objective is accomplished, however, by General Statutes \u00a7 53-303e (a), which provides that no employer may \u201ccompel any employee engaged in any commercial occupation . . . to work more than six days in any calendar week . . . .\u201d The defendants do not offer any persuasive reason why the legislature would conclude that a <em>common </em>day of rest is needed for employees of motor vehicle dealerships, beyond the mere fact that a majority of full-time dealership employees would prefer not to work on Sunday. Presumably, there are many people in the state of Connecticut who would prefer not to work on Sunday. The defendants have failed, however, to offer a rational reason why the legislature would single out this one group of employees for special protection.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b346-6\"> The defendants Connecticut Automotive Trades Association, Inc., and Tufano Motorcar, Inc., claim that the legislature \u201cmight rationally find that there should be a day of rest for such a major transaction\u201d because \u201csome transactions associated with purchasing a motor vehicle, such as arranging insurance and financing, generally cannot be accomplished on Sundays.\u201d This claim makes no sense, however, in light of the defendants\u2019 concession that even though insurance and many financing companies are closed on Saturdays and in the evening, motor vehicle dealerships may and do open for business at these times. Furthermore, the defendants concede that other major consumer goods\u2014such as boats, homes and jewelry\u2014are bought and sold on Sundays. In many cases, the purchase of these goods, too, involves financing and insurance arrangements.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
