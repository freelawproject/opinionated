In a probation revocation hearing, the trial court found that the defendant had violated a condition of his probation, and revoked the defendant\u2019s probation. The Appellate Court affirmed the judgment of the trial court, with one judge, <em>Freedman, J., </em>dissenting. <em>State </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>29 Conn. App. 801, 813, 618 A.2d 557 (1993). We granted the defendant\u2019s petition for certification,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and we now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">In June, 1990, the defendant, Wayde Davis, pleaded guilty to and was convicted of the offense of failure to appear in the first degree, in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-172. He was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of two years, execution suspended, and was placed on two years probation. At the time of sentencing, the defendant agreed to the standard terms of probation established by the office of adult probation, including the condition that he not violate any criminal law.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">In September, 1990, while on probation, the defendant was arrested and charged with burglary in the second degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-102, criminal mischief in the third degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-117, and possession of narcotics in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 21a-279. He was subsequently arrested on a warrant for violation of probation under General Statutes \u00a7 53a-32.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>held a probation revocation hearing pursuant to \u00a7 53a-32. At the hearing, Hartford police officer Thomas Sutton testified that he had been dispatched to an apartment complex on a report of burglary, and had entered an apartment building through a rear door \u201creported to have been broken.\u201d He testified that the door and the lock on the door appeared to have been damaged. He then entered the basement of the building through another door, which also appeared to have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>been damaged, and discovered in the basement the defendant and another man, Robert Graves. The defendant was holding a spoon containing white powder. Smith determined that Graves lived in the apartment building. Sutton arrested both men for burglary, criminal mischief for the damage to the door, and possession of drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">The trial court found that the defendant had violated the terms of his probation by committing the crimes of burglary in the second degree and criminal mischief in the third degree.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The trial court revoked the defendant\u2019s probation and ordered the defendant to serve his two year sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">The defendant appealed from the judgment of revocation of his probation to the Appellate Court, claiming that there was insufficient evidence presented to the trial court to find that he had violated a condition of his probation. <em>State </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>supra, 29 Conn. App. 802. In its review of this claim, the Appellate Court decided that the applicable standard of proof for probation revocation proceedings under \u00a7 53a-32 was that of reasonable satisfaction, which it characterized as a lesser standard than the fair preponderance standard. Id., 810. The Appellate Court then reviewed the evidence presented to the trial court and held that it met the reasonable satisfaction standard as defined by that court. Id., 812-13.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">We agree with the Appellate Court that, under \u00a7 53a-32, a probation revocation hearing has two distinct components. Id., 805. The trial court must first conduct an adversarial evidentiary hearing to determine whether the defendant has in fact violated a condition of probation. \u201cAt such hearing the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>shall be informed of the manner in which he is alleged to have violated the conditions of his probation or conditional discharge, shall be advised by the court that he has the right to retain counsel and, if indigent, shall be entitled to the services of the public defender, and shall have the right to cross-examine witnesses and to present evidence in his own behalf.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 53a-32 (a). If the trial court determines that the evidence has established a violation of a condition of probation, then it proceeds to the second component of probation revocation, the determination of whether the defendant\u2019s probationary status should be revoked. On the basis of its consideration of \u201cthe whole record,\u201d the trial court \u201cmay continue or revoke the sentence of probation or conditional discharge or modify or enlarge the conditions, and, if such sentence is revoked, require the defendant to serve the sentence imposed or impose any lesser sentence.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 53a-32 (b). In making this second determination, the trial court is vested with broad discretion. <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>207 Conn. 152, 167, 540 A.2d 679 (1988) (\u201c[a] defendant who seeks to reverse the exercise of judicial discretion, assumes a heavy burden\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">In this appeal, we are not concerned with the trial court\u2019s discretionary determination of whether probation was properly revoked under all the circumstances. We are concerned only with the first component, that is, the determination of whether there has been a violation of a condition of probation. Specifically, we must decide what standard of proof the trial court must apply to the evidence presented at the revocation hearing in order to determine whether a violation of probation has occurred. The defendant argues that, as a matter of statutory interpretation of \u00a7 53a-32, the state must /meet the burden of establishing a violation of probation by the fair preponderance of the evidence pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>sented at the revocation hearing.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The fair preponderance standard requires that the \u201cevidence induc[e] in the mind of the trier a reasonable belief that it is more probable than otherwise that the fact in issue is true.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Lopinto </em>v. <em>Haines, </em>185 Conn. 527, 533, 441 A.2d 151 (1981). On the other hand, the state argues that only \u201ca minimum level of certainty\u201d is required to find a violation, and that we should adopt the reasonable satisfaction standard. As defined by the Appellate Court, this standard is met by evidence producing \u201ca rational belief of a trial court that the evidence is adequate or sufficient to prove a violation.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>supra, 29 Conn. App. 811.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>This court has provided little guidance in the past as to the burden of proof governing probation violation determinations, other than the statement that the applicable standard is \u201csubstantially lower than that for conviction.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Roberson, </em>165 Conn. 73, 80, 327 A.2d 556 (1973). While we have stated in the past that the trial court must be \u201creasonably satisfied\u201d that a violation has occurred; id.; <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>supra, 207 Conn. 167; we have never specifically addressed the qualitative nature of the burden of persuasion required of the state in a revocation proceeding. Our reference to the reasonable satisfaction standard in <em>Smith </em>was not only dictum, but the standard was never defined, because the defendant Smith admitted to the trial court that he had violated his probation. <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>supra, 156-57. Similarly, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Roberson, </em>supra, 74, we were not required to set out a standard of proof for weighing conflicting evidence at a probation revocation hearing, but instead addressed the narrow issue of whether proof of a criminal conviction in a prior proceeding while on probation, standing alone, is sufficient evidence of a violation of probation. Finally, although the Appellate Court applied the reasonable satisfaction standard in <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>11 Conn. App. 251, 258, 527 A.2d 250 (1987), and <em>Payne </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>10 Conn. App. 395, 403, 523 A.2d 917 (1987), aff'd, 207 Conn. 565, 541 A.2d 504, cert. denied, 488 U.S. 898, 109 S. Ct. 242, 102 L. Ed. 2d 230 (1988), it did not define reasonable satisfaction in qualitative terms in those cases. Accordingly, we decide this case with a clean slate.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">The only language of the statute bearing on the state\u2019s burden of proving a violation of probation is that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>the trial court must find that \u201csuch violation is established by reliable and probative evidence.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 53a-32 (b). We agree with the Appellate Court that \u00a7 53a-32 is silent with regard to the applicable standard of proof, as the \u201creliable and probative\u201d language \u201cconcerns the nature of the evidence to be considered but is unrelated to the standard of proof that the court should apply in deciding the factual question of whether a violation of probation has occurred.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>supra, 29 Conn. App. 807. Although we look to legislative history for guidance when a statute is silent as to a matter clearly encompassed in the purview of that statute; <em>In re Valerie D., </em>223 Conn. 492, 512-13, 613 A.2d 748 (1992); the state correctly points out that there is no legislative history indicating an intention to establish any particular standard of proof with respect to probation revocation hearings.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">The function of the burden of proof employed by the court is to \u201callocat[e] the risk of error between the litigants and indicat[e] the relative importance of the ultimate decision. <em>Addington </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>441 U.S. 418, 423, 99 S. Ct. 1804, 1808, 60 L. Ed. 2d 323 (1979). . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Cookson </em>v. <em>Cookson, </em>201 Conn. 229, 234, 514 A.2d 323 (1986). \u201cFor example, the proof beyond a reasonable doubt standard implies that the party on whom that burden is imposed should bear almost the entire risk of error. . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. \u201cProof by clear and convincing evidence is an intermediate standard generally used in civil cases involving allegations of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>fraud or some other quasi-criminal wrongdoing, or when particularly important individual rights are involved. . . .\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. The preponderance of the evidence standard \u201cindicates that the litigants should share equally the risk of error . . . because the interests at stake have roughly equal societal importance. . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">Although we do not decide the constitutional issue raised by the defendant, we must examine the issue of the applicable standard of proof for probation revocation proceedings in the context that the privilege of probation, once granted, is a constitutionally protected interest. \u201cThe due process clause of the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution requires that certain minimum procedural safeguards be observed in the process of revoking the conditional liberty created by probation. <em>Black </em>v. <em>Romano, </em>471 U.S. 606, 610, 105 S. Ct. 2254, 85 L. Ed. 2d 636 (1985); see <em>Morrissey </em>v. <em>Brewer, </em>408 U.S. 471, 489, 92 S. Ct. 2593, 33 L. Ed. 2d 484 (1972).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Durkin, </em>219 Conn. 629, 635, 595 A.2d 826 (1991). This is so because \u201cthe loss of liberty entailed is a serious deprivation requiring that the [probationer] be accorded due process.\u201d <em>Gagnon v. Scarpelli, </em>411 U.S. 778, 781, 93 S. Ct. 1756, 36 L. Ed. 2d 656 (1973). \u201cAmong other things, due process entitles a probationer to a final revocation hearing under the conditions set forth in <em>Morrissey </em>v. <em>Brewer, </em>supra<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> . . . see <em>Gagnon </em>v. <em>Scarpelli, </em>[supra, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>782]; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Roberson, </em>[supra, 165 Conn. 81-82]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Crawford, </em>38 Conn. Sup. 472, 474-75, 451 A.2d 583 (1982); see generally General Statutes \u00a7 53a-32 (a).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Durkin, </em>supra, 635.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">On the other hand, \u201c \u2018[although a [probation] revocation proceeding must comport with the requirements of due process, it is not a criminal proceeding' <em>Minnesota </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>465 U.S. 420, 435 n.7, 104 S. Ct. 1136, 79 L. Ed. 2d 409, reh. denied, 466 U.S. 945, 104 S. Ct. 1932, 80 L. Ed. 2d 477 (1984).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Durkin, </em>supra, 219 Conn. 636 n.8. It therefore \u201cdoes not require all of the procedural components associated with an adversary criminal proceeding. <em>Gagnon </em>v. <em>Scarpelli, </em>supra [411 U.S. 783 n.5, 788-89]; <em>Morrissey </em>v. <em>Brewer, </em>supra, [408 U.S. 480, 489] . . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>supra, 207 Conn. 177.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">We conclude today, on the basis of the following reasons, that the state has the burden of establishing a violation of probation by a fair preponderance of the evidence under \u00a7 53a-32. First, we agree with those authorities that hold that the probation revocation procedure established by \u00a7 53a-32 is akin to a civil proceeding. See <em>Turner </em>v. <em>State, </em>784 S.W.2d 342, 344 (Mo. App. 1990); <em>State </em>v. <em>Hodges, </em>798 P.2d 270, 278 (Utah App. 1990). Therefore, our determination is guided by the general rule that when a civil statute is silent as to the applicable standard of proof, the preponderance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>of the evidence standard governs factual determinations required by that statute. See <em>Freeman </em>v. <em>Alamo Management Co., </em>221 Conn. 674, 678, 607 A.2d 370 (1992); <em>Mallory </em>v. <em>Mallory, </em>207 Conn. 48, 52, 53, 539 A.2d 995 (1988) (fair preponderance is \u201cthe ordinary civil standard of proof\u201d). This general rule is properly applied to probation revocation proceedings. <em>Wink </em>v. <em>State, </em>317 Md. 330, 334, 563 A.2d 414 (1989); <em>Turner </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 344; <em>State </em>v. <em>Hodges, </em>supra (analogizing probation conditions to a contract between the state and the court; \u201c[a]s in a contract dispute, proof of breach by the probationer is properly subject to a preponderance of evidence standard\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">We have applied this general rule to statutes that affect other important interests that are not purely financial. <em>Verrastro </em>v. <em>Middlesex Ins. Co., </em>207 Conn. 179, 183, 540 A.2d 693 (1988) (proof of criminal activity as element of a civil action); <em>Mallory </em>v. <em>Mallory, </em>supra, 207 Conn. 52-53 (determination of whether a parent has sexually abused a child for the purposes of child custody modification); <em>Lavertue </em>v. <em>Niman, </em>196 Conn. 403, 407, 493 A.2d 213 (1985) (general rule applied to paternity actions despite their \u201c \u2018quasicriminar overtones\u201d); <em>Lombardo </em>v. <em>State, </em>172 Conn. 385, 390-91, 374 A.2d 1065 (1977) (petition for a new trial following a criminal conviction on grounds of newly discovered evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">Second, adoption of the fair preponderance standard best furthers the interests of the probationer and the state in the revocation proceeding. Of course, the probationer is interested in maintaining his or her liberty. Nevertheless, one of the primary purposes of probation is to promote the rehabilitation of the probationer. <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>supra, 207 Conn. 164; <em>Belden </em>v. <em>Hugo, </em>88 Conn. 500, 504, 91 A. 369 (1914). Because both society and the probationer share an interest in a successful rehabilitative process, the state, as well as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>probationer, has an interest in a <em>reliable </em>determination of whether probation has been violated. <em>Payne </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>207 Conn. 565, 574, 541 A.2d 504, cert. denied, 408 U.S. 898, 109 S. Ct. 242, 102 L. Ed. 2d 230 (1988) (rational basis for admission of evidence otherwise subject to exclusionary rule exists, because \u201cthe state has a legitimate interest in <em>accurate </em>factfinding in probation revocation proceedings\u201d [emphasis added]); see <em>Gagnon </em>v. <em>Scarpelli, </em>supra, 411 U.S. 785 (\u201c[b]oth the probationer . . . and the State have interests in the accurate finding of fact and the informed use of discretion\u201d); <em>Morrissey </em>v. <em>Brewer, </em>supra, 408 U.S. 484.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">The important interests in the probationer\u2019s liberty and rehabilitation must be balanced, however, against the need to protect the public. Accordingly, probation is granted subject to conditions \u201cmeant to assure that the probation serves as a period of genuine rehabilitation and that the community is not harmed by the probationer\u2019s being at large.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>supra, 207 Conn. 165; see <em>Gagnon v. Scarpelli, </em>supra, 411 U.S. 785; <em>Morrissey </em>v. <em>Brewer, </em>supra, 408 U.S. 478. Therefore, \u201cthe government\u2019s interest is not confined to \u2018unnecessarily interrupting a successful effort at rehabilitation.\u2019 The government also has an important interest in not \u2018imprudently prejudicing the safety of the community.\u2019 \u201d <em>Harris </em>v. <em>United States, </em>612 A.2d 198, 207 (D.C. App. 1992), quoting <em>Gagnon </em>v. <em>Scarpelli, </em>supra, 785. We agree with other courts that have held that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>the sometimes competing and sometimes coinciding interests of the probationer and the state are best balanced by the preponderance of the evidence standard. <em>People </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>51 Cal. 3d 437, 445-46, 795 P.2d 783, 272 Cal. Rptr. 613 (1990); <em>Harris </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 207 (\u201cthe application of the preponderance standard . . . most appropriately protects the interests of both the government and the probationer\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]); see also H. Fisher, \u201cProbation and Parole Revocation Procedures after <em>Morrissey </em>and <em>Gagnon, \u201d </em>65 J. Crim. L. and Criminology 46, 61 (1974) (advocating preponderance of evidence standard as a minimum standard for revocation hearings).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">Finally, it is unlikely that the legislature would have provided for the substantial adversarial safeguards in \u00a7 53a-32, including the right to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses, as well as the right to counsel for every probationer, without also intending that the standard of proof governing these proceedings be more reliable than mere reasonable satisfaction as defined by the Appellate Court. That standard, allowing a trial court to find a violation of probation although the evidence presented at the revocation hearing merely produces a rational belief that the probationer violated a condition of probation, is inconsistent with these procedural safeguards.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">Our conclusion is buttressed by the overwhelming number of states that utilize the preponderance of the evidence standard in the determination of whether probation has been violated. The majority of states (twenty-six) and the District of Columbia currently utilize the preponderance of the evidence standard;<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> four <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>states apply a higher standard;<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and nine apply the reasonable satisfaction standard or a lower stan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>dard.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Although nearly all of the federal Circuit Courts use a standard labeled reasonable satisfaction,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> only two Circuit Courts have indicated, as did our Appellate Court, that this standard can be met upon less evidence than a preponderance.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Indeed, at least one state Supreme Court has determined that the reasonable satisfaction standard is the same as the preponderance standard. <em>Wink </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 317 Md. 340-41.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>The state argues that this court should not adopt a preponderance of the evidence standard because \u201cit would import a full-blown evidentiary hearing standard into a proceeding that should remain informal and flexible.\u201d Of course, the ultimate determination of whether probation should be revoked must be flexible and allow for a great degree of discretion in the trial court. <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>supra, 207 Conn. 167. \u201c \u2018 \u201cThe success of probation as a correctional tool is in large part tied to the flexibility within which it is permitted to operate.\u201d [ABA Project on Standards for Criminal Justice, Standards Relating to Probation (1970) \u00a7 3.3, commentary].\u2019 <em>Buckley v. Quincy Division of District Court Dept., </em>395 Mass. 815, 818, 482 N.E.2d 511 (1985).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>supra, 171.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">We disagree with the state, however, that adoption of a fair preponderance standard for determining whether a violation has occurred will adversely affect the flexibility and broad discretion that the trial court must exercise in its ultimate determination of whether probation should be revoked. We merely require proof by a preponderance of the evidence to establish the \u201c \u2018wholly retrospective factual question\u2019 <em>Gagnon </em>v. <em>Scarpelli, </em>supra, 411 U.S. 784; of whether a condition of probation has been violated. In the second component of revocation proceedings, trial courts will continue to have broad discretion to determine whether the ends of probation are best served by revocation. <em>People </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>supra, 51 Cal. 3d 445 (fair preponderance standard for determination of existence of vio<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>lation is compatible with the broad discretion and flexibility that underlies the ultimate revocation determination).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">As the United States Supreme Court noted with regard to parole (or probation<footnotemark>18</footnotemark>) revocation, the fostering of accurate fact-finding in the initial violation determination should indeed inure to the benefit of the discretionary revocation determination. The discretionary component of revocation proceedings \u201cinvolves the application of expertise by the [decision maker] in making a prediction as to the ability of the individual to live in society without committing antisocial acts. This part of the decision, too, depends on facts, and therefore it is important for the [decision maker] to know not only that some violation was committed but also to know <em>accurately </em>how many and how serious the violations were.\u201d (Emphasis <em>added.) Morrissey </em>v. <em>Brewer, </em>supra, 408 U.S. 480.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">We hold that a trial court may not find a violation of probation unless it finds that the predicate facts underlying the violation have been established by a preponderance of the evidence at the hearing\u2014that is, the evidence must induce a reasonable belief that it is more probable than not that the defendant has violated a condition of his or her probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">In the revocation hearing in this case, the trial court did not indicate what standard of proof it had applied to the evidence, merely stating: \u201cThe court is convinced that it has heard reliable and appropriate evidence to the effect that there has been a violation of the probation condition and so a violation is found.\u201d Ordinarily, in a civil case, we assume that a trial court has applied the fair preponderance of the evidence standard when it has failed to indicate the standard applied. <em>In re Juvenile Appeal (83-AB), </em>189 Conn. 58, 59, 454 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>A.2d 271 (1983). Nevertheless, because the trial court articulated a standard of \u201cappropriate evidence,\u201d we are uncertain as to the standard of proof applied by that court. This is particularly so because of the dicta in our prior decisions referring to the \u201creasonable satisfaction\u201d standard. Therefore, this case should be remanded to the trial court for a determination of whether the state can prove by a fair preponderance of the evidence that the defendant violated a condition of his probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is reversed, and the case is remanded to that court with direction to reverse the judgment of the trial court and to remand the case for a new probation revocation hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b308-12\"> In the present case, \u201cburden of proof\u201d refers to \u201cthe burden of persuading the trier of fact that the alleged fact is true.\u201d 2 C.

Any such warrant shall authorize all officers named therein to return the defendant to the custody of the court or to any suitable detention facility designated by the court. Any probation officer may arrest any defendant on probation without a warrant or may deputize any other officer with power to arrest to do so by giving him a written statement setting forth that the defendant has, in the judgment of the probation officer, violated the conditions of his probation. Such written statement, delivered with the defendant by the arresting officer to the official in charge of any correctional center or other place of detention, shall be sufficient warrant for the detention of the defendant. After making such an arrest, such probation officer shall present to the detaining authorities a similar statement of the circumstances of violation. Provisions regarding release on bail of persons charged with a crime shall be applicable to any defendant arrested under the provisions of this section. Upon such arrest and detention, the probation officer shall immediately so notify the court or any judge thereof. Thereupon, or upon an arrest by warrant as herein provided, the court shall cause the defendant to be brought before it without unnecessary delay for a hearing on the violation charges. At such hearing the defendant shall be informed of the manner in which he is alleged to have violated the conditions of his probation or conditional discharge, shall be advised by the court that he has the right to retain counsel and, if indigent, shall be entitled to the services of the public defender, and shall have the right to cross-examine witnesses and to present evidence in his own behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"AT5\">\u201c(b) If such violation is established, the court may continue or revoke the sentence of probation or conditional discharge or modify or enlarge the conditions, and, if such sentence is revoked, require the defendant to serve the sentence imposed or impose any lesser sentence.
