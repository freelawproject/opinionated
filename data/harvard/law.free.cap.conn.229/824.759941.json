Jacobson, was arrested on September 22, 1991, for operating a motor vehicle while his operator\u2019s license was under suspension in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 14-215 (c).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After a plea of nolo contendere, he was convicted of that charge and sentenced by the trial court to a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment of thirty days and fined $500. Thereafter, he appealed to the Appellate Court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-94a.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>The Appellate Court concluded that the trial court had improperly convicted and sentenced the defendant for a violation of \u00a7 14-215 (c). <em>State </em>v. <em>Jacobson, </em>31 Conn. App. 797, 804, 627 A.2d 474 (1993). It determined, however, that the defendant had committed the lesser included offense of violating \u00a7 14-215 (a) and that he was subject to the penalties provided by \u00a7 14-215 (b),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which are less severe than those provided by \u00a7 14-215 (c). It, therefore, remanded the case to the trial court for sentencing pursuant to \u00a7 14-215 (b). Id., 806.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-6\">We granted certification<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> to consider the issue of whether a defendant, whose motor vehicle operator\u2019s license had been suspended originally because of a violation of General Statutes \u00a7 14-227a (a)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> was subject <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>to the enhanced penalties of \u00a7 14-215 (c) when the period of suspension for violation of \u00a7 14-227a (a) mandated by \u00a7 14-227a (h) (1) (C)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> had expired, but his operator\u2019s license had not been restored because of his failure to furnish the commissioner of motor vehicles with proof of financial responsibility pursuant to \u00a7 14-112.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b849-6\">The Appellate Court, after construing the relevant statutes, concluded that, although the defendant\u2019s operator\u2019s license was under suspension when he was arrested on September 22,1991, it was not under suspension because of his March 28, 1989 conviction of operating under the influence in violation of \u00a7 14-227a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>(a) for which it had been suspended initially. In arriving at its conclusion, the Appellate Court determined that the one year period of suspension mandated by \u00a7 14-227a (h) (1) (C) had expired by the time of the defendant\u2019s arrest for operating under suspension. <em>State </em>v. <em>Jacobson, </em>supra, 31 Conn. App. 799. The court further concluded that, because the period of suspension imposed for the defendant\u2019s violation of \u00a7 14-227a (a) had expired at the time of his arrest in 1991, he was not under suspension at that time \u201con account of a violation of subsection (a) of section 14-227a,\u201d an essential element for a prosecution pursuant to \u00a7 14-215 (c). Id., 804.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-6\">The Appellate Court decided, however, that the defendant\u2019s operator\u2019s license was under suspension at the time of his arrest because he had failed to furnish the commissioner with proof of financial responsibility as required by \u00a7 14-112 when his suspension, because of a violation of \u00a7 14-227a, had terminated. The defendant, the court determined, was therefore in violation of \u00a7 14-215 (a) and, consequently, subject to the penalties of \u00a7 14-215 (b). Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-7\">After considering the briefs and arguments of the parties and examining the record on appeal, we conclude that the judgment of the Appellate Court is correct and must be affirmed. The issue on which we granted certification was properly resolved in the Appellate Court\u2019s thoughtful and thorough unanimous opinion. It would serve no useful purpose for this court to repeat the discussion contained therein.
