The defendant, Wallace Joyce, was charged with two counts of arson in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-lll (a) (3) and (4), respectively.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Prior to trial, he moved to suppress certain evidence, including the results of a chemical analysis of his clothing. Although the trial court granted the motion in part, the court refused to suppress the chemical analysis results. After a jury trial, the defendant was convicted of one count of arson in the first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-lll (a) (4) and acquitted of the charge under \u00a7 53a-lll (a) (3). He was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of twelve years, suspended after four years, fined $5000 and placed on five years probation. On the defendant\u2019s appeal, the Appellate Court affirmed the conviction with one judge, <em>Heiman, J., </em>dissenting. <em>State </em>v. <em>Joyce, </em>30 Conn. App. 164, 619 A.2d 872 (1993). We granted the defendant\u2019s petition for certification.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We conclude that the results of the chemical analysis should have been suppressed and therefore reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">The following evidence and findings, taken from the suppression hearing except as otherwise indicated, are relevant to the defendant\u2019s appeal. On January 29, 1990, fire fighters and paramedics arrived at 125 Maple Street, East Haven, in response to a dispatch call reporting that there had been an explosion at that location. Emergency medical technician Charles Licata, en route to the scene, received a call to step up the priority because there was a patient in need of immediate medical treatment. When Licata arrived, the house at 125 Maple Street was on fire and the defendant was standing in a nearby river, waist deep in water. The defendant appeared to be severely burned. Licata helped the defendant out of the water and up onto an embankment. The defendant\u2019s clothing was burned and smoldering and he had first, second and third degree burns over 42 percent of his body. His hands were degloved, meaning that the skin was intact but it was hanging off his hands. Licata cut all of the defendant\u2019s clothing off in order to expose his injuries so that they could be cleaned and treated and placed the clothing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>on the ground by the side of the road. Licata cleaned the defendant\u2019s bums, placed him on a gurney, covered him with a sterile burn dressing, administered oxygen, and periodically wet down his body with a sterile saline solution. He then took the defendant to Yale-New Haven Hospital. In Licata\u2019s opinion, based on his training and experience with burn victims, the defendant might have died had he not received immediate medical treatment and transportation to the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">Licata and detective Paul Hemingway rode in the ambulance with the defendant to the hospital. Licata told Hemingway that the defendant\u2019s clothing had been left by the roadside. En route to the hospital, Licata asked the defendant what had happened and the defendant responded that he had gone to his parents\u2019 house to check on something. He had opened the door, and there had been an explosion. He was not sure if he had been blown out of the house, or if he had run out of the house to the river.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">In the emergency room, Hemingway also asked the defendant what had happened, and the defendant repeated what he had told Licata. Hemingway then asked the defendant if he had a car. The defendant stated that he had a pickup truck, parked some distance away from the scene of the fire, at the Professional Building on Foxon Road in East Haven. Hemingway asked the defendant why the car was parked elsewhere, and the defendant responded that he had experienced mechanical problems. The conversation lasted only a minute, ending because the defendant, due to his condition, was no longer able to answer questions. Hemingway also spoke with the defendant\u2019s wife. He told her that the police had the defendant\u2019s burned clothing and wallet, and that she could pick them up at the police station.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>Detective Bruce Scobie took possession of the defendant\u2019s clothing, which was lying in a pile on the street. Scobie and Hemingway took the wet items of clothing to the police department, and hung them up to dry. They also inventoried the contents of the defendant\u2019s wallet. After the clothing had dried, it was tagged, placed in bags and stored at the police department. Scobie stated that his intention had been to return the clothing to its proper owner, and that he had been carrying out a customary procedure for safekeeping property, because \u201c[i]f we left . . . [the items of clothing] lying in the street they [would] either be thrown out or stolen.\u201d Both Scobie and Hemingway stated that the defendant had not been considered a suspect at these initial stages of the investigation. The trial court found that the police had taken custody of the defendant\u2019s clothing pursuant to their community caretaking function. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Tully, </em>166 Conn. 126, 136, 348 A.2d 603 (1974). Neither party challenges this finding on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">Within a day, the defendant did become a suspect. On January 30, the day after the fire, Scobie gave the defendant\u2019s clothing to fire marshall Frederick Brow. Brow immediately brought each item of clothing to the state forensic laboratory in Meriden for chemical testing, except for the defendant\u2019s undershirt and dungarees, which he transported two days later. Brow did not obtain a warrant before ordering the chemical analysis of the clothing. The police did, however, apply for and obtain a warrant to seize the defendant\u2019s pickup truck several days later.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-7\">Jack Hubball, the head of the chemistry section of the state forensic laboratory, employed gas chromatography analysis on each of the defendant\u2019s items of clothing. At the defendant\u2019s trial, Hubball testified concerning the nature of the test he had performed. In the first step of the procedure, Hubball heated the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>garments individually to vaporize any organic material present. In the second step of the procedure, he ran the vapors through a column designed to separate the mixture of chemical compounds inside the vapor according to the differing boiling points of each compound. The machine produced a printout of a pattern that represented the compounds present in the vapor. In the final step of the procedure, Hubball compared the pattern with a library of known signature patterns of organic substances. The pattern on the defendant\u2019s shirt, shoes, socks and jeans matched the known pattern for gasoline.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">The defendant argues that the chemical analysis of his clothing was the product of an illegal search and seizure under both the fourth amendment to the United States constitution<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and article first, \u00a7 7, of the constitution of Connecticut<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and therefore should have been suppressed. Since we agree with the defendant that the warrantless chemical analysis of the clothing constituted an unconstitutional search under article first, \u00a7 7, we need not reach the claim under the federal constitution.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u201cIt is well established that federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>constitutional and statutory law establishes a minimum national standard for the exercise of individual rights and does not inhibit state governments from affording higher levels of protection of such rights. . . . <em>Cologne </em>v. <em>Westfarms Associates, </em>192 Conn. 48, 57, 469 A.2d 1201 (1984).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Geisler, </em>222 Conn. 672, 684, 610 A.2d 1225 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">The state argues, however, that we should not review the state constitutional issue because the defendant failed to provide a separate or distinct analysis under the state charter in the Appellate Court. We have made clear that under these circumstances we are not bound to review the state constitutional claim.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>State </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>v. <em>Birch, </em>219 Conn. 743, 746 n.4, 594 A.2d 972 (1991). We have never held, however, that we are precluded from doing so. Under appropriate circumstances, review of state constitutional claims may be undertaken despite the failure of a defendant to brief the state constitutional issue in a prior appeal. <em>State </em>v. <em>Geisler, </em>25 Conn. App. 282, 283-84 n.2, 594 A.2d 985 (1991), aff'd, 222 Conn. 672, 610 A.2d 1225 (1992). In the present case, the dissent in the Appellate Court was predicated in part on the state constitutional issue.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We certified the issue for review under both the federal and state constitutions, and both parties accordingly briefed the state constitutional issue in this court. We conclude that, under the circumstances of this case, we may review the defendant\u2019s article first, \u00a7 7 claim. <em>See State </em>v. <em>Barrett, </em>205 Conn. 437, 445, 534 A.2d 219 (1987).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>In determining whether the results of the chemical test of the defendant\u2019s clothing should have been suppressed under the state exclusionary rule,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> as the product of a search<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> that violated the state constitution, we employ the same analytical framework that would be used under the federal constitution.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>determine (1) whether there was a reasonable expectation of privacy in the clothing, (2) whether the testing of the clothing at the state laboratory constituted a search, and (3) if so, whether the circumstances of this case fall within a recognized exception to the warrant requirement. For purposes of our analysis, we assume that the police had probable cause at the time of the chemical test to believe that the defendant started the fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">We note initially that our determination of the constitutionality of the chemical testing of the defendant\u2019s clothing is not meaningfully assisted by the express language of article first, \u00a7 7, other than the fact that the defendant\u2019s clothing was a \u201cpossession\u201d and therefore falls within the literal reach of the constitutional language. See <em>State </em>v. <em>DeFusco, </em>224 Conn. 627, 635, 620 A.2d 746 (1993). Furthermore, under the circumstances of this case, our determination would not be assisted by a historical analysis of article first, \u00a7 7. \u201c[W]e have, on occasion, employed a historical analysis of state constitutional provisions to aid in our determination of their content; see, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Oquendo, </em>[223 Conn. 635, 650-52, 613 A.2d 1300 (1992)] (\u2018seizure\u2019 under article first, \u00a7\u00a7 7 and 9); <em>State </em>v. <em>Barton, </em>219 Conn. 529, 538 n.4, 594 A.2d 917 (1991) (\u2018probable cause\u2019 under article first, \u00a7 7) . . .\" <em>State </em>v. <em>DeFusco, </em>supra, 635.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">When interpreting the contours of our state charter of liberty, it is clear that we may look to federal prece<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>dent. <em>State </em>v. <em>Geisler, </em>supra, 222 Conn. 685; <em>State </em>v. <em>Lamme, </em>216 Conn. 172, 184, 579 A.2d 484 (1990); see <em>Michigan </em>v. <em>Long, </em>463 U.S. 1032, 1041, 103 S. Ct. 3469, 77 L. Ed. 2d 1201 (1983) (recognizing that in interpreting a state constitution, a state court may \u201crely on federal precedents as it would on the precedents of all other jurisdictions\u201d). We employ this precedent for guidance and analogy when the federal authorities are \u201clogically persuasive and well-reasoned.\u201d W. Brennan, \u201cState Constitutions and the Protection of Individual Rights,\u201d 90 Harv. L. Rev. 489, 502 (1977) (\u201cstate court judges, and also practitioners, do well to scrutinize constitutional decisions by federal courts, for only if they are found to be logically persuasive and well-reasoned, paying due regard to precedent and the policies underlying specific constitutional guarantees, may they properly claim persuasive weight as guideposts when interpreting counterpart state guarantees\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">For the clothing to fall within the protection of article first, \u00a7 7, the defendant must have had a reasonable expectation of privacy. In order to meet this rule of standing; <em>State </em>v. <em>Pittman, </em>209 Conn. 596, 600-601, 553 A.2d 155 (1989); a two-part subjective/objective test must be satisfied: (1) whether the owner or custodian of the clothing \u201cmanifested a subjective expectation of privacy with respect to it\u201d; and (2) whether \u201cthat expectation [is] one that society would consider reasonable. . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>DeFusco, </em>supra, 224 Conn. 633. This determination is made on a case-by-case basis. <em>State </em>v. <em>Reddick, </em>207 Conn. 323, 331, 541 A.2d 1209 (1988). \u201cWhether a defendant\u2019s actual expectation of privacy ... is one that society is prepared to recognize as reasonable involves a fact-specific inquiry into all the relevant circumstances.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Mooney, </em>218 Conn. 85, 94, 588 A.2d 145, cert. denied, 502 U.S. 919, 112 S. Ct. 330, 116 L. Ed. 2d 270 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>Our analysis commences with the concession by the state that generally there is a reasonable expectation of privacy in the clothes that one wears. The state does not claim that mere custody of the defendant\u2019s property would entitle the police to search the property, and the law holds otherwise. <em>State </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>227 Conn. 363, 386-87, 630 A.2d 1315 (1993); <em>State </em>v. <em>Mooney, </em>supra, 218 Conn. 100 (assuming that upon probable cause the police were entitled to seize belongings found under a bridge and preserve them while a proper search warrant was secured, we held that the warrantless search of the belongings violated the fourth amendment). Instead, the state argues that the defendant had no subjective expectation of privacy because his own conduct, in spilling gasoline on his clothing, manifested no intent to preserve a privacy interest in such incriminating evidence. The state cites no authority for this novel proposition. We simply note that article first, \u00a7 7, of the state constitution serves to protect the privacy rights of every citizen, not just those who are intentionally concealing evidence of crimes. Compare <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>Hicks, </em>480 U.S. 321, 324-25, 107 S. Ct. 1149, 94 L. Ed. 2d 347 (1987) (holding that the mere act of moving a piece of stereo equipment to expose its serial number \u2018\u2018produce [d] a[n] . . . invasion of respondent\u2019s privacy\u201d in violation of the fourth amendment without any suggestion that the defendant intentionally concealed the serial number from view). We conclude that the defendant adequately exhibited his subjective expectation of privacy, as he \u201cmerely left his property behind him, more or less of necessity, making no attempt, however, to discard it or disassociate it from himself.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>State </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>v. <em>Philbrick, </em>436 A.2d 844, 855 (Me. 1981), on appeal after remand, 481 A.2d 488 (Me. 1984) (no abandonment found where injured defendant left his knapsack by side of road, hitchhiked to police station, and then told police that pack belonged to him).</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">The state also argues that because the gasoline spill resulted in the emission of a detectable odor, the defendant\u2019s expectation of privacy was objectively unreasonable. The state analogizes the gasoline spill to a coffee stain on clothing that comes within the plain view of the police. The state\u2019s analogy is misplaced. The record contains no evidence that the defendant\u2019s clothing did in fact emit any odor detectable by the human sense of smell.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>The dissent asserts, however, that the defendant\u2019s reasonable expectation of privacy is diminished by the fact that the clothing was damaged by the fire. Although the items of clothing tested at the state laboratory were unusable as clothing and reduced to rags, they were still the defendant\u2019s rags.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Compare <em>State </em>v. <em>Zindros, </em>189 Conn. 228, 238-40, 456 A.2d 288 (1983), cert. denied, 465 U.S. 1012, 104 S. Ct. 1014, 79 L. Ed. 2d 244 (1984) (under fourth amendment of United States constitution, and article first, \u00a7 7, of Connecticut constitution, defendant retained reasonable expectation of privacy in burned out and boarded up building containing damaged personal property). Under all the circumstances of this case, we conclude that the defendant\u2019s expectation of privacy was a reasonable one under article first, \u00a7 7, of the state constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">The next issue to be decided under our state constitution is whether the testing of the clothing at the state laboratory constituted a search. In the first instance, the answer to the question of whether the chemical testing of the clothing constituted a search borders on the obvious. Furthermore, the question has largely been answered by our determination that the defendant had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the invisible and odorless chemicals present in his clothing. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Jacobsen, </em>466 U.S. 109, 122, 104 S. Ct. 1652, 80 L. Ed. 2d 85 (1984) (\u201c[w]e must first determine whether [official conduct] can be considered a 'search\u2019 subject to the Fourth Amendment\u2014did it infringe an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>expectation of privacy that society is prepared to consider reasonable\u201d). Moreover, as previously noted, the testimony of the expert witness Hubball indicates that government conduct invaded the defendant\u2019s reasonable expectation of privacy through the use of a machine designed to detect the presence and identity of many organic compounds by heating clothing items and analyzing the resultant vapors. We conclude that this chemical test, capable of determining a multitude of private facts about an individual,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> constituted a search under article first, \u00a7 7, of the state constitution.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">The state finally claims that if there was a search, it was not unreasonable and therefore passes constitutional muster. Under the state constitution, all warrant-less searches, whether or not the police have probable cause to believe that a crime was committed, are per <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>se unreasonable, unless they fall within one of a few specifically established and well delineated exceptions to the warrant requirement. <em>State </em>v. <em>Blades, </em>225 Conn. 609, 617, 626 A.2d 273 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>supra, 227 Conn. 363, we recently explained the reasoning underlying the warrant requirement. \u201cOur [state] constitutional preference for warrants reflects a goal of protecting citizens from unjustified police intrusions by interposing a neutral decisionmaker between the police and the object of the proposed search. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Diaz, </em>[226 Conn. 514, 628 A.2d 567 (1993)]; cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>162 Conn. 440, 444, 294 A.2d 517, cert. denied, 409 U.S. 870, 93 S. Ct. 198, 34 L. Ed. 2d 121 (1972) (purpose of fourth amendment is to require neutral and detached magistrate to make probable cause determination). Accordingly, a search is invalid if the police, without a justification rooted in a valid exception to the warrant requirement, have relied upon only their own probable cause evaluation, even if later found to be correct, before searching. We thus read the two clauses of article first, \u00a7 7, in conjunction\u2014a warrantless search is per se unreasonable, justified only by limited exceptions\u2014rather than in disjunction\u2014a search is valid if it is reasonable, and the presence of a warrant is just one factor in the determination of reasonableness. Cf., e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Badgett, </em>200 Conn. 412, 423, 512 A.2d 160, cert. denied, 479 U.S. 940, 107 S. Ct. 423, 93 L. Ed. 2d 373 (1986) (construing fourth amendment to bar warrantless searches as per se unreasonable); see generally <em>State </em>v. <em>Larocco, </em>794 P.2d 460, 467-69 (Utah 1990) (extensive discussion of the consequences of reading the two clauses of the fourth amendment in conjunction and in disjunction); R. Bloom, \u2018Warrant Requirement\u2014The Burger Court Approach,\u2019 53 U. Colo. L. Rev. 691 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>\u201cOur constitutional preference for warrants is overcome only in specific and limited circumstances. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Geisler, </em>supra, [222 Conn.] 691 (recognizing emergency exception as matter of state constitutional law); <em>State </em>v. <em>Delossantos, </em>211 Conn. 258, 266-67, 559 A.2d 164, cert. denied, 493 U.S. 866, 110 S. Ct. 188, 107 L. Ed. 2d 142 (1989) (recognizing exception for search incident to arrest as matter of state constitutional law); <em>State </em>v. <em>Dukes, </em>[209 Conn. 98, 126, 547 A.2d 10 (1988)] (recognizing automobile exception on the highway as a matter of state constitutional law). These recognized exceptions derive primarily from acknowledged interests in protecting the safety of the police and the public and in preserving evidence.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>supra, 227 Conn. 382-83.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">In <em>Miller, </em>as in the present case, the police had possession of the defendant\u2019s property\u2014that is, a car that had been towed and impounded following the arrest of the defendant\u2014and the defendant did not challenge the constitutionality of the method by which the police had gained possession of the car. Id., 368. The police searched the impounded car without obtaining a warrant, and found a .357 Smith and Wesson revolver in the trunk. Id. The defendant was subsequently convicted of criminal possession of a weapon upon this evidence. Id. Under our state constitution, we refused to expand the automobile exception<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> to the warrant requirement to include a warrantless search at the police station while the automobile is in lawful custody. We held that \u201c[i]n light of our demonstrated constitutional preference for warrants and our concomitant obligation narrowly to circumscribe exceptions to the state constitutional warrant requirement, we conclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>that a warrantless automobile search supported by probable cause, but conducted after the automobile has been impounded at the police station, violates article first, \u00a7 7, of the Connecticut constitution.\u201d Id., 386-87.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">The circumstances of the search in the present case present an even more compelling case for requiring a warrant than those of <em>State </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>supra, 227 Conn. 363. In <em>Miller, </em>the state argued for the expansion of a recognized exception to the warrant requirement under the state constitution, the automobile exception. In the present case, the state is unable to identify any exception to the warrant requirement that could encompass the warrantless search of the defendant\u2019s clothes.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Our concern for the right to personal privacy and our preference for the warrant to protect that privacy was recently underscored when we pointed out that even if the police act without a warrant under the emergency exception, once that emergency ceases to exist, the police must terminate their intrusive conduct. <em>State </em>v. <em>Geisler, </em>supra, 222 Conn. 695-96.

Our research indicates, however, that there is no decision of the United States Supreme Court, or of any circuit court of the United States, that resolves the critical issue in this case: whether there is a reasonable expectation of privacy in damaged personal property held by the police pursuant to their community caretaking function after being found in a public place. Nevertheless, we need not speculate whether the defendant\u2019s expectation of privacy in the damaged clothing would be reasonable under the fourth amendment, because the defendant invokes the state constitution as well as the federal constitution.

In <em>State </em>v. <em>Barrett, </em>[supra, 205 Conn. 437], our Supreme Court reviewed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>an unpreserved state constitutional claim, raised for the first time on remand from the United States Supreme Court, under the exceptional circumstances doctrine <em>of State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>165 Conn. 61, 327 A.2d 576 (1973), which was later refined by <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 567 A.2d 823 (1989). It would be illogical to afford <em>Evans-Golding </em>review to a defendant, as the one in <em>Barrett, </em>who completely failed to preserve his state constitutional claim at the trial court but to deny review to a defendant, such as the one in this case, who preserved it at trial but failed to set forth a separate argument for it in his initial brief to this court.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b40-7\"> In <em>State </em>v. <em>Dukes, </em>209 Conn. 98, 110, 547 A.2d 10 (1988), we held that article first, \u00a7 7, of the constitution of Connecticut is enforced through an exclusionary rule, overruling prior precedent to the contrary, because the rule had become \u201cwidely recognized as an effective remedy for enforcement of the constitutional protection against unconstitutional searches and seizures.\u201d In doing so, we affirmed the principle that our state constitution is interpreted as a living document. \u201cThe Connecticut constitution is an instrument of progress, it is intended to stand for a great length of time and should not be interpreted too narrowly or too literally so that it fails to have contemporary effectiveness for all of our citizens.\u201d Id., 115.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b40-8\"> Because we find that the chemical analysis of the defendant\u2019s clothing constituted an illegal search under the state constitution, we need not reach the issue of whether its transmittal for chemical analysis, while in the lawful custody of the police under their community care function, constituted a seizure.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b40-9\"> It is important to note that our adoption of an analytical framework or methodology used under the federal constitution does not compel this court to reach the same outcome that a federal court might reach when the methodology is applied to a particular set of factual circumstances. \u201cEven when the state and Federal Constitutions contain the same [or similar] language and employ the same methodology to govern the interpretation and application of that language, the ultimate constitutional decision often will turn upon a factual assessment of how society feels about certain matters or how society functions under various conditions. ...

For example, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Marsala, </em>216 Conn. 150, 151, 579 A.2d 58 (1990), we determined that the good faith exception to the fourth amendment exclusionary rule adopted in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Leon, </em>468 U.S. 897, 104 S. Ct. 3405, 82 L. Ed. 2d 677 (1984), was \u201cincompatible\u201d with the values underlying article first, \u00a7 7, of the constitution of Connecticut. We arrived at this conclusion by undertaking a cost/benefit analysis similar to that employed by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Leon, </em>but reached the opposite conclusion from that court. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Marsala, </em>supra, 167-72; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Leon, </em>supra, 906-23.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b43-6\"> The Appellate Court, after conceding that a person generally has an expectation of privacy in his personal clothing, found that the defendant did not, in part, because he \u201cfailed to exhibit any expectation of privacy in his clothing after the police took it into custody for safekeeping.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Joyce, </em>supra, 30 Conn. App. 172. Although the state does not rely upon this argument in its brief to this court, the dissent does. Therefore, we will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>briefly address it. The defendant\u2019s clothing was removed from him when his skin was falling off as a result of severe burns, and sent to the forensic laboratory while the defendant lay in the hospital near death, only one day after the incident. Under these circumstances, it cannot be said that the defendant failed to exhibit his expectation of privacy by not retrieving his clothing during this twenty-four hour period.</p>\n<p id=\"Ap4\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Mooney, </em>supra, 218 Conn. 94, a case decided under the fourth amendment, a homeless man kept his belongings in a cardboard box and duffel bag under a bridge. He was arrested pursuant to a warrant, and hours later his belongings were seized and searched by police without a search warrant. We found that there was \u201cno element of conduct manifesting a temporary intent to relinquish an expectation of privacy in the contents\u201d of the box and bag and, \u201cof course, no contrary intent can be inferred from the fact that the police arrested him and thus prevented him from returning to his goods and effects that night.\u201d Id., 109.</p>\n<p id=\"Avi\">Similarly, the record in the present case discloses no conduct by the defendant manifesting an intent to relinquish his expectation of privacy in his clothing, and no indication that the police were unaware that his severe burns and hospitalization would explain his failure to go to the police station and claim his clothing within twenty-four hours of the fire. Cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Newman, </em>292 Or. 216, 637 P.2d 143 (1981), cert. denied, 457 U.S. 1111, 102 S. Ct. 2915, 73 L.

We note that although the state\u2019s chemist, Hubball, testified that part of his standard procedure is to take the item to be tested and \u201csmell it a little bit to see if I can smell any accelerants . . . that may be there in a very high level,\u201d he did not testify that he was able to smell any accelerants on the defendant\u2019s clothing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b45-10\"> We take judicial notice that the defendant\u2019s shirt, entered into evidence as an exhibit at the trial, contained a wristwatch, still ticking, when delivered to this court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b46-7\"> That the gas chromatograph utilized by Hubball was capable of exposing rather private facts about an individual is evidenced by Hubball\u2019s testimony before the jury that his machine detected the presence of an organic material in the defendant\u2019s underwear that was not an accelerant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b46-8\"> The state argues that there was no search in the present case, relying on holdings of the United States Supreme Court that certain search methods do not constitute searches under the fourth amendment because they are minimally intrusive and detect only the presence of contraband. <em>United, States </em>v. <em>Jacobsen, </em>supra, 466 U.S. 123 and n.23 (field test of white powder not fourth amendment search because limited to determining the presence or absence of illegal contraband cocaine); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Place, </em>462 U.S. 696, 707, 103 S. Ct. 2637, 77 L. Ed. 2d 110 (1983) (dog sniff for marijuana is \u201csui generis\u201d type of search that offends no legitimate privacy interest because minimally intrusive and detects only presence or absence of contraband). Although we express no opinion on the validity of these holdings under our state constitution, we note that the search methods employed therein are quite distinguishable from that of the present ease. Both of these cases expressly turn on the fact that the tests employed detect only the presence of contraband narcotics, and the possession of narcotics is not a \u201cprivate fact\u201d under the fourth amendment. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Jacobsen, </em>supra, 123; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Place, </em>supra, 707. As discussed above, however, the gas chromatograph test is not designed to detect the presence of contraband, and in fact detects the presence and identity of many organic substances.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b48-7\"> In <em>Chambers </em>v. <em>Maroney, </em>399 U.S. 42, 51, 90 S. Ct. 1975, 26 L.

Although the state argues on appeal that the evaporative properties of gasoline present exigent circumstances for a warrant-less search, the state did not make this argument before the trial court, and consequently no testimony was presented with regard to whether the evidence was so evanescent as to constitute exigent circumstances. This court does not find facts. <em>State </em>v. <em>Reagan, </em>209 Conn. 1, 8, 546 A.2d 839 (1988), on remand, 18 Conn. App. 32, 556 A.2d 183, cert. denied, 211 Conn. 805, 559 A.2d 1139 (1989). We therefore decline to consider this argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b50-7\">Callahan, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AIJ\">with whom Santaniello, J., joins, dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-8\">I dissent from the majority opinion because I do not believe that the defendant had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the burnt remnants of his clothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-9\">In order to claim the protection of the fourth amendment prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures, a defendant must establish that he or she had a legitimate expectation of privacy in the invaded property. <em>State </em>v. <em>Mooney, </em>218 Conn. 85, 94, 588 A.2d 145, cert. denied, 502 U.S. 919, 112 S. Ct. 330, 116 L. Ed. 2d 270 (1991). \u201cAbsent such an expectation, the subsequent police action has no constitutional ramifications.\u201d Id., citing State v. <em>Brown, </em>198 Conn. 348, 355, 503 A.2d 566 (1986). In order to determine whether a defendant harbored such an expectation, we inquire into (1) whether the individual manifested a subjective expectation of privacy, and (2) whether that expectation was one that society would consider reasonable. <em>State </em>v. <em>DeFusco, </em>224 Conn. 627, 633, 620 A.2d 746 (1993), citing <em>Katz </em>v. <em>United States, </em>389 U.S. 347, 361, 88 S. Ct. 507, 19 L. Ed. 2d 576 (1967) (Harlan, J., concurring). The determination of whether the defendant has established a reasonable expectation of privacy must be made on a case-by-case basis; <em>State </em>v. <em>Mooney, </em>supra, 94; and by undertaking a factual inquiry into all of the relevant circumstances. <em>State </em>v. <em>Reddick, </em>207 Conn. 323, 331, 541 A.2d 1209 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b50-10\">In the present case, when the fire fighters arrived on the scene of the fire, the defendant was standing in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>river with severe burns over most of the front of his body. The defendant\u2019s clothes were cut off in order to allow treatment of his burns. <em>State </em>v. <em>Joyce, </em>30 Conn. App. 164, 166, 619 A.2d 872 (1993). \u00c1 fire fighter described the defendant\u2019s clothing as charred and \u201c \u2018mostly burned off his body in all the areas where he had the third and second degree burns.\u2019 \u201d Id. The burned clothing was deposited in a wet pile alongside a public road. Id., 166-67. The defendant concedes that the police could properly have made a decision, as they did, to take his burned clothing to the police station as part of their community caretaking function. Id., 169. Nothing in the record indicates that the defendant articulated or otherwise manifested any subjective expectation of privacy in the remnants of his clothing. Moreover, even if the defendant had somehow manifested a subjective expectation of privacy, I believe that such an expectation is one that society would not recognize as reasonable. The defendant contends, nevertheless, that an unreasonable search occurred when the police transferred the clothes from police headquarters to the forensic laboratory to be tested for traces of gasoline.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">At the outset, any expectation of privacy that the defendant may have had in his clothing was diminished by virtue of their condition and their treatment. The trial court opined that the remnants were no longer usable as clothing. <em>State </em>v. <em>Joyce, </em>supra, 30 Conn. App. 167 n.6. While a reasonable expectation of privacy may attach to one\u2019s clothing, that expectation necessarily diminishes when the clothing is reduced to burnt remnants placed by the roadside.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">The majority relies on <em>State </em>v. <em>Zindros, </em>189 Conn. 228, 240, 456 A.2d 288 (1983), cert. denied, 465 U.S. 1012, 104 S. Ct. 1014, 79 L. Ed. 2d 244 (1984), for the proposition that a person\u2019s expectation of privacy in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>property does not disappear merely because the property is damaged. I agree.. The present case, however, is distinguishable from <em>Zindros.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">In <em>Zindros, </em>we concluded that the defendant had a reasonable expectation of privacy in a \u201cburned out and boarded up building.\u201d Id. That conclusion was based on evidence that the defendant \u201calways secured the site upon leaving\u201d because he stored merchandise there worth approximately $6750. Id. Thus, the defendant\u2019s subjective expectation of privacy, evidenced by his securing the building every time he left, was reasonable because the building was still able to be closed up and was being used as a depository for his personal property. In the present case, the defendant\u2019s clothing was no longer usable as such and the defendant neither expressed nor exhibited any interest in the remnants until the test results were to be introduced into evidence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Any reasonable expectation of privacy that might attach to clothing in general was severely diminished as a result.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">Furthermore, \u201can inadvertent leaving of effects in a public place, whether or not an abandonment in the true sense of the word, can amount to a loss of any justified expectation of privacy.\u201d W. LaFave, Search &amp; Seizure (Sup. 1994) \u00a7 2.6, p. 94; see <em>Wagner v. </em>Hedrick, 181 W. Va. 482, 383 S.E.2d 286 (1989) (no reasonable expectation of privacy in personal effects removed by hospital personnel and left in hospital emergency room freely accessible to law enforcement officers, medical personnel and public in general); <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>District Court of New Hampshire, </em>384 Mass. 736, 742, 429 N.E.2d 335 (1981) (no reasonable expectation of privacy in jacket inadvertently left in common area of hospi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>tal). In the present case, the remnants of the defendant\u2019s clothing were left on the side of the road, readily accessible to the public and law enforcement personnel.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-4\">Nor did the defendant retain an expectation of privacy in his burnt clothing merely because a police officer, rather than a passerby, happened to retrieve the remnants from the roadside. We have refused to recognize that one\u2019s expectation of privacy depends upon who comes into possession of the property in question. \u201cA person either has an objectively reasonable expectation of privacy or does not; what is objectively reasonable cannot, logically, depend on the source of the intrusion on his or her privacy.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>DeFusco, </em>supra, 224 Conn. 638-39. Finally, an expectation of privacy does not attach to property merely because it may constitute incriminating evidence. See <em>Rakas </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>439 U.S. 128, 143 n.12, 58 L. Ed. 2d 387, 99 S. Ct. 421 (1978), reh. denied, 439 U.S. 1122, 99 S. Ct. 1035, 59 L. Ed. 2d 83 (1979) (noting that while a defendant may have a subjective expectation of privacy in incriminating evidence, that expectation is not one society is prepared to recognize as reasonable).</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b52-8\"> It appears that the defendant\u2019s wallet, on the other hand, which was also picked up from the roadside by the police, was retrieved by the defendant's wife the day after the incident.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
