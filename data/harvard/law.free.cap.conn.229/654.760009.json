Therefore, we affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court, although we do so on different grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">The following facts are undisputed. In April, 1985, the named plaintiff, Vincent McManus, contacted the state department of environmental protection (department) concerning the excavation of a farm pond in a wetland located on property owned by his wife, the plaintiff Patricia McManus. An environmental analyst from the department made a preliminary on-site deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>mination that the proposed farm pond was not likely to have a significant adverse impact on the wetland and therefore was \u201cno big deal.\u201d In September, 1985, the department informed the plaintiffs that the farm pond could be excavated without a permit pursuant to the exemption provided under General Statutes \u00a7 22a-40 (a) (1),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> but that the creation of a \u201cpasture or other fast land in wetlands adjacent to the pond [was] not exempt.\u201d Thereafter, the plaintiffs filed, but subsequently withdrew, an application for a permit to excavate a farm pond and deposit the excavated material on the surrounding area.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-4\">In the spring of 1987, the plaintiffs excavated a farm pond on their property and deposited the removed material on the surrounding wetlands. On May 4,1987, the defendant filed a civil action pursuant to \u00a7 22a-44 (b) against Patricia McManus seeking the removal of the fill from the wetlands adjacent to the farm pond, the restoration of the wetlands to their prior condition, and the payment of a civil penalty and various costs. Pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 22a-42,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> on July 1, 1988, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>the department transferred jurisdiction over the inland wetlands and watercourses of the town of Wallingford to the newly created Wallingford inland wetlands commission (commission). The department, however, informed the commission that it was retaining jurisdiction over enforcement activities that were already underway.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">On March 6,1990, the defendant issued an administrative order to both plaintiffs directing removal of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>fill and restoration of the wetlands. Two days later, after almost three years of extensive pleadings, motions and depositions, the defendant withdrew the civil action against Patricia McManus, leaving the administrative order in place. The plaintiffs appealed from the administrative order pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 22a-6 (e). After a hearing, an administrative hearing officer from the department issued a \u201cFinal Decision and Order\u201d upholding the administrative order. Pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 22a-43 (a),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the plaintiffs appealed to the trial court, which upheld the decision of the department\u2019s administrative hearing officer. The plaintiffs then appealed to the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">The Appellate Court concluded that \u00a7 22a-44 prohibited the defendant from issuing an administrative order pursuant to subsection (a) after having initiated a civil action pursuant to subsection (b). <em>McManus </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Environmental Protection, </em>31 Conn. App. 105, 623 A.2d 1041 (1993). The Appellate Court therefore reversed the judgment of the trial court and remanded the case with direction to sustain the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal. We granted the defendant\u2019s petition for certification to appeal<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and now affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court on different grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>The defendant argues that the Appellate Court\u2019s decision should be reversed. The defendant reasons that because subsections (a) and (b) of \u00a7 22a-44 provide independent, alternative remedies, the initiation of a civil action does not bar the subsequent issuance of an administrative order. We need not address this issue, however, because we conclude that even if the initiation of a civil action does not bar the subsequent issuance of an administrative order, the defendant did not have jurisdiction to issue the March, 1990 order.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">In 1987, the legislature amended the Inland Wetlands and Watercourses Act (act); General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 22a-36 through 22a-45; \u201cto require municipal regulation of activities affecting the wetlands and watercourses within the territorial limits of the various municipalities or districts.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 22a-42 (a); see Public Acts 1987, No. 87-533, \u00a7\u00a7 5, 14. Each municipality was required to \u201cestablish an inland wetlands agency or authorize an existing board or commission to carry out the provisions of\u201d the act. General Statutes \u00a7 22a-42 (c). We held in <em>Samperi </em>v. <em>Inland Wetlands Agency, </em>226 Conn. 579, 591-92, 628 A.2d 1286 (1993), that, pursuant to the amendments, \u201c[t]he local inland wetlands agency was given the <em>sole authority </em>to license and regulate wetland activities .... The legislature, in effect . . . placed the initial and principal responsibility for striking the balance between economic activities and preservation of wetlands in the hands of the local authorities.\u201d (Emphasis added.) As previously noted, on July 1, 1988, the department transferred jurisdiction over local inland wetlands matters to the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">Before both the department\u2019s administrative hearing officer and the trial court, the plaintiffs claimed that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>the defendant could not properly issue the March 6, 1990 administrative order because jurisdiction had been transferred to the commission.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Both the department\u2019s administrative hearing officer and the trial court rejected this claim, on the basis of: (1) \u00a7 22a-42 (f), which provides that \u201cthe commissioner shall retain authority to act on any application filed with said commissioner prior to the establishment or designation of an inland wetlands agency by a municipality\u201d; and (2) the fact that the letter sent by the department to the commission transferring jurisdiction explicitly retained jurisdiction over \u201cenforcement activities currently underway.\u201d Both the department\u2019s hearing officer and the trial court construed \u00a7 22a-42 (f) to apply to enforcement activities as well as permit applications. In addition, both concluded that, because the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>ant had filed the civil action in 1987, there had been an enforcement activity underway when jurisdiction was transferred in 1988, and therefore the defendant had retained jurisdiction over the plaintiffs\u2019 alleged violation and could properly have issued the March 6,1990 order. We disagree.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">We assume, for purposes of this appeal, that \u00a7 22a-42 (f) applies to enforcement activities as well as permit applications, and that it authorized the defendant to maintain the \u00a7 22a-44 (b) civil action against Patricia McManus after jurisdiction over wetlands matters had been transferred to the commission. Notwithstanding this assumption, subsections (a) and (b) of \u00a7 22a-44 provide independent, alternative remedies that are procedurally distinct. <em>Conservation Commission </em>v. <em>Price, </em>193 Conn. 414, 421, 479 A.2d 187 (1984). A civil action pursuant to subsection (b) proceeds like any other judicial action, with the trial court acting as fact finder and decision maker. In contrast, if the defendant issues an administrative order pursuant to subsection (a), the aggrieved party\u2019s recourse is a hearing before an administrative hearing officer of the department who acts as both fact finder and decision maker.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> While a further appeal to the trial court is allowed, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>court acts as an appellate court and must defer to the agency\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Furthermore, although to enforce the order it may be necessary for the defendant to initiate a civil action after an administrative order is issued, the converse is not true. An administrative order is not needed to enforce a civil judgment and cannot provide a greater remedy. Therefore, by issuing the administrative order three years after commencing the civil action, and then withdrawing the civil action, the defendant did not merely pursue an enforcement activity to its logical conclusion. Rather, the defendant abandoned the enforcement activity that had been underway and commenced a different enforcement vehicle in a different forum.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">We do not believe that, in enacting \u00a7 22a-42 (f), the legislature intended to authorize the defendant to abandon a civil action pursuant to \u00a7 22a-44 (b) and initiate administrative proceedings against the plaintiffs almost two years after jurisdiction had been transferred to the commission. We recognize that environmental statutes are remedial in nature and should be construed liberally to accomplish their purposes. <em>Starr </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Environmental Protection, </em>226 Conn. 358, 382, 627 A.2d 1296 (1993). We note, however, that the broad construction given to \u00a7 22a-42 (f) by the department and the trial court is unnecessary to accomplish the purposes of the act, because the defendant could have enforced the act fully through the \u00a7 22a-44 (b) civil action. We therefore decline to construe the statute to authorize the issuance of an administrative order against the plaintiffs almost two years after jurisdiction had been transferred to the municipality.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-8\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b677-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 22a-44 provides in part: \u201c(a) If the inland wetlands agency or its duly authorized agent finds that any person is conducting or maintaining any activity, facility or condition which is in violation of sections 22a-36 to 22a-45, inclusive, or of the regulations of the inland wetlands agency, the agency or its duly authorized agent may issue a written order by certified mail, to such person conducting such activity or maintaining such facility or condition to cease immediately such activity or to correct such facility or condition. Within ten days of the issuance of such order the agency shall hold a hearing to provide the person an opportunity to be heard and show cause why <em>the order </em>should not remain in effect. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>agency shall consider the facts presented at the hearing and within ten days of the completion of the hearing notify the person by certified mail that the original order remains in effect, that a revised order is in effect, or that the order has been withdrawn. The original order shall be effective upon issuance and shall remain in effect until the agency affirms, revises or withdraws the order. The issuance of an order pursuant to this section shall not delay or bar an action pursuant to subsection (b) of this section. The commissioner may issue orders pursuant to sections 22a-6 to 22a-7, inclusive, concerning an activity, facility or condition which is in violation of said sections 22a-36 to 22a-45, inclusive, if the municipality in which such activity, facility or condition is located has failed to enforce its inland wetlands regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"AX4\">\u201c(b) Any person who commits, takes part in, or assists in any violation of any provision of sections 22a-36 to 22a-45, inclusive, including regulations adopted by the commissioner and ordinances and regulations promulgated by municipalities or districts pursuant to the grant of authority herein contained, shall be assessed a civil penalty of not more than one thousand dollars for each offense. Each violation of said sections shall be a separate and distinct offense, and, in the case of a continuing violation, each day\u2019s continuance thereof shall be deemed to be a separate and distinct offense. The superior court, in an action brought by the commissioner, municipality, district or any person, shall have jurisdiction to restrain a continuing violation of said sections, to issue orders directing that the violation be corrected or removed and to assess civil penalties pursuant to this section. All costs, fees and expenses in connection with such action shall be assessed as damages against the violator together with reasonable attorney\u2019s fees which may be allowed, all of which shall be awarded to the commissioner, municipality, district or person which brought such action. The moneys collected pursuant to this section shall be used by the commissioner of environmental protection, to restore the affected wetlands or watercourses to their condition prior to the violation, wherever possible.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b679-5\"> General Statutes \u00a7 22a-40 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cThe following operations and uses shall be permitted in wetlands and watercourses, as of right:</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">\u201c(1) Grazing, farming, nurseries, gardening and harvesting of crops and farm ponds of three acres or less . . .</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b679-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 22a-42 provides: \u201c(a) To carry out and effectuate the purposes and policies of sections 22a-36 to 22a-45, inclusive, it is hereby declared to be the public policy of the state to require municipal regulation of activities affecting the wetlands and watercourses within the territorial limits of the various municipalities or districts.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-8\">\u201c(b) Any municipality may acquire wetlands and watercourses within its territorial limits by gift or purchase, in fee or lesser interest including, but not limited to, lease, easement or covenant, subject to such reservations and exceptions as it deems advisable.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-9\">\u201c(c) On or before July 1,1988, each municipality shall establish an inland wetlands agency or authorize an existing board or commission to carry out the provisions of sections 22a-36 to 22a-45, inclusive.

Nevertheless, this court may consider claims that fall within the scope of the certified question. <em>Rozbicki </em>v. <em>Huybrechts, </em>218 Conn. 386, 389, 589 A.2d 363 (1991); see footnote 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">Moreover, it is the defendant\u2019s own brief that has prompted our consideration of jurisdiction. Footnote 9 of the defendant\u2019s brief states that \u201cwhen this enforcement action began, Wallingford did not have a municipal inland wetlands agency and jurisdiction rested with the Commissioner. When jurisdiction was transferred to the Wallingford Inland Wetlands Commission on July 1, 1988, the Department of Environmental Protection retained authority over ongoing enforcement activities, of which this case was one. . . . When [the administrative order] was issued on March 6, 1990, it was issued by the Commissioner because it related to wetlands violations initiated prior to the existence of the Wallingford wetlands agency.\u201d This footnote suggests that the defendant\u2019s jurisdiction to issue the administrative order was predicated on the fact that the civil action had been initiated prior to July 1,1988. Predicating jurisdiction to issue the administrative order on the existence of the civil action appears to be inconsistent with the defendant\u2019s other claims that subsections (a) and (b) of \u00a7 22a-44 provide independent, alternative methods of enforcing the act, and that dismissing a civil action without prejudice \u201cleaves the parties free to litigate the matter in a subsequent action, <em>as though the dismissed action had not been commenced. \u201d </em>(Emphasis in original.) These factors have led us to decide as a threshold question whether the defendant had jurisdiction in March, 1990, to issue the order.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b684-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 22a-44 (a) provides in part that the \u201ccommissioner may issue orders . . . concerning an activity, facility or condition which is in violation of said sections 22a-36 to 22a-45, inclusive, if the municipality in which such activity, facility or condition is located has failed to enforce its inland wetlands regulations.\u201d The defendant does not claim, however, that Wallingford has failed to enforce its regulations.
