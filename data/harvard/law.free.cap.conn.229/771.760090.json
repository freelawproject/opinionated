This appeal is the culmination of a business dispute between two brothers, the plaintiff, Raymond Rosenfield, and the defendant Norman Rosenfield.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The dispute involved two close corporations, the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>ants Metals Selling Corporation (Metals Selling) and Metalmast Marine, Inc. (Metalmast), owned and managed by the Rosenfields. Norman appeals and Raymond cross appeals from the judgment of the trial court. That judgment rejected in part the findings of a court-appointed auditor favorable to Norman and adverse to Raymond.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">On his appeal, Norman challenges: (1) the standard of review employed by the trial court in connection with its review of the auditor\u2019s findings; and (2) the court\u2019s finding that Norman was not entitled to reimbursement for certain posttrial attorney\u2019s fees and rental payments. On his cross appeal, Raymond challenges the trial court\u2019s conclusions that: (1) Norman\u2019s management of Metals Selling, during the period when it was under his sole control and when its assets were substantially depleted, was protected by the business judgment rule and was not a breach of the duty of care owed by Norman to the shareholders of Metals Selling; (2) payment of the legal fees of Schatz &amp; Schatz, Ribicoff &amp; Kotkin (law firm) by the two defendant corporations for representation of both the defendant corporations and Norman in this litigation was proper; (3) salary increases and bonuses paid to Norman\u2019s son, Paul Rosenfield, an employee of Metalmast, and rental payments made by Metals Selling to Norman, were not voidable self-dealing transactions; and (4) the assessment of the costs of the appraisal proceedings against Norman was not required pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 33-384. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-8\">The record discloses the following facts. In 1938, Raymond settled in Putnam and began a career in busi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>ness. He was joined thereafter by his younger brother Norman, with whom he founded Metals Selling on the western bank of the Quinebaug River.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Metals Selling processed various metals and was primarily engaged in the business of grinding magnesium under contract. Subsequent to founding Metals Selling, Raymond and Norman diversified their line of business in 1958 by forming Metalmast, a manufacturer of aluminum masts and sailboats. Throughout the existence of the two corporations, either Raymond and Norman individually, or their respective immediate families, each owned 50 percent of the voting capital stock of Metals Selling and Metalmast. From the time of incorporation of Metals Selling and Metalmast, Raymond and Norman were officers and directors of both companies. From the 1940s through the beginning of the 1980s, the two brothers worked together in the two companies running them by \u201cconsensus and agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">Although both brothers were equal owners of the two companies, from the 1940s through some time in the 1970s, Raymond exercised more authority in the businesses than did Norman. Norman\u2019s and Raymond\u2019s children became employees of the two companies. Norman\u2019s son, Paul Rosenfield, was employed by Metalmast. Raymond\u2019s children, Charles Rosenfield and Katherine Rosenfield, were employees of Metals Selling.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">During 1984, after Raymond had partially retired, relations between Raymond and Norman, and between their respective families, deteriorated markedly. Raymond\u2019s children were not able to work with Norman as their superior. Raymond proposed solutions to these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>problems to which Norman did not agree. Raymond then suggested that the brothers\u2019 business interests be separated. Norman first ignored the suggestions and then refused. At this time, Raymond significantly diminished his working hours, so that by early 1985, he had no involvement with the companies\u2019 activities. Thereafter, Metalmast and Metals Selling were controlled by Norman.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">By 1986, Raymond insisted on the separation of the business interests of the two brothers. Norman resisted. Subsequently, in 1988, Raymond commenced these four actions. Two actions sought dissolution of Metals Selling and Metalmast pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 33-382 (a).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The other two actions were derivative suits seeking, on behalf of the companies, damages from Norman.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">Prior to answers being filed by the defendants in these actions, Norman and Raymond entered into an agreement (stipulation) in an effort to narrow the issues dividing them and to settle the dispute. Pursuant to the stipulation, Norman and Raymond agreed to the appointment of an auditor, who was charged with the valuation of Metals Selling and Metalmast and other<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>wise resolving all claims between the two brothers arising out of their working and corporate relationship over the previous forty years.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The stipulation established a procedure for the submission of evidence to the auditor, and provided that the auditor\u2019s report was to be filed with the trial court. The stipulation provided further that the auditor\u2019s report was subject to protest by either brother at a hearing before the trial court, and that the brothers could conduct discovery prior to that hearing, call witnesses, and subject witnesses to cross-examination. The stipulation stated that the trial court was under \u201cno obligation to either accept or reject\u201d the auditor\u2019s report. The stipulation did not, however, refer to chapter 15 of the Practice Book,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> or specify the standard of review to be applied by the trial court to the auditor\u2019s report.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>Both brothers submitted claims to the auditor. The claims ranged from the significant<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> to the petty.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In total, Raymond submitted forty-three pages of claims against Norman, and Norman submitted nine pages of claims against Raymond.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\">The auditor\u2019s report rejected substantially all of Raymond\u2019s claims against Norman and accepted substantially all of Norman\u2019s claims against Raymond. Pursuant to the stipulation, an evidentiary hearing was held on the auditor\u2019s report in the trial court.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> After determining that no special deference was to be accorded to the findings of the auditor, the trial court rejected the auditor\u2019s findings in favor of Norman\u2019s claims against Raymond, and accepted the auditor\u2019s findings rejecting Raymond\u2019s claims against Norman. In short, the trial court did not disturb the allocation of assets <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>existing between Raymond and Norman at the beginning of the dispute. This appeal and cross appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">The Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"AdK\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b801-7\">On appeal, Norman first claims that the trial court improperly accorded an incorrect standard of review to the findings of the auditor. He argues that the language of the stipulation mandated deference by the trial court to the findings of the auditor, because the auditor\u2019s report was subject to the provisions of chapter 15 of the Practice Book, and that the trial court improperly failed to accord the findings in the auditor\u2019s report the appropriate deference. This claim is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-8\">The standard of review to be accorded the auditor\u2019s finding was not specified in the stipulation. The stipulation did not refer to chapter 15 of the Practice Book. See footnote 6. None of the applicable procedures specified in the Practice Book for creating a reference were followed either in the stipulation or in the auditor\u2019s report. Those procedures include the closing of pleadings and the filing of a claims list pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 433.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In addition, under Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 435 through 440, parties seeking to challenge the report of an auditor appointed pursuant to such a reference are afforded very limited rights. These rights do not include the right to conduct discovery after the report has been filed with the trial court, the right to an evidentiary hearing, or the right to cross-examine witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>The language of the stipulation provided for the appointment of an auditor, whose report when presented to the trial court would be \u201csubject to protest by either Norman or Raymond.\u201d The stipulation further provided that \u201c[t]he court [was] under no obligation to accept or reject the auditor\u2019s report,\u201d and that there would be an evidentiary hearing on the auditor\u2019s report that would be subject to procedural due process. The stipulation further afforded both brothers the right to conduct discovery and cross-examine witnesses in connection with the evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">Absent a clearly expressed intention of the parties, the construction of a stipulation is a question of fact committed to the sound discretion of the trial court. See <em>Central Connecticut Teachers Federal Credit Union </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>27 Conn. App. 435, 437, 606 A.2d 729 (1992). A \u201cstipulation . . . must be construed according to the intention of the parties as expressed in the language used in the document itself . . . <em>.\u201d Foley v. Foley, </em>149 Conn. 469, 471, 181 A.2d 607 (1962). Unless the language is so clear as to render its interpretation a matter of law, the question of the parties\u2019 intent in entering into a stipulation is a question of fact that is subject to the \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d scope of review. <em>Thompson &amp; Peck, Inc. </em>v. <em>Harbor Marine Contracting Corp., </em>203 Conn. 123, 130, 523 A.2d 1266 (1987). The trial court determined that the parties did not intend by the stipulation to create a reference under chapter 15 of the Practice Book, or to have the trial court give the conclusions of the auditor any particular weight. These factual determinations are supported by a fair reading of the stipulation, and are not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b802-7\">Norman next claims that the trial court improperly rejected his posttrial motion for certain attorney\u2019s fees. He argues that the trial court improperly concluded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>that the stipulation did not provide for payment of his legal fees to the law firm. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">The stipulation provided that the judgment of the trial court was to be res judicata, subject to rights of appeal, as to <em>all </em>claims that any party had against another. The trial court determined that Norman had failed to submit any claims for attorney\u2019s fees to the auditor or to the trial court. It concluded, therefore, that he was precluded from raising these claims post-trial. In addition, the only relevant facts in the record indicate that the legal fees of the law firm through May 21,1991, in this matter were paid by Metals Selling and Metalmast, not by Norman.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">The interpretation of the stipulation was within the discretion of the trial court. See <em>Central Connecticut Teachers Federal Credit Union </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>supra, 27 Conn. App. 437; <em>Niles </em>v. <em>Niles, </em>9 Conn. App. 240, 245, 518 A.2d 932 (1986). Because the facts in the record provided a sufficient basis for the trial court\u2019s reading of the stipulation regarding this claim, we decline to disturb that determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-7\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b803-8\">Norman\u2019s final claim is that the trial court improperly rejected his claim for a retroactive increase in certain rental payments from Metals Selling and Metalmast to him. He argues that the trial court\u2019s determination that the fair market rental value of his property was $10,000 per month necessitated a conclusion that the corporations, which were paying an aggregate rental of $9000 per month for the premises, were in arrearage. He argues that the trial court\u2019s rejection of his posttrial claim, in light of its earlier determination, was improper. This claim is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-9\">The following facts are relevant to this claim. Norman and Raymond had been joint owners of property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>on which Metalmast and Metals Selling conducted a substantial portion of their operations. Subsequent to the breakdown of harmonious relations between Raymond and Norman, this property was the subject of a blind auction between the two brothers. In the auction, Raymond\u2019s marker was drawn and he elected to sell his one-half interest in the property to Norman for the price that had been specified by Norman.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> As noted above, Metalmast and Metals Selling were tenants on the property. After acquiring Raymond\u2019s interest in the property, Norman directed Metals Selling to pay him the $5000 per month in rent that it had been previously paying to Metalmast as a subtenant on the property. The trial court concluded that the fair market rent for the property was $10,000 per month.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">The trial court\u2019s determination of the fair market rental for the property in question was made in response to a claim by Raymond that the rental payments by the corporations to Norman constituted voidable self-dealing. Norman did not make any claim to the auditor that the rental payments he was receiving were insufficient. Indeed, it would have been within his power to increase the rental payments he received from the corporations during the time he was in sole control of them had he believed the rental payments to be insufficient. A finding that the fair market rental proceeds from a particular property exceed the actual rent charged by the landlord does not automatically establish an entitlement for a judicially mandated retroactive increase in rental payments. Norman offers no authority for his claim, nor can we conceive of any.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b805-4\">The Cross Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"Akvd\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">On his cross appeal, Raymond first claims that the trial court incorrectly determined that Norman\u2019s management of Metals Selling, during the period it was under his sole control and its assets were substantially depleted, was protected by the business judgment rule and did not constitute a violation of the duty of care owed by Norman to the shareholders of Metals Selling. He argues that the trial court\u2019s determination that Norman\u2019s conduct was not so egregious as to constitute fraud or gross mismanagement was an improper application of the business judgment rule. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">The following additional facts are relevant to this claim. After Raymond\u2019s retirement from the management of the companies in 1985, he did not participate in the management of either company. Raymond\u2019s son, Charles, left Metals Selling in 1985, and Raymond\u2019s daughter, Katherine, left Metals Selling in 1987. Thereafter, Metals Selling ceased to grind magnesium. All activities at Metals Selling, other than the redevelopment of a hydroelectric facility on the Quinebaug River known as the upper power site,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> essentially ceased. Unsurprisingly, during this time period, there was a substantial diminution in the operating income of Metals Selling. During the period from 1988 to 1991, the operating income of Metals Selling was approxi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>mately $50,000. Expenditures during the same period were over $1,000,000.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> These expenditures were principally incurred in connection with the redevelopment of the upper power site. Raymond disagreed with the specifics of the plan to redevelop the upper power site and objected to the expenditure of large sums of money by Metals Selling while he was attempting to separate his ownership interests from Norman\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">The trial court determined that Norman had exercised supervision of Metals Selling during this period in a manner consistent with due care. In so concluding, the trial court found that Norman had retained experts in connection with the development by Metals Selling of the upper power site, that those experts had recommended a smaller project than had been contemplated by Raymond, and that Norman reasonably accepted that recommendation. Additionally, the trial court determined that development of the upper power site proceeded at a pace that was consistent with the pace achieved during Raymond\u2019s involvement in the management of Metals Selling, and that the project was completed within budget. The trial court concluded that Norman\u2019s actions during this period were protected from challenge under the business judgment rule, and were thus immunized from liability. The trial court further determined that Raymond had failed to demonstrate that Norman\u2019s conduct during the applicable period was so egregious as to constitute fraud or gross mismanagement inconsistent with normal business practices for similarly situated closely held corporations.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-6\">This is the first occasion that this court has had to determine the scope of the business judgment rule in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>Connecticut. Originating at common law, the rule has previously been construed under Connecticut law by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals; see <em>Joy </em>v. <em>North, </em>692 F.2d 880, 884-86 (2d Cir. 1982), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Citytrust </em>v. <em>Joy, </em>460 U.S. 1051, 103 S. Ct. 1498, 75 L. Ed. 2d 930 (1983); and has been codified in part in General Statutes \u00a7 33-313.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The business judgment rule insulates corporate directors<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> from liability for business decisions within the power of the corporation for which the directors have exercised due care.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> H. Henn, Law of Corporations (2d Ed. 1970) \u00a7 242, p. 482.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>\u201c[T]he business judgment doctrine [is] a rule of law that insulates business decisions from most forms of review. Courts recognize that managers have both better information and better incentives than they. The press of market forces . . . will more effectively serve the interests of all participants than will an error-prone judicial process.\u201d <em>Kumpf </em>v. <em>Steinhaus, </em>779 F.2d 1323, 1325 (7th Cir. 1985), citing <em>Joy </em>v. <em>North, </em>supra, 692 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>F.2d 885-87. The business judgment rule \u201cexpresses a sensible policy of judicial noninterference with business decisions made in circumstances free from serious conflicts of interest between management, which makes the decisions, and the corporation\u2019s shareholders. Not only do businessmen know more about business than judges do, but competition in the product and labor markets and in the market for corporate control<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> provides sufficient punishment for businessmen who commit more than their share of business mistakes.\u201d <em>Dynamics Corp. of America </em>v. <em>CTS Corp., </em>794 F.2d 250, 256 (7th Cir. 1986). \u201c[T]he fact is that liability is rarely imposed upon corporate directors or officers simply for bad judgment and this reluctance to impose liability for unsuccessful business decisions has been doctrinaily labeled the business judgment rule.\u201d <em>Joy </em>v. <em>North, </em>supra, 885. Shareholders challenging the wisdom of a business decision taken by management must overcome the business judgment rule.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> <em>Kum/pf </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>v. <em>Steinhaus, </em>supra, 1325. \u201cFor efficiency reasons, corporate decision makers should be permitted to act decisively and with relative freedom from a judge\u2019s or jury\u2019s subsequent second questioning. It is desirable to encourage directors and officers to enter new markets, develop new products, innovate, and take other business risks.\u201d 1 A.L.I., Principles of Corporate Governance (1994) \u00a7 4.01 (c) comment, p. 174; see footnote 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">Raymond claims that the trial court\u2019s application of the business judgment rule to Norman\u2019s conduct was clearly erroneous because Norman failed to exercise due care in his management of Metals Selling during the applicable period of Norman\u2019s control. These are factual claims. \u201cAppellate review of fact bound rulings of the trial court is limited to a determination of whether there has been a clearly erroneous finding of fact.\u201d <em>Adriani </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>228 Conn. 545, 548, 636 A.2d 1360 (1994); see also Practice Book \u00a7 4061.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> \u201cThe resolution of conflicting factual claims falls within the province of the trial court.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Commissioner of Health Services </em>v. <em>Youth Challenge of Greater Hartford, Inc., </em>219 Conn. 657, 666, 594 A.2d 958 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b811-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>There is ample evidence in the record that indicates that Norman exercised due care<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> in his management of Metals Selling. The trial court determined that Norman informed himself of material information reasonably available to him in his management of Metals Selling, and that in so doing he fulfilled his duty of care. The business judgment rule thus insulates Norman\u2019s management of Metals Selling from legal challenge. The trial court determined that Raymond had failed to show in accordance with the stipulation that Norman\u2019s conduct in connection with his management of Metals Selling was so egregious as to constitute \u201c \u2018fraud ... or gross mismanagement . . . inconsistent with normal business practices for similarly situated closely held corporations.\u2019 \u201d The trial court determined that Norman was, therefore, insulated from liability by the business judgment rule. We have no reason to disturb that conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">Raymond next claims that the trial court erroneously determined that payment of the legal fees of the law firm in this litigation by Metals Selling and Metalmast was proper. He argues that the trial court\u2019s finding that the corporations were real defendants in this litigation and, therefore, entitled to representation was clearly erroneous. He also argues that the trial court erroneously applied the law of estoppel to the concession by the law firm that the corporations had no independent position in the litigation. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-7\">The following additional facts are relevant to this claim. After the commencement of these four actions by Raymond, the law firm filed appearances in all four actions: for Norman in the derivative actions, in which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>the corporations were both plaintiffs and defendants, and for the corporations in the dissolution actions. Raymond objected to the law firm\u2019s representation of the corporations and moved to disqualify the firm, seeking independent representation for the corporations instead. His opposition was based on his desire not to subsidize Norman\u2019s defense with corporate moneys of which he was in effect a one-half owner. In opposition to that motion, Norman, through the law firm, conceded that the corporations were nominal parties in the litigation, the battleground for the dispute between the two brothers.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> On the basis of that concession, Raymond withdrew his motion to disqualify, without prejudice to his right to raise in the trial court the amount or propriety of fees paid to the law firm.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">At the evidentiary hearing in the trial court, Raymond challenged the propriety of the payment of the fees of the law firm by the corporations. The trial court determined that Norman had the requisite authority to retain counsel on behalf of the corporations, that the corporations had real interests in the litigation that required representation, and that they were entitled to representation of Norman\u2019s choosing.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">This claim arises in the context of joint legal representation of related parties in a shareholder\u2019s derivative suit. The derivative suit is an action brought on behalf of a corporation by some percentage of its shareholders. <em>Ross </em>v. <em>Bernhard, </em>396 U.S. 531, 538, 90 S. Ct. 733, 24 L. Ed. 2d 729 (1970). The corporation is in an anomalous position of being both a defendant and a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>plaintiff in the same action. This unusual posture for the corporation is the result of the historical evolution of the derivative suit. At common law, there was no action in law permitting a shareholder to call corporate managers to account. Id., 534. In equity, there were two actions that evolved into a single derivative action: in one action the corporation was named as a defendant in order to compel it to take action against its controlling officers; in the second, the shareholder maintained an action against the officers and directors of the corporation, on behalf of the corporation. The dual actions were cumbersome and evolved into the present day unitary derivative action.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">The shareholder is often only a nominal plaintiff in a derivative action.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The purpose of the derivative action is to compel assertion of a corporate right of action against a corporation\u2019s directors or officers when the corporation, usually under the control of the defendant officers and directors, refuses to sue on its own behalf. See <em>Cannon </em>v. <em>United States Acoustics Corp., </em>398 F. Sup. 209, 213, (N.D. 111.), modified on other grounds, 532 F.2d 1118 (7th Cir. 1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">In a derivative suit, the role of counsel for the corporation who is also counsel for the defendant directors can, under certain circumstances, be hampered by a conflict of interest.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Because the determination of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>whether joint representation of a corporation and its directors creates a conflict requiring separate counsel inevitably turns on the facts of a particular case, that determination is left to the discretion of the trial court. The propriety of dual representation in a derivative action \u201cmust be determined in light of the particular facts attending each such case.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Hausman </em>v. <em>Buckley, </em>299 F.2d 696, 699 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 369 U.S. 885, 82 S. Ct. 1157, 8 L. Ed. 2d 289 (1962). Similarly, the determination of whether these two corporations were real parties in interest, entitled to representation, is within the discretion of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-4\">\u201cIn determining whether the trial court abused its discretion, this court must make every reasonable presumption in favor of its action. <em>State </em>v. <em>Bitting, </em>162 Conn. 1, 11, 291 A.2d 240 (1971); <em>E. M. Loew\u2019s Enterprises, Inc. </em>v. <em>Surabian, </em>146 Conn. 608, 612, 153 A.2d 463 (1959). <em>Celanese Fiber, Division of Celanese of Canada, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Pic Yarns, Inc., </em>[184 Conn. 461, 466-67, 440 A.2d 159 (1981)].\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Red Rooster Construction Co. </em>v. <em>River Associates, Inc., </em>224 Conn. 563, 575, 620 A.2d 118 (1993). \u201cSuch discretion, however, imports something more than leeway in decision making and should be exercised in conformity with the spirit of the law and should not impede or defeat the ends of substantial justice.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">In this case, the trial court did not abuse its discretion. It determined that the corporations had real interests at stake in the litigation that required the assistance of counsel. Those interests included the fact that the dissolution suits put the continued existence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>of the corporations in jeopardy. The retention of counsel, therefore, served a proper business purpose. The trial court noted that, under those circumstances, it may have been a breach of the duty of care for Norman to have failed to retain counsel for the corporations.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">We are unpersuaded by Raymond\u2019s argument that the continued existence of a corporation cannot serve as a proper business purpose for the retention of counsel because the dissolution of a deadlocked corporation is mandatory under \u00a7 33-382 (a) (2). Retention of counsel is an ex ante proposition: a corporation cannot be precluded from retaining counsel at the outset because it may, in the end, face dissolution. Regardless of the ultimate disposition of the case, the corporation may wish to dispute allegations or otherwise mount a defense. We are unwilling to promulgate so broad a rule as Raymond suggests.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">Raymond\u2019s argument that Norman is estopped from maintaining that the corporations had an independent position from Norman\u2019s own is misplaced. It is true that, in response to Raymond\u2019s motion to disqualify the law firm from representing the corporations, the law firm conceded that the corporations did not have an independent position from Norman\u2019s. Norman was not precluded, in response to Raymond\u2019s effort to preclude the corporations from paying the law firm\u2019s fees, from arguing that the corporations had real interests in the litigation. When Raymond withdrew his motion to disqualify the law firm, but retained the option of later challenging the propriety of the payment of its legal fees by the corporations, he implicitly left open the door for Norman to assert that there were real corporate interests at stake that justified the retention of counsel for the corporations. Successful assertion of the doctrine of equitable estoppel requires proof of two elements: (1) a statement or action by the party against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>whom estoppel is claimed designed to induce reliance on that statement or action; and (2) a changed position by the second party in reliance on the act or statement of the first that results in loss or injury to the second party. See <em>Lunn </em>v. <em>Tokeneke Assn., Inc., </em>227 Conn. 601, 607, 630 A.2d 1335 (1993). \u201cFor estoppel to exist, there must be misleading conduct resulting in prejudice to the other party.\u201d Id.; <em>John F. Epina Realty, Inc. </em>v. <em>Space Realty, Inc., </em>194 Conn. 71, 85, 480 A.2d 499 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">Because Raymond could not have relied on a representation made by Norman in connection with a motion to disqualify for purposes of challenging the payment of corporate legal fees, he has failed to meet the first element of the two part test for equitable estoppel. We therefore reject his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b816-7\">Raymond next claims that the trial court improperly determined that Norman had not engaged in self-dealing transactions voidable under General Statutes \u00a7 33-323<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> by increasing the pay of his son, Paul, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>by directing Metalmast to increase rental payments it was making to Norman for the use by Metalmast of certain real property owned by him. Raymond argues that the trial court improperly allocated the burden of proof of demonstrating that the alleged self-dealing was fair, in good faith and for adequate consideration, by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>requiring that he, rather than Norman, bear that burden. Although we agree that the trial court incorrectly determined that Norman\u2019s conduct did not constitute self-dealing, we also conclude that the trial court\u2019s error was rendered harmless by means of an alternate conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">The following facts are relevant to this claim. Paul\u2019s salary was periodically raised by Norman from a base of $600 per week in 1984 to $1000 per week in 1987. Paul was also given a cash bonus of $20,000 in 1988. Neither these raises nor the bonus was approved by the board of directors or the shareholders of Metalmast.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">As noted above, after acquiring Raymond\u2019s one-half interest in the real property on which Metalmast and Metals Selling conducted the bulk of their operations, Norman directed Metals Selling to pay him the $5000 per month in rent that it had been previously paying to Metalmast as a subtenant on the property. Norman was also receiving $4000 per month in rent from Metalmast. Norman\u2019s action had the effect of increasing the aggregate rental payment he received on the property from $4000 per month to $9000 per month. It also diminished the revenues of Metalmast by $5000 per month. The trial court concluded that the fair market rent for the property was $10,000 per month. Raymond claimed that the unilateral decision by Norman to alter the terms of the rental arrangements between the tenants and the owners of the real property, by providing for payment by the subtenant directly to him rather than to the corporate tenant, constituted voidable self-dealing.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-7\">Ordinarily, business decisions made by officers and directors of corporations with the exercise of due care are insulated from challenge by the business judgment rule. Transactions made by a corporation with officers, directors or certain members of their immediate family, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>however, are subject to heightened scrutiny. At common law, such transactions were voidable by the corporation as self-dealing. H. Henn, supra, \u00a7 238. Section 33-323 provides a safe harbor for certain of these transactions by eliminating voidability for self-dealing transactions that meet certain requirements. These requirements include approval of the contract or transaction by shareholders or disinterested directors, or fairness to the corporation. See footnote 26. If a plaintiff can demonstrate that a transaction is self-dealing, the burden shifts to the defendant officer or director wishing to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of \u00a7 33-323 to demonstrate that the self-dealing transaction was completed in accordance with its provisions. See <em>Hadden </em>v. <em>Krevit, </em>186 Conn. 587, 590, 442 A.2d 944 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">Raymond argues that the trial court\u2019s determination that these transactions were not self-dealing by Norman is clearly erroneous. We agree. At common law, transactions by the corporation with an officer or with members of his immediate family were self-dealing.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Those transactions were voidable by the corporation under certain circumstances. In this case, the transaction between the corporation and the son of its president, and the rental of space by the corporation from its president, are examples of common law self-dealing.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">Notwithstanding the trial court\u2019s improper determination that the transactions were not self-dealing, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>also determined that the transactions were not unreasonable in the context in which they were made. This determination was supported by substantial evidence in the record. This evidence included references to an accountant\u2019s determinations made in connection with the auditor\u2019s report that the increase in salary and bonus paid to Paul was an unexceptional decision made in the ordinary course of business and was in keeping with past compensation practices at the two corporations. The court also reviewed extensive documentation concerning the use of the rental property, and the costs of comparable properties. It concluded that the rent that was charged by Norman to the two corporations was below fair market value.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">Section 33-323 (a) (4) provides that a contract or transaction between the corporation and an officer or a member of his immediate family shall not be voidable if \u201cthe contract or transaction is fair as to the corporation.\u201d See footnote 26. Because the trial court determined, on the basis of sufficient evidence, that the transactions complained of were fair as to the corporation, its improper determination that the transactions were not self-dealing is harmless. A trial court may err in a conclusion and render that error harmless by an alternative conclusion. <em>Lavigne </em>v. <em>Lavigne, </em>3 Conn. App. 423, 425, 488 A.2d 1290 (1985). Accordingly, we reject Raymond\u2019s claim.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b820-6\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b820-7\">Raymond\u2019s final claim is that the trial court improperly failed to hold Norman liable for appraisal costs in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>connection with the dissolution actions. Raymond argues that the terms of General Statutes \u00a7 33-S84<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> establish a statutory formula for taxing appraisal costs, and that the trial court improperly determined that he had, pursuant to the stipulation, waived his right to these costs. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">The language of the stipulation established a method, distinct from that contemplated by \u00a7 33-384, for apportioning costs in connection with the liquidation of the companies. Specifically, the stipulation provided a mechanism under which each brother was given an opportunity to purchase the other\u2019s interest. The stipulation also provided that if neither brother elected to purchase the other\u2019s interest, the court was to liquidate the assets of the corporations in a manner deemed appropriate by the court, and provided further that the fees of the auditor be paid by the corporations.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>The interpretation of the stipulation was within the sound discretion of the trial court. The trial court determined that by entering into the stipulation, subsequent to the refusal by both brothers to purchase the other\u2019s shares pursuant to the appraisal, each had implicitly waived the statutory formula for taxing costs and had expressly provided instead that the corporations bear those costs. That finding is supported by adequate evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b795-9\"> Norman Rosenfield died on February 23,1994, and we granted permission to substitute Ms executrix as defendant.

In any proceeding to void such contract or transaction, the court may, if it deems it equitable, rescind the contract or transaction in whole or in part, or award damages, or both, but the rights of third parties shall be protected.</p>\n<p id=\"AAa\">\u201c(d) For the purposes of this section: (1) \u2018Member of the immediate family\u2019 means spouse, parents and children; (2) \u2018substantial interest\u2019 shall exclude: (i) The interest of a person in a corporation, firm or other organization as a debt or equity holder therein where the debt or equity held is less than ten per cent of the outstanding debt or equity, as the case may be, of such corporation, firm or other organization; (ii) the interest of a person in a corporation, firm or other organization by reason of being a director, officer or employee, or their equivalents, thereof; (iii) the interest of a director of a corporation or a member of his immediate family in another corporation, firm or other organization which arises by reason of the fact that the corporation has a debt or equity interest in such other corporation, firm or other organization; (3) any contract or transaction between a corporation and a person, corporation, firm or other organization made in the ordinary course of business at standard prices or on terms not less favorable to the corporation than those offered by the person, corporation, firm or other organization to others, shall be prima facie fair.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b819-7\"> Raymond\u2019s reliance on General Statutes \u00a7 33-323 for the proposition that transactions between a corporation and its officers or their immediate family are voidable is misplaced. That statute delineates a safe harbor, eliminating voidability as a remedy for self-dealing transactions meeting certain requirements. The statute is not a codification of the common law rule that self-dealing transactions were voidable by the corporation under certain circumstances. In effect, the statute implicitly incorporates the common law principle of voidability of self-dealing transactions, but modifies that principle by providing a safe harbor for transactions that meet the statutory terms.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b820-8\"> Raymond also argues that the trial court misapplied the burden of demonstrating lack of reasonableness of the self-dealing transactions to him rather than the reasonableness of the transactions to Norman. Because the trial court determined that the transactions were not self-dealing, it was not necessary for Norman to demonstrate that the self-dealing fell within one of the safe harbor provisions of General Statutes \u00a7 33-323. Raymond\u2019s argument in this instance is therefore inapplicable to the circumstances of this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b821-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 33-384 provides in relevant part: \u201capplication by SHAREHOLDER FOR APPRAISAL OF PETITIONER\u2019S SHARES, (a) Whenever a petition for judicial winding up is filed by a shareholder or shareholders as provided in section 33-382, hereinafter in this section referred to as \u2018petitioner,\u2019 any other shareholder may at any time within sixty days after the filing of such petition, or at such later time as the court in its discretion may allow, apply to the court to have the fair value of the petitioner\u2019s shares appraised.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-7\">\u201c(b) The court shall thereupon by its judgment determine the fair value of the petition\u2019s shares as of the day prior to the date on which such petition was filed, exclusive of any element of value arising from such filing. It may, if it so elects, appoint one or more persons as appraisers to receive evidence and recommend a decision on the question of fair value. The appraisers shall have such power and authority as shall be specified in the order of their appointment or an amendment thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-8\">\u201c(c) Within ten days after written notice from the clerk of the court that such appraisal has been filed, the applicant shall file with the court a signed statement stating whether he elects to buy the petitioner\u2019s shares at the appraisal.

Upon entry of such order of sale, the petitioner shall no longer be a shareholder of the corporation except for purposes of appeal therefrom and, upon motion of the applicant, the petition or judicial winding up proceeding shall be dismissed and such other orders entered continuing the corporation as the court may direct. The court may direct that notice of such dismissal be given to such interested persons as it deems proper and may take all such reasonable action as it deems proper to provide fair opportunity for shareholders desiring to continue the corporation to purchase the shares of shareholders desiring to dissolve the corporation, and fair opportunity for the latter to sell their shares to the former, at the appraised fair value thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"ArQ\">\u201c(e) If the applicant fails to make the deposit as provided in subsection (c), the proceeding shall proceed in due course.
