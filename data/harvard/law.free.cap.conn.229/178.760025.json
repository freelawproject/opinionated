J.</author>\n<p id=\"A9H\">The dispositive issue in this case is whether the governing statutes give this court subject matter jurisdiction over a writ of error brought to review the denial of a petition for a writ of habeas corpus after the habeas court has denied certification to appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The plaintiff in error, Floyd Simms (plaintiff), filed an amended petition for a writ of habeas corpus to challenge the legality of his detention by the defendant in error, the warden of the Connecticut correctional institution at Somers (state). In his petition for a writ of habeas corpus, the plaintiff maintained that his 1983 conviction of accessory to assault of a person sixty years of age or older in the first degree pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-59 (a) (3), 53a-59a and 53a-8 and robbery in the second degree pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 53a-135 (a) (3) should be set aside or that he should be resentenced.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> His three count petition alleged ineffective assistance of trial counsel, ineffective assistance of appellate counsel and impairment of his rights to due process under the federal and state constitutions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The habeas court dismissed the count of the petition claiming a constitutional deprivation of due process<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and, after an evidentiary hear<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>ing,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> denied the counts of the petition claiming ineffective assistance of counsel. The habeas court thereafter denied the plaintiffs petition for certification to appeal. Without attempting to appeal from this denial, the plaintiff filed this writ of error. We conclude that the writ of error must be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">In this court, the plaintiffs contentions in support of his writ of error mirror the substantive and the procedural arguments that he presented to the habeas court. The state maintains, however, that we lack subject matter jurisdiction to review the merits of the plaintiff s case because, under General Statutes \u00a7 52-273, \u201c[n]o writ of error may be brought in any civil or criminal proceeding for the correction of any error which might have been reviewed by process of appeal.\u201d We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">Once an issue of subject matter jurisdiction has come to our attention, we cannot adjudicate a case on its merits without first determining whether we have the authority to proceed. <em>Gagnon </em>v. <em>Planning Commission, </em>222 Conn. 294, 297, 608 A.2d 1181 (1992); <em>Concerned Citizens of Sterling </em>v. <em>Sterling, </em>204 Conn. 551, 556-57, 529 A.2d 666 (1987). \u201c[Jjurisdiction of the subject matter is a question of law and cannot be waived or conferred by consent either in the trial court or here.\u201d <em>Serrani </em>v. <em>Board of Ethics, </em>225 Conn. 305, 308, 622 A.2d 1009 (1993). \u201c[T]he court has a duty to dismiss, even on its own initiative, any appeal that it lacks jurisdiction to hear.\u201d <em>Sasso </em>v. <em>Aleshin, </em>197 Conn. 87, 89, 495 A.2d 1066 (1985); <em>Tomlinson </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>226 Conn. 704, 718, 629 A.2d 333 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>The subject matter jurisdiction of this court is defined by statute. <em>Ambroise </em>v. <em>William Raveis Real Estate, Inc., </em>226 Conn. 757, 759-60, 628 A.2d 1303 (1993); <em>Grieco </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>226 Conn. 230, 231, 627 A.2d 432 (1993); <em>State </em>v. <em>Ayala, </em>222 Conn. 331, 338-41, 610 A.2d 1162 (1992); <em>State </em>v. <em>Curcio, </em>191 Conn. 27, 30, 463 A.2d 566 (1983); <em>Chipman </em>v. <em>Waterbury, </em>59 Conn. 496, 497, 22 A. 289 (1890). The central issue before us, therefore, is whether \u00a7 52-273 confers jurisdiction on this court to review the disposition of a petition for a writ of habeas corpus after denial of certification to appeal. This issue can usefully be divided into the following subparts: (1) Does \u00a7 52-273 permit writs of error for review of judgments rendered in habeas corpus proceedings? (2) If \u00a7 52-273 does not permit such a writ of error, does Practice Book \u00a7 4143 nevertheless provide authority for such a writ of error? (3) If neither the statute nor the Practice Book permits a writ of error to be brought, what avenues of appellate review are available to challenge an adverse judgment in a habeas corpus proceeding?</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">On its face, the text of \u00a7 52-273 strongly suggests that the plaintiff may not bring a writ of error in the circumstances of this case. The statute disallows a writ of error \u201cfor the correction of any error which <em>might </em>have been reviewed by process of appeal.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Although the plaintiff does not have an unqualified right to appeal from the denial of his petition for a writ of habeas corpus, he would have had such a right if, in accordance with the provisions of General Statutes \u00a7 52-470 (b),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> either the habeas court or an appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>late judge had certified that \u201ca question is involved in the decision which ought to be reviewed . . . .\u201d The availability of this qualified right of appeal is sufficient to deny the plaintiff access to a statutory right to a writ of error. See C. Tait, Connecticut Appellate Practice and Procedure (2d Ed. 1993) \u00a7 8.3. This case is one example of a request for a review of errors that, in the language of \u00a7 52-273, \u201cmight have been reviewed by process of appeal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">As a matter of statutory construction, this result is entirely consistent with the manifest intention of the legislature, when it enacted \u00a7 52-470 (b), to limit the opportunity for plenary appellate review of decisions in cases seeking postconviction review of criminal convictions. The legislature amended the predecessor statute to \u00a7 52-470 (b) for this specific purpose.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> See <em>Iovieno </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>222 Conn. 254, 259-60, 608 A.2d 1174 (1992). At the same time, it also amended the statute governing a petition for a new trial in a criminal case, now General Statutes \u00a7 54-95 (a),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>require a similar certification as a condition on the right to appeal. Having restricted the right to appeal, under both statutes, to cases in which a judge or justice has specifically determined that further review is appropriate, the legislature could not have intended a writ of error to serve as an alternate, unrestricted route for appellate review.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">Despite this consistent and unambiguous manifestation of legislative intent, the plaintiff maintains that court rules of procedure and judicial precedents entitle him to bring a writ of error. We are unpersuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-8\">The Practice Book provision on which the plaintiff principally relies is \u00a7 4143 (b) (1). Subsection (b) (1) provides: \u201cNo writ of error may be brought in any civil or criminal proceeding for the correction of any error where (1) the error might have been reviewed by process of appeal, or by way of certification, except that the state may bring a writ of error where it has been denied certification to appeal in a habeas corpus proceeding pursuant to Gen. Stat. \u00a7 52-470 (b) and a petitioner may bring a writ of error in a habeas corpus proceeding requiring certification to appeal where petitioner has been denied certification to appeal and the issues sought to be raised do not present any federal question cognizable by the federal district court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b205-9\">The plaintiff contends that he may invoke the provisions of \u00a7 4143 (b) because, in his view, its provisions are consistent with the provisions of \u00a7 52-273. We disagree. A textual comparison of the two provisions ineluctably demonstrates that, after a denial by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>habeas court of certification to appeal that is not an abuse of discretion, the statute precludes access to a writ of error, while the Practice Book authorizes its use. To the extent that \u00a7 4143 (b) (1) is inconsistent with the provisions of the General Statutes, our jurisdiction to consider a writ of error is governed by the applicable statutes. Provisions of the Practice Book cannot confer jurisdiction on this court. See General Statutes \u00a7 51-14;<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Ambroise </em>v. <em>William Raveis Real Estate, Inc., </em>supra, 226 Conn. 759-60; <em>Grieco </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>supra, 226 Conn. 231; <em>State </em>v. <em>Ayala, </em>supra, 222 Conn. 338-41; <em>State </em>v. <em>Curcio, </em>supra, 191 Conn. 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">The stark textual contrast between the statute and the Practice Book is heightened by the fact that, since the 1986 amendments to the Practice Book, the scope of review afforded by a writ of error is no longer limited to errors of law \u201capparent on the face of the record.\u201d Practice Book, 1963, \u00a7 3090 (now \u00a7 4143). Instead, Practice Book \u00a7 4144 now provides that procedures for a writ of error \u201cshall be in accordance with the rules for appeals.\u201d See <em>Bergeron </em>v. <em>Mackler, </em>225 Conn. 391, 393 n.3, 623 A.2d 489 (1993); C. Tait, supra, \u00a7 8.6. Permitting a writ of error in accordance with \u00a7 4143 of the Practice Book would therefore authorize a plenary review that is the functional equivalent of an ordinary appeal. Such a use of the writ of error would effectively write the certification requirement out of \u00a7 52-470 (b).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>A litigant disappointed by the outcome of a habeas corpus proceeding could <em>always </em>obtain plenary review of its merits, either on appeal if certification to appeal were granted, or through a writ of error if certification to appeal were denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">Even if such inconsistency would normally require the provisions of the Practice Book to give way to the governing provisions of the jurisdictional statutes, the plaintiff contends that this court\u2019s past practice of reviewing habeas corpus decisions on writs of error establishes the legitimacy of this procedural route. In essence, this argument suggests that decisions of this court estop the state from insistence on compliance with the governing statutes. To state this argument is to refute it. Constraints on our jurisdiction cannot be waived by anyone, including this court. <em>Ambroise </em>v. <em>William Raveis Real Estate, Inc., </em>supra, 226 Conn. 766-67; <em>Castro </em>v. <em>Viera, </em>207 Conn. 420, 429-30, 541 A.2d 1216 (1988). To the extent that our precedents imply that a writ of error may be brought in the circumstances of this case, these precedents are mistaken and are hereby overruled.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">The unavailability of appellate review of habeas corpus proceedings by means of a writ of error does not leave a disappointed litigant remediless to obtain review of the merits of the habeas corpus judgment. The litigant may, of course, persuade either the habeas court, or an appellate judge or justice, to permit a further appeal. The fact that certification to appeal may be sought from someone other than the judge hearing the habeas case is a significant protection of the rights that habeas corpus proceedings are intended to protect. <em>Gaines </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>194 Conn. 510, 516, 481 A.2d 1084 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">Even if certification to appeal is denied, however, the disappointed litigant does not lack further recourse. The petitioner or the state, as the case may be, can nonetheless file an appeal in the proper appellate forum.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In such an appeal, the first issue for the appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>late tribunal will necessarily be whether it has jurisdiction to hear the appeal. Appellate tribunals are regularly called upon to determine their own jurisdiction, which may be brought into question either by a motion to dismiss or by appropriate briefing of the issue. For example, before reaching the merits of appellate litigation, appellate tribunals routinely resolve disagreements about the timeliness of an appeal, the presence or absence of a final judgment from which to appeal, or the occurrence of intervening events that may have rendered an appeal moot. A similar threshold jurisdictional question will be presented in any case in which, despite the absence of certification to appeal, an appellate tribunal is asked to determine the merits of a habeas corpus judgment involving a criminal conviction. Before addressing the merits, the appellate tribunal will have to decide whether the habeas court\u2019s denial of certification was an abuse of that court\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">Construing \u00a7 52-470 (b) to permit appellate scrutiny of the denial of certification to appeal is consistent not only with the salutary purposes of the writ of habeas corpus; <em>Gaines </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>supra, 194 A.2d 516; but with other statutes establishing certification requirements that expressly preclude further appellate review. \u201cBecause the legislature is always presumed to have created a harmonious and consistent body of law, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>read statutes together when they relate to the same subject matter.\u201d <em>Daly </em>v. <em>DelPonte, </em>225 Conn. 499, 510, 624 A.2d 876 (1993); <em>Concerned Citizens of Sterling, Inc. </em>v. <em>Connecticut Siting Council, </em>215 Conn. 474, 482-83, 576 A.2d 510 (1990); <em>Dart &amp; Bogue Co. </em>v. <em>Slosberg, </em>202 Conn. 566, 575, 522 A.2d 763 (1987). Although \u00a7\u00a7 52-470 (b) and 54-95 (a) both require certification to appeal, neither statute includes a provision that denial of the requisite certification is final and dispositive. By contrast, in General Statutes \u00a7 8-8,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> governing zoning appeals and in General Statutes \u00a7 51-197f,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> governing appeals from final judgments of the Appellate Court, the legislature has expressly stated that, upon the denial of certification to appeal, there shall be \u201cno right to further review.\u201d See also General Statutes \u00a7 46b-231 (n) and (o), governing appeals from family magistrates.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">Although we have not previously articulated the standard of review on direct appeal of the denial of certifi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>cation under \u00a7\u00a7 52-470 (b) or 54-95 (a), we have considered a similar issue in related cases. When we determined that a writ of error to review such a denial would require the showing of an abuse of discretion; <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>223 Conn. 411, 414, 611 A.2d 413 (1992); we relied on case law under General Statutes \u00a7 54-96, which authorizes a trial court to permit the state to appeal questions of law in criminal cases. In that context, we have held that, on appeal, the issue is whether the record manifests a \u201cclear and extreme abuse of discretion\u201d or whether \u201cinjustice appears to have been done.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Avcollie, </em>174 Conn. 100, 110-11, 384 A.2d 315 (1977); <em>State </em>v. <em>Bergin, </em>214 Conn. 657, 660-61, 574 A.2d 164 (1990); <em>State v. S &amp; R Sanitation Services, Inc., </em>202 Conn. 300, 312, 521 A.2d 1017 (1987). In similar fashion, therefore, we construe \u00a7 52-470 (b) to permit a disappointed habeas corpus litigant to invoke appellate jurisdiction for plenary review of the decision of the habeas court upon carrying the burden of persuasion that denial of certification to appeal was an abuse of discretion or that an injustice appears to have been done.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">The writ of error is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">In this opinion Santaniello and Dupont, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b201-7\"> In a companion case, <em>Carpenter </em>v. <em>Meachum, </em>229 Conn. 193, 640 A.2d 591 (1994), we have today considered and rejected a constitutional challenge to the validity of General Statutes \u00a7 52-273.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b201-8\"> The Appellate Court affirmed the plaintiff\u2019s criminal conviction in <em>State </em>v. <em>Simms, </em>14 Conn.

That remedy is, however, statutory. To date, the legislature has provided such a remedy only for appeals of orders prohibiting attendance at any session of court; General Statutes \u00a7 51-164x (a); and of orders relating to the disclosure of the records of an investigatory grand jury.

See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253; Fed. R. App. P. 22 (b); see also L. Yackle, Postconviction Remedies (1981) \u00a7 160.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-10\">The Supreme Court of the United States has instructed federal courts that a certificate of probable cause should issue whenever a petitioner makes \u201ca substantial showing of a denial of [a] federal right.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Lozada </em>v. <em>Deeds, </em>498 U.S. 430, 431, 111 S. Ct. 860, 112 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>L. Ed. 2d 956 (1991); <em>Barefoot </em>v. <em>Estelle, </em>463 U.S. 880, 892-93, 103 S. Ct. 3383, 77 L. Ed. 2d 1090 (1983). To make such a showing, \u201ca petitioner who has been denied relief in a district court must demonstrate that the issues are debatable among jurists of reason; that a court <em>could, </em>resolve the issues [in a different manner]; or that the questions are adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d (Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Lozada </em>v. <em>Deeds, </em>supra, 432.</p>\n<p id=\"Alf\">We do not need to decide today whether the federal standard should guide the granting or denial of certification to appeal under General Statutes \u00a7 52-470 (b). Justice Berdon\u2019s dissent in the companion case of <em>Carpenter </em>v. <em>Meachum, </em>229 Conn. 193, 203, 640 A.2d 591 (1994), therefore, raises issues that are not properly before us in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b211-8\">Borden, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A-E\">concurring. I fully agree with parts I and II of the majority opinion. I decline to join part III, however, in which the majority states that a disappointed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>habeas corpus litigant, whose petition for certification under General Statutes \u00a7 52-470 (b) has been denied, may nonetheless file a direct appeal, the threshold issue of which would be whether the denial of the certification petition was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">First, part III of the opinion is dictum. Whether such an appeal is permissible under \u00a7 52-470 (b) was not raised in this case, was not briefed by either party, and is not necessary to our decision that a writ of error does not lie following the denial of certification to appeal. Experience has demonstrated that we are wiser to defer difficult questions to cases that squarely present them. I would follow that wisdom and defer the question to a case in which the issue is squarely presented and briefed.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">Second, I am not prepared necessarily to agree with the reasoning of the majority on its interpretation of \u00a7 52-470 (b), at least without much further thought and research than this case has presented to us. I am not persuaded, at this time, by the comparisons to the zoning appeal certification statute; General Statutes \u00a7 8-8; and to the statute regarding certified appeals to this court from judgments of the Appellate Court. General Statutes \u00a7 51-197\u00cd. The fact that \u00a7 52-470 (b) does not contain the same emphatic language regarding the lack of further review that is contained in those statutes is not conclusive on the question of whether the legisla<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>ture\u2019s intent in enacting \u00a7 52-470 (b) was just as emphatic. See <em>Iovieno </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>222 Conn. 254, 259-60, 608 A.2d 1174 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">Third, I am not prepared to equate, as does the majority, \u00a7 52-470 (b) with the state\u2019s appellate rights pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-96, again, at least without further thought and scholarship on the issue. There are several significant differences between \u00a7 52-470 (b) and \u00a7 54-96 that, arguably, could require differing treatments of the right to appeal following the denial by the trial court of a certification to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">Section 52-470 (b) was enacted to limit appellate rights that previously existed; see <em>Iovieno </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 222 Conn. 259; whereas \u00a7 54-96 was enacted to create appellate rights that previously had not existed. Furthermore, under \u00a7 52-470 (b), unlike under \u00a7 54-96, the disappointed litigant has the option of applying to a judge of the Appellate Court or a justice of this court for certification to appeal, rather than relying on the determination of the habeas judge who made the initial decision. In addition, an unsuccessful habeas petitioner who has been denied certification to appeal under \u00a7 52-470 (b) will, in most cases, have federal habeas corpus available to him. Thus, a denial of certification under \u00a7 52-470 (b) will not be the end of the line for such a litigant, whereas absent the residual opportunity of the state to appeal following the denial of the state\u2019s petition for certification under \u00a7 54-96, such a denial would be the end of the state\u2019s case. This difference is particularly pertinent in a case such as this, in which the petitioner\u2019s substantive claim is that his federal constitutional right to effective representation of counsel was violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-8\">Finally, the majority\u2019s implied invitation to appeal, directed to all disappointed habeas petitioners denied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>certification to appeal, could well eviscerate the limitations contained in \u00a7 52-470 (b). In effect, the denial of the petition for certification could become an empty gesture, because one does not need to be prescient to foresee that every disappointed habeas petitioner could, once his petition for certification is denied, file or perfect a direct appeal under the same statute. Although, under the majority\u2019s analysis, the \u201cthreshold\u201d issue will be whether the denial of the \u00a7 52-470 (b) petition was an abuse of discretion, that will not prevent the appeal itself, nor is it likely that the threshold issue will be a jurisdictional issue that we will be able to dispose of prior to hearing the appeal on its merits. Unlike a question of whether an appeal was timely, a question of whether the habeas court abused its discretion requires an examination of the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">Thus, it is difficult for me, again at least at this stage of the process, to understand why the legislature would have limited the right to appeal as it did under \u00a7 52-470 (b), and at the same time, nonetheless, intended to permit a full appeal, the first issue of which would be whether the court abused its discretion under \u00a7 52-470 (b) in denying a petition for certification. I see no justification for reaching out to find such an intent in a case, such as this, that does not present the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">Berdon, J., dissenting. I respectfully dissent for the reasons stated in my dissenting opinion in <em>Carpenter v. Meachum, </em>229 Conn. 193, 203, 640 A.2d 591 (1994).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
