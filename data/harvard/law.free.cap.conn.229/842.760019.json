General Statutes \u00a7 42-110a et seq.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The plaintiff appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c). We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>We have previously recited the relevant undisputed facts. <em>Lees </em>v. <em>Middlesex Ins. Co., </em>219 Conn. 644, 648, 594 A.2d 952 (1991). \u201cOn May 9,1982, a fire destroyed the home of the plaintiff. At the time of the loss, the plaintiffs home was insured by the defendant. On August 9, 1982, the plaintiff filed two proof of loss statements with the defendant, one for loss of the dwelling and the other for loss of the contents of the dwell<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>ing. By letter dated August 16, 1982, the defendant rejected both proofs of loss as being \u2018excessive and premature.\u2019 On November 1,1982, the defendant paid the plaintiff\u2019s claim for loss of the dwelling but, without explanation, made no payment on the claim for loss of the contents. There was no further communication between the parties until August 23, 1983, when the plaintiff made a written inquiry requesting an explanation for the denial of her loss of contents claim.\u201d The defendant failed to respond to the plaintiff\u2019s inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-6\">On August 16,1985, the plaintiff filed a three count complaint alleging that the defendant had: (1) breached the insurance contract; (2) engaged in unfair insurance practices in violation of CUIPA; and (3) engaged in unfair trade practices in violation of CUTPA. The defendant moved for summary judgment on the ground that the plaintiff\u2019s claims were barred by the one year suit limitation provision in the fire insurance contract. The trial court, <em>Thompson, J., </em>rendered summary judgment in favor of the defendant on all three counts, and the Appellate Court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. <em>Lees </em>v. <em>Middlesex Ins. Co., </em>23 Conn. App. 814, 581 A.2d 287 (1990). We granted the plaintiff\u2019s petition for certification to appeal limited to the issue of whether the Appellate Court had correctly concluded that the plaintiff\u2019s CUIPA and CUTPA claims were barred by the one year limit for a suit on the policy.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We reversed the judgment of the Appellate Court and remanded the case for further proceedings in the trial court. <em>Lees </em>v. <em>Middlesex Ins. Co., </em>supra, 219 Conn. 657.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-7\">On remand, the defendant moved for summary judgment claiming, inter alia, that its alleged conduct in failing to settle the plaintiff\u2019s loss of contents claim did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number>not, as a matter of law, constitute an unfair or deceptive practice prohibited by CUIPA or CUTPA. The trial court, <em>Lewis, J., </em>rendered summary judgment in favor of the defendant, concluding that the undisputed evidence failed to satisfy the requirement that the defendant had committed or performed unfair claim settlement practices \u201cwith such frequency as to indicate a general business practice\u201d; General Statutes \u00a7 38a-816 (6); and that absent a viable CUIPA claim, the plaintiff could not prevail under CUTPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-4\">On appeal, the plaintiff contends that the trial court, in granting the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment, incorrectly concluded that: (1) multiple acts of misconduct by the defendant in the handling of the plaintiff\u2019s single insurance claim were not sufficient to satisfy the requirement of General Statutes \u00a7 38a-816 (6) that the defendant had engaged in unfair settlement practices \u201cwith such frequency as to indicate a general business practice\u201d; and (2) the plaintiff could not prevail on her CUTPA count in the absence of a viable cause of action under CUIPA. We do not agree with the plaintiff\u2019s claims.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b869-6\">The plaintiff acknowledges that a claim under CUIPA predicated upon alleged unfair claim settlement practices in violation of \u00a7 38a-816 (6) requires proof that the unfair settlement practices were committed or per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>formed \u201cwith such frequency as to indicate a general business practice.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Mead </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>199 Conn. 651, 509 A.2d 11 (1986). The plaintiff contends, contrary to the conclusion of the trial court, that proof of an insurer\u2019s commission of two or more unfair claim settlement practices in relation to only one insurance claim is sufficient to satisfy the \u201cgeneral business practice\u201d requirement of \u00a7 38a-816 (6). Therefore, although the plaintiff has not alleged unfair settlement practices by the defendant in its handling of any other insurance claim or claims,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> she maintains that the defendant\u2019s improper conduct in connection with her loss of contents claim is sufficient to establish the defendant\u2019s liability under CUIPA.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We are not persuaded by the plaintiff\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 38a-816 (6).</p>\n<p id=\"b871-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>In requiring proof that the insurer has engaged in unfair claim settlement practices \u201cwith such frequency as to indicate a general business practice,\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the legislature has manifested a clear intent to exempt from coverage under CUIPA isolated instances of insurer misconduct. <em>Mead </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>supra, 199 Conn. 666. The gravamen of the plaintiff\u2019s claim is that the defendant unfairly failed to settle her claim, and her claim alone. We conclude that the defendant\u2019s alleged improper conduct in the handling of a single insurance claim, without any evidence of misconduct by the defendant in the processing of any other claim, does not rise to the level of a \u201cgeneral business practice\u201d as required by \u00a7 38a-816 (6).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b871-6\">Practice Book \u00a7 384 provides that summary judgment \u201cshall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, affidavits and any other proof submitted show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d \u201cIn deciding a motion for summary judgment, the trial court must view the evidence in the light most <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>favorable to the nonmoving party.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Scrapchansky </em>v. <em>Plainfield, </em>226 Conn. 446, 450, 627 A.2d 1329 (1993); <em>Connecticut Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Carriage Lane Associates, </em>219 Conn. 772, 780-81, 595 A.2d 334 (1991). Because the defendant\u2019s alleged unfair claim settlement practices, viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, did not constitute a \u201cgeneral business practice\u201d under \u00a7 38a-816 (6), the trial court properly granted the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the CUIPA count.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b872-7\">The plaintiff also contends that the trial court improperly granted the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the CUTPA claim. The plaintiff argues that the trial court incorrectly concluded that the CUTPA count, based on the same alleged unfair claim settlement practices as the CUIPA count,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> required proof that the defendant\u2019s conduct constituted a \u201cgeneral business practice.\u201d We have previously considered and rejected this precise argument. In <em>Mead </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>supra, 199 Conn. 651, we concluded that a CUTPA claim based on an alleged unfair claim settlement practice prohibited by \u00a7 38a-816 (6) required proof, as under CUIPA, that the unfair settlement practice had been committed or performed by the defendant \u201cwith such frequency as to indicate a general business practice.\u201d In so holding, we observed that a CUTPA claim based on the public policy embodied in CUIPA must be consistent with the regulatory principles established therein, and that \u201c[t]he definition of unacceptable insurer conduct in [\u00a7 38a-816 (6)] reflects the legisla<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>tive determination that isolated instances of unfair insurance settlement practices are not so violative of the public policy of this state as to warrant statutory intervention.\u201d Id., 666. Because the plaintiff\u2019s evidence was insufficient to satisfy the requirement under CUIPA that the defendant\u2019s alleged unfair claim settlement practices constituted a \u201cgeneral business practice,\u201d the plaintiff\u2019s CUTPA claim could not survive the failure of her CUIPA claim. Accordingly, the trial court properly rendered summary judgment for the defendant on the CUTPA count. The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b865-11\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1981) \u00a7 38-60 provides: \u201cunfair practice prohibited.

With respect to the CUIPA count, the defendant contends that CUIPA does not create a private cause of action. We decline to consider that claim because it is unnecessary for us to do so. See <em>Mead </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>199 Conn. 651, 657 n.5, 509 A.2d 11 (1986); <em>Griswold </em>v. <em>Union Labor Life Ins. Co., </em>186 Conn. 507, 521 n.12, 442 A.2d 920 (1982). We similarly need not reach the defendant\u2019s contention that the plaintiff\u2019s CUTPA count must fail because she has not demonstrated an \u201cascertainable loss\u201d under General Statutes \u00a7 42-110g (a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b870-6\"> We note that of the sixteen categories of unfair insurance practices proscribed by General Statutes \u00a7 38a-816, only subsection (6) expressly requires proof that the unfair claim settlement practices enumerated therein were committed or performed \u201cwith such frequency as to indicate a general business practice.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b870-7\"> The plaintiff suggests that the trial court, in granting the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment, improperly failed to consider three other suits filed against the defendant and two complaints against the defendant lodged with the insurance commissioner, all alleging CUIPA violations. The trial court correctly concluded, however, that the only misconduct alleged by the plaintiff in her complaint concerned the defendant\u2019s handling of the plaintiff\u2019s loss of contents claim. Furthermore, the record reflects, and the plaintiff does not dispute, that the three suits alleging CUIPA violations by the defendant were withdrawn, and the complaints were resolved on the basis of the defendant\u2019s responses to the insurance commissioner. Because the plaintiff adduced no additional facts or information concerning any of those matters, the trial court properly determined that they were of no evidentiary value. See <em>Dowling </em>v. <em>Kielak, </em>160 Conn. 14, 18, 273 A.2d 716 (1970).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b870-8\"> Specifically, the plaintiff contends that the defendant failed: (1) to acknowledge and act with reasonable promptness upon her inquiries about the claim; General Statutes \u00a7 38a-816 (6) (b); (2) to affirm or deny coverage within a reasonable time after submission of the required proof of loss statements; General Statutes \u00a7 38a-816 (6) (e); (3) to make a good faith effort to effectuate a prompt, fair and equitable settlement of her claim, even though the defendant\u2019s liability on the claim had become reasonably clear; General Statutes \u00a7 38a-816 (6) (f); and (4) to provide promptly \u201ca reason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>able explanation of the basis in the insurance policy in relation to the facts or applicable law for denial\u201d of the claim.

App. 660, 671-72, 613 A.2d 838 (1992), where the court held that the plaintiff\u2019s allegation of multiple unfair claim settlement practices by the defendant insurer in the handling of the plan-tiff\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation claim, absent an allegation of unfair settlement practices by the insurer in the handling of other claims, failed to state a cause of action under CUIPA. See also <em>Aguilar </em>v. <em>United National Ins. Co., </em>825 F. Sup. 456 (D. Conn. 1993) (allegation of several unfair claim settlement practices by insurer in connection with a single claim does not state a claim under CUIPA).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b872-8\"> The plaintiff asserts, without further elaboration or substantiation, that her CUTPA claim is not based solely on the defendant\u2019s alleged CUIPA violations. This assertion, however, is contradicted by the complaint and the plaintiff\u2019s response to the defendant\u2019s request to revise, each of which makes plain that the plaintiff\u2019s CUTPA claim is based on the same alleged conduct as the CUIPA claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
