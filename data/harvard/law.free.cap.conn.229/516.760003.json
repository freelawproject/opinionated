On June 11,1990, the defendant entered into a written agreement with Salvatore and Janice Arena to build a three room addition to their Monroe residence in return for $28,000. On July 31, 1990, the defendant entered into a written agreement with Thomas Story. That agreement provided that the defendant would make home improvements to Story\u2019s Woodbury residence in return for $4350. During the period between December, 1990, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>July, 1991, the defendant reshingled the roof, boxed in the chimney and installed soffit vents on Story\u2019s house. On October 5,1990, the defendant entered into a written agreement with Vivian Chabot to remodel the kitchen in her Woodbury residence for the price of $10,500. The defendant performed a portion of the work between January and June, 1991, but did not completely remodel the kitchen. On October 10, 1990, the defendant entered into a written agreement with Fred Thorpe and his wife to build two closets, an office and a bathroom with a whirlpool bath at the Thorpes\u2019 Wood-bury residence for a price of $27,400. The defendant made those home improvements between November, 1990, and August, 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">The state also offered the testimony of Olivia Martinchek, a consumer information representative in the complaint center of the frauds division of the Connecticut department of consumer protection. Martincheck testified that she was the supervisor of the home improvement unit of the frauds division from July, 1985, through December, 1991, and that she was familiar with the procedures by which home improvement contractors were issued certificates of registration. She further testified that she was familiar with the records regarding the defendant\u2019s registration as a home improvement contractor in the state of Connecticut. Martinchek testified that the defendant had been registered first on May 20, 1982, with yearly renewals through May 1, 1987, and again on April 1, 1989, through May 1, 1990, but that he had not held a valid certificate of registration at any time thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">After the state had rested its case, the defendant neither presented evidence nor testified. Without presenting a theory of defense to the jury, he elected to rely on the prospect that the state had not carried its burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt the elements of a violation of \u00a7 20-427 (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>The jury returned a verdict of guilty of all counts. The trial court rendered a judgment of conviction and sentenced the defendant to a term of four years incarceration, suspended after two years, and two years probation with special conditions including payment of $55,419.79 in restitution to the homeowners.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">The defendant appealed from the judgment of conviction to the Appellate Court. He claimed that the instruction given by the trial court<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> pursuant to \u00a7 54-84 (b) was improper because it allowed the jury to draw any inference, favorable or unfavorable, from the fact that the defendant did not tesify. Relying on <em>State </em>v. <em>Totem, </em>supra, 194 Conn. 594, the Appellate Court concluded, in a per curiam opinion, \u201cthat the [trial court\u2019s] use of \u2018unreasonable\u2019 instead of \u2018unfavorable\u2019 changes the substantive meaning of the statute and is therefore plain error,\u201d which error entitled the defendant to a new trial. <em>State </em>v. <em>Yurch, </em>31 Conn. App. 688, 690, 626 A.2d 1320 (1993). We granted the state\u2019s petition for certification.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Yurch, </em>227 Conn. 910, 632 A.2d 699 (1993). We now reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>The state claims that the Appellate Court improperly interpreted State v. <em>Tatem, </em>supra, 194 Conn. 594, as mandating automatic reversal when the word \u201cunreasonable\u201d is used in place of \u201cunfavorable\u201d in a \u00a7 54-84 (b) jury instruction. The state argues instead that <em>State </em>v. <em>Tatem, </em>supra, and its progeny establish that such an improper jury instruction constitutes plain error that may be \u201c 'harmless if, when viewed in the context of the jury charge as a whole, there is no reasonable possibility that the jury was misled. . . .\u2019\u201d Id., 599. We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">As a preliminary matter, \u201cwe note that we have repeatedly held that a claim of trial court noncompliance with \u00a7 54-84 (b) is reviewable on appeal even though a defendant, as in this case, did not at trial except to the charge as given.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Townsend, </em>206 Conn. 621, 625, 539 A.2d 114 (1988); see Practice Book \u00a7 4185. As we have previously explained, \u201cnoncompliance with \u00a7 54-84 (b) is plain error because the statute serves to effectuate the fundamental right of a defendant not to testify in his criminal trial.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Sinclair, </em>197 Conn. 574, 582, 500 A.2d 539 (1985); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Tatem, </em>supra, 194 Conn. 595.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The defendant\u2019s claim therefore was properly before the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>Whenever a defendant does not testify at trial, \u00a7 54-84 (b) requires that, \u201c[u]nless the accused requests otherwise, the court shall instruct the jury that they may draw no unfavorable inferences from the accused\u2019s failure to testify. . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Cobb, </em>199 Conn. 322, 324, 507 A.2d 457 (1986) (\u201cit was error for the trial court not to give the charge in the statutory language\u201d). In the present case, the trial court improperly departed from the statutory language. Instead, the trial court instructed the jury as follows: \u201cThe law does not compel a defendant to take the witness stand and testify, and no <em>unreasonable </em>inference may be raised, and no presumption of guilt may be drawn from the fact that a defendant decides not to testify.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The state does not challenge the conclusion of the Appellate Court that the charge did not comply with the requirements of the statute, but argues instead that in light of the entire jury charge the trial court\u2019s deviation was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Tatem, </em>supra, 194 Conn. 599-600, we declined to give talismanic effect to the use of the word \u201cunreasonable\u201d in a \u00a7 54-84 (b) jury charge. Employing a harmless error analysis, we held that \u201c \u2018[a]n erroneous instruction, even of constitutional dimension, is harmless if, viewed in the context of the charge as a whole, there is no reasonable possibility that the jury were misled. <em>State </em>v. <em>Hines, </em>187 Conn. 199, 209, 445 A.2d 314 (1982).\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Carrione, </em>[188 Conn. 681, 685, 453 A.2d 1137 (1982), cert. denied, 460 U.S. 1084, 03 S. Ct. 1775, 76 L. Ed. 2d 347 (1983)]. . . . \u2018[W]hether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>a charge is possibly misleading depends on the substance rather than the form of what is said.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Kurvin, </em>186 Conn. 555, 565, 442 A.2d 1327 (1982).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Tatem, </em>supra. Furthermore, when a statutory violation implicates the defendant\u2019s constitutional right against self-incrimination; see footnote 5; it is the state\u2019s burden to prove harmlessness beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State </em>v. <em>Sinclair, </em>supra, 197 Conn. 584.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">Because the Appellate Court failed to undertake a harmless error analysis in the present case, we now address the state\u2019s claim that the erroneous instruction was, in the context of the jury charge as a whole, harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. After applying the above principles to the jury charge as a whole, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s failure to follow the literal wording of \u00a7 54-84 (b) was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">The defendant argues, on the basis of <em>State </em>v. <em>Tatem, </em>supra, 194 Conn. 594, that the trial court\u2019s improper instruction allowed the jury to draw any inference whatsoever from the defendant\u2019s failure to testify, resulting in prejudicial error. The state argues to the contrary that the trial court\u2019s misstatement was rendered harmless by the language that immediately followed in the jury charge. Referring to the defendant\u2019s failure to testify, the trial court stated immediately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>after the erroneous language: \u201cYou must not permit such a fact to weigh in the slightest degree against the defendant. Nor should it enter your discussions or deliberations. A defendant is not required to establish his innocence. He need not produce any evidence whatsoever if he does not choose to do so. As I have told you already, the burden is on the state to prove a defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. If it fails, a defendant has the right to rely on that failure, and must be of right acquitted.\u201d The defendant concedes that this language standing alone was in substance a proper statement of the principles underlying \u00a7 54-84 (b). Nonetheless, he argues that once the erroneous language was uttered by the court, the deviation could be cured only by a specific repudiation. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">On the basis of the foregoing language, we are persuaded that it was not reasonably possible that the jury would have understood the court to be permitting any inferences whatsoever to be drawn. The language following the improper charge served to alert the jury to the fact that it was to draw no inference whatsoever from the defendant\u2019s failure to testify. It is axiomatic that \u201c[a]n instruction prohibiting any inference would also preclude an unfavorable inference.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Marra, </em>195 Conn. 421, 443, 489 A.2d 350 (1985). As a result, despite the trial court\u2019s deviation from the statutory language, \u201cthe substantive meaning of the statutory requirement was conveyed.\u201d Id. We conclude therefore that although the trial court improperly instructed the jury that it could not draw unreasonable inferences from the fact that the defendant did not testify, that misstatement was rendered harmless by the language that immediately followed, completely prohibiting the use of that fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>The judgment of the Appellate Court is reversed and the case is remanded to that court with direction to affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b539-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 54-84 provides: \u201ctestimony or silence of ACCUSED, (a) Any person on trial for crime shall be a competent witness, and at Ms or her option may testify or refuse to testify upon such trial.
