In <em>Whisper Wind Development Corp. </em>v. <em>Planning </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number><em>&amp; Zoning Commission, </em>32 Conn. App. 515, 630 A.2d 108 (1993), the Appellate Court affirmed the judgment of the trial court dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s appeal. The Appellate Court agreed with the defendant\u2019s contention that, in the case of a special permit, zoning regulations may authorize a planning and zoning commission to deny an application on the basis of enumerated general considerations such as public health, safety and welfare. Id., 519-22. We granted the plaintiff\u2019s petition for certification to appeal this question of regulatory authority.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\">After examining the record on appeal, and after considering the briefs and arguments of the parties, we conclude that the judgment of the Appellate Court must be affirmed. The issue on which we granted certification was properly resolved in the thoughtful and comprehensive majority opinion of the Appellate Court. It would serve no useful purpose for us to repeat the discussion therein contained. Cf. <em>Board of Education </em>v. <em>State Board of Education, </em>228 Conn. 433, 436, 636 A.2d 378 (1994); <em>Stankiewicz </em>v. <em>Zoning Board Of Appeals, </em>211 Conn. 76, 78, 556 A.2d 1024 (1989); <em>State </em>v. <em>Leonard, </em>210 Conn. 480, 481, 556 A.2d 611 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b199-6\"> We granted the plaintiffs petition for certification to appeal limited to the following issue: \u201cWas the Appellate Court correct in concluding that the trial court properly determined that the plaintiff's failure to meet the general health, safety and welfare requirements set forth in the town\u2019s zoning regulations provided an adequate basis for the defendant\u2019s denial of a special permit application, even though the plaintiff\u2019s application complied with all of the technical requirements of the regulations applicable to special permits?\u201d <em>Whisper Wind Development Corp. </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>227 Conn. 929, 632 A.2d 706 (1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
