We conclude that the substantial compliance test is the proper standard by which to review the hospital\u2019s compliance with the bylaws, and therefore affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-8\">The following undisputed facts are relevant to this appeal. The plaintiff, Guy Owens, is a neurosurgeon who enjoyed surgical privileges at the defendant, New Britain General Hospital (hospital), for several years prior to the events leading up to the hospital\u2019s decision not to reappoint him to its medical staff. In 1982, the hospital\u2019s chief of surgery, Gerald O. Strauch, appointed two outside neurosurgeons, William F. Collins, Jr., and Edward B. Schlesinger, to conduct a review of the entire neurosurgery section of the hospital. At the conclusion of their review, Collins and Schlesinger issued a report (Collins-Schlesinger report) that summarized their findings and concluded, inter alia, that the plaintiff inappropriately and unjustifiably had been performing disc surgery. The Collins-Schlesinger report recommended that the plaintiff obtain second opinions in all future cases of disc sur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>gery and that the plaintiff refer certain patients for psychiatric consultations before performing particular surgical procedures. The Collins-Schlesinger report also recommended that an outside review of the neurological section be conducted on a monthly basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">In response to the conclusions and recommendations contained in the Collins-Schlesinger report, Strauch implemented a set of measures (Strauch measures) with which the plaintiff, in writing, voluntarily agreed to comply. Pursuant to one of the Strauch measures, the plaintiff agreed to obtain second opinions for disc surgery and psychiatric consultations for patients who were to undergo certain other procedures. In accordance with a second Strauch measure, the hospital established a monthly review of the neurosurgery section, and charged Richard Simon, a neurosurgeon at the University of Connecticut Health Center, with its implementation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">Subsequently, the plaintiff informed Strauch that he would no longer adhere to the Strauch measure requiring him to obtain second opinions and psychiatric consultations. Thereafter, in December, 1984, Simon rendered a lengthy report (Simon report) containing a review of the plaintiff\u2019s compliance with the Strauch measures, as well as statistical data concerning the operative procedures performed by the plaintiff. The Simon report severely criticized the plaintiff\u2019s surgical practices<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and concluded that the plaintiff had not complied with the Strauch measure requiring second opinions and consultations.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>In February, 1985, Strauch furnished the plaintiff with the Simon report and advised him to prepare a written response.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On receipt of the plaintiffs response, Strauch filed with the hospital staff executive committee (executive committee), in accordance with article VII, \u00a7 1 (a) of the medical staff bylaws,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> a formal recommendation for corrective action against the plaintiff.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Subsequently, Strauch appointed a three person ad hoc committee, chaired by physician William Waskowitz, (Waskowitz committee) to consider Strauch\u2019s recommendation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>On October 18, 1985, after six meetings, the Waskowitz committee filed its report with the executive committee, recommending that the executive committee implement Strauch\u2019s recommendation for corrective action. In a follow-up report dated October 28,1985, the Waskowitz committee stated that, in formulating its recommendation, it had relied on the Collins-Schlesinger report, the Simon report and thirty-five other records of the plaintiff\u2019s patients, selected by Strauch for the Waskowitz committee\u2019s review. The Waskowitz committee further stated that it had reached the following conclusions: \u201c1. In spite of agreeing in writing to do so, [the plaintiff] failed in most cases to obtain either neurosurgical, neurological or orthopedic second opinions or indicated psychiatric consultations\u201d; and <em>\u201c2. </em>In most of the charts reviewed [the plaintiff] performed surgical procedures that were unjustifiable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">Subsequently, by letter dated October 29, 1985, George H. Bray, the hospital\u2019s chief of staff and chair of the executive committee, informed the plaintiff that the executive committee had convened to consider both Strauch\u2019s recommendation for corrective action and the Waskowitz committee\u2019s report. In the same letter, Bray invited the plaintiff to appear informally before the executive committee on November 15, 1985, for the purpose of discussing his surgical practice.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Bray also advised the plaintiff that, because the executive corn<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>mittee had voted unanimously to require him to obtain corroborative second opinions in cases involving surgery,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> he was strongly advised to abide by the Strauch measures pending the resolution of his case. The plaintiff thereafter agreed in writing to comply with the executive committee\u2019s requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">At the executive committee\u2019s November 15 meeting, the plaintiff addressed the executive committee, criticized both the Collins-Schlesinger and Simon reports, and presented statements from consulting experts he had retained. Following that meeting, the executive committee recommended the imposition of various restrictions on the plaintiff\u2019s clinical and surgical privileges. The plaintiff appealed from the executive committee\u2019s recommendation, thereby staying the effect of the restrictions.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>In response to the plaintiffs appeal, a second ad hoc committee, chaired by Thomas J. Devers (Devers committee), was appointed to hold a hearing.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In April, 1986, after completing the formal hearing process, the Devers committee recommended confirmation of the executive committee\u2019s recommendation to impose restrictions on the plaintiff\u2019s practice,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and the plaintiff appealed from that decision to the hospital board of directors.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">In May, 1986, while that appeal was pending, Bray informed the plaintiff that another neurosurgeon on the hospital staff, Ali Nourizadeh, had written a letter to the executive committee raising several serious <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>charges against the plaintiff.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> On June 9, 1986, the executive committee held a special meeting, at which the plaintiff was present, to consider the charges.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Following that meeting, by letter dated June 10, 1986, the plaintiff was notified that, pursuant to article V, \u00a7 3 (b) of the medical staff bylaws,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> the executive committee had voted to recommend that he not be reappointed.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Subsequently, the plaintiff appealed from the executive committee\u2019s recommendation.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">While that appeal was pending, in late June, 1986, the plaintiff withdrew his appeal from the Devers committee\u2019s confirmation of the executive committee\u2019s recommendation to impose restrictions on his prac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>tice,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> thereby triggering the immediate implementation of the restrictions. A three member committee subsequently began monitoring the plaintiffs practice for compliance with the restrictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">Concurrently, in response to the plaintiffs appeal from the executive committee\u2019s recommendation not to reappoint him to the medical staff, another ad hoc committee was formed, chaired by Martin Dinep (Dinep committee).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> After a series of hearings, the Dinep committee released its report, dated October 15, 1986, in which it unanimously upheld the executive committee\u2019s decision not to recommend the plaintiff\u2019s reappointment.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Subsequently, the executive committee accepted the Dinep committee\u2019s report and the plaintiff appealed to the board of directors.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">An appellate review committee, composed of members of the board of directors, chaired by Anthony A. Cooper (Cooper committee), was formed to review the Dinep committee\u2019s conclusions. On January 20, 1987, after three evidentiary hearings and two sessions of deliberations, the Cooper committee concluded that the executive committee\u2019s recommendation not to reappoint the plaintiff was supported by the record. Consequently, the Cooper committee unanimously recommended that the board of directors confirm the executive committee\u2019s recommendation not to reappoint the plaintiff. On February 19,1987, the hospital officially notified the plaintiff that the board of directors had voted to terminate his medical staff privileges.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>The plaintiff initiated this action against the hospital, seeking money damages for breach of contract and negligent infliction of emotional distress, as well as injunctive relief in the form of reinstatement of his staff privileges. After the trial court rendered judgment for the hospital, the plaintiff appealed to the Appellate Court, claiming, inter alia, that the trial court improperly applied a test of substantial compliance in determining whether, in the course of terminating his staff privileges, the hospital had complied with the bylaw obligations to him.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> On appeal, the Appellate Court affirmed the judgment of the trial court, concluding, inter alia, that: (1) the test of substantial compliance is the proper standard by which to measure the hospital\u2019s performance under the bylaws; and (2) the hospital had not breached the bylaws by failing to renew the plaintiff\u2019s medical staff privileges. <em>Owens </em>v. <em>New Britain General Hospital, </em>32 Conn. App. 56, 58, 627 A.2d 1373 (1993). We granted the plaintiff\u2019s petition for certification limited to the following issue: \u201cWhether the Appellate Court correctly held that the defendant hospital need only substantially comply with its [medical staff] bylaws when terminating a physician\u2019s medical staff privileges and whether the failure to renew the plaintiff\u2019s medical staff privileges constituted a breach of those medical staff bylaws?\u201d <em>Owens </em>v. <em>New Britain General Hospital, </em>227 Conn. 923, 632 A.2d 701 (1993). We now affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">The plaintiff first claims that the Appellate Court improperly concluded that the trial court had correctly applied a \u201csubstantial\u201d rather than \u201cstrict\u201d compliance test<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> in assessing whether the hospital had sufficiently complied with the medical staff bylaw obligations to the plaintiff in the course of terminating his medical staff privileges, because the substantial compliance test does not adequately protect the public or physicians.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">In <em>Gianetti </em>v. <em>Norwalk Hospital, </em>211 Conn. 51, 59, 62, 557 A.2d 1249 (1989), we held that although the medical staff bylaws of the Norwalk Hospital did not constitute an enforceable contract per se between the hospital and the plaintiff as a member of the hospital medical staff, administrative decisions by the hospital affecting the plaintiffs rights as a medical staff mem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>ber under the bylaws were nevertheless subject to judicial review.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> In the present case, the parties do not dispute that the hospital, a private nonprofit corporation,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> was bound by its own bylaws in deciding to revoke the plaintiffs medical staff privileges. Additionally, the parties agree that such an administrative decision of the hospital is subject to some form of judicial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>review. The parties disagree, however, as to the proper test of compliance\u2014an issue we did not reach in <em>Gianetti </em>v. <em>Norwalk Hospital, </em>supra, 211 Conn. 51. We resolve this issue in favor of the hospital and conclude that a substantial compliance test as adopted by the Appellate Court is the proper test by which to measure whether a hospital has sufficiently complied with its bylaws in terminating a physician\u2019s medical staff privileges.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">We arrive at this conclusion in appreciation of the overarching function that medical staff bylaws are designed to serve\u2014the provision of quality medical care to the surrounding public community. <em>See Davis </em>v. <em>Morristown Memorial Hospital, </em>106 N.J. Super. 33, 43, 254 A.2d 125 (1969) (in adopting medical staff bylaws, hospital should consider whether particular provision promotes \u201c \u2018sound hospital standards\u2019 in \u2018faithfully furnishing facilities to the members of the medical profession in aid of their service to the public\u2019 \u201d). Medical staff bylaws reflect what the medical community considers to be crucial to the effective administration of the hospital and the provision of quality medical care by physicians whose performance has earned them privileges. At the same time, the procedural protocol of the bylaws \u201cprovide, outside of the judicial system, a fair method for making decisions concerning staff privileges.\u201d <em>Nanavati </em>v. <em>Burdette Tomlin Memorial Hospital, </em>107 N.J. 240, 251, 526 A.2d 697 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">We therefore recognize that the obligation to follow medical staff bylaws is paramount and that a hospital must afford its medical staff all the process and protections encompassed by its bylaws. See, e.g., <em>Shulman </em>v. <em>Washington Hospital Center, </em>222 F. Sup. 59, 64 (D.D.C. 1963); <em>Scappatura v. Baptist Hospital of Phoenix, </em>120 Ariz. 204, 208, 584 P.2d 1195 (1978); <em>Berberian </em>v. <em>Lancaster Osteopathic Hospital Assn., </em>395 Pa. 257, 263-64, 149 A.2d 456 (1959). A hospital\u2019s obligation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>to follow bylaws can stem from a contractual relationship between the hospital and the physician. <em>Berberian </em>v. <em>Lancaster Osteopathic Hospital Assn., </em>supra, 263. It can also be based on a preexisting legal duty imposed by our state department of health regulations to adopt \u201c \u2018bylaws, rules and regulations, including medical staff bylaws.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gianetti </em>v. <em>Norwalk Hospital, </em>supra, 211 Conn. 59 (legal duty to adopt medical staff bylaws under \u00a7 19-13-D3 [b] [1] [A] of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies, \u201ca fortiori, imposes a legal duty upon the Norwalk Hospital to abide by such bylaws\u201d). The obligation can also stem from the recognition of a \u201cfiduciary concept.\u201d <em>Greisman </em>v. <em>Newcomb Hospital, </em>40 N.J. 389, 404, 192 A.2d 817 (1963) (\u201c[hospital officials] must recognize that their powers, particularly those relating to the selection of staff members, are powers in trust which are always to be dealt with as such\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">A hospital\u2019s obligation to follow its bylaws also arises from the public\u2019s substantial interest in the operation of hospitals, public or private. \u201cHospitals exist to provide health care to the public. In addition to serving the needs of their patients, hospitals also provide a place of employment for doctors and other professionals. The privilege to admit and treat patients at a hospital can be critical to a doctor\u2019s ability to practice his [or her] profession and to treat patients. Both doctors and patients can suffer if otherwise qualified doctors are wrongly denied staff privileges.\u201d <em>Nanavati </em>v. <em>Burdette Tomlin Memorial Hospital, </em>supra, 107 N.J. 248. Consequently, hospitals must treat physicians fairly in making decisions about their privileges because patients need physicians and they, in turn, need hospital privileges to serve their patients. Therefore, in establishing standards for granting or maintaining staff appointment or clinical privileges, hospitals must ensure that these standards are rationally related to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>the delivery of quality health care to patients. Id., 249. The public has an interest that staff decisions are not made arbitrarily. By requiring hospitals to adhere to their bylaws, the risk of arbitrary decisions is reduced. <em>Balkissoon </em>v. <em>Capitol Hill Hospital, </em>558 A.2d 304, 308 (D.C. App. 1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">There must also be concern, however, for unnecessary judicial interference with those whose duty it is to make the decisions and who have the necessary expertise with which to act. Courts are generally unwilling \u201cto substitute their judgment on the merits for the professional judgment of medical and hospital officials with superior qualifications to make such decisions.\u201d <em>Mahmoodian </em>v. <em>United Hospital Center, Inc., </em>185 W. Va. 59, 65, 404 S.E.2d 750, cert. denied, 502 U.S. 863, 112 S. Ct. 185, 116 L. Ed. 2d 146 (1991). \u201cIn so specialized and sensitive an activity as governing a hospital, courts are well advised to defer to those with the duty to govern.\u201d <em>Nanavati </em>v. <em>Burdette Tomlin Memorial Hospital, </em>supra, 107 N.J. 251. Although a hospital is bound by its bylaws, judicial review of a hospital board\u2019s decision to suspend a physician\u2019s privileges focuses on the reasonableness of the action taken in relation to the interests of the parties and the public. <em>Garrow </em>v. <em>Elizabeth General Hospital &amp; Dispensary, </em>79 N.J. 549, 565, 401 A.2d 533 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">The special nature of the proceedings involved in matters relating to determinations of the professional competence and capability of a physician to practice medicine in a hospital setting prompted the Appellate Court to conclude that decisions concerning whether a physician is entitled to staff privileges should be left to the expertise of the hospital\u2019s staff and administration. The exercise of their discretion should be subject only to limited judicial surveillance to determine if the hospital substantially complied with its applicable bylaw <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>procedures.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> This conclusion is consistent with the position held by the majority of the jurisdictions. By relying on breach of contract principles, these courts have applied a limited scope of judicial review to ensure that the hospital had substantially complied with its bylaws and to ensure that those bylaws provided basic notice and fair hearing procedures, including an impar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>tial tribunal.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>Shulman </em>v. <em>Washington Hospital Center, </em>supra, 222 F. Sup. 63, 64; <em>Eidelson </em>v. <em>Archer, </em>645 P.2d 171, 175 n.13 (Alaska 1982) (citing cases from other jurisdictions); <em>Gaenslen </em>v. <em>Board of Directors, </em>185 Cal. App. 3d 563, 568, 232 Cal. Rptr. 239 (1985); <em>Adkins </em>v. <em>Sarah Bush Lincoln Health Center, </em>129 Ill. 2d 497, 506-507, 509-10, 514, 544 N.E.2d 733 (1989); <em>Pepple </em>v. <em>Parkview Memorial Hospital, Inc., </em>536 N.E.2d 274, 276 (Ind. 1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">Against this backdrop of competing interests, we conclude that the substantial compliance test ensures procedural fairness to the physician while preserving decisions concerning staff privileges for the expert judgment of hospital officials.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">Having concluded that the substantial compliance test is the proper standard by which to measure whether the hospital sufficiently complied with its medical staff bylaws in terminating the plaintiffs medical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>staff privileges, we turn to the application of that test to the facts of this case. The plaintiff argues that the Appellate Court improperly sustained the trial court\u2019s findings that the hospital had not breached the bylaw obligations to provide him with: (1) notice of and an opportunity to respond to the cases that formed the basis of the Collins-Schlesinger report; (2) an opportunity during the Cooper committee hearing to present evidence of his compliance with the restrictions on his privileges; and (3) generally fair procedures. We reject each of the plaintiff\u2019s claims and conclude, consistent with the Appellate Court\u2019s decision, that the trial court correctly determined that the hospital had substantially complied with the bylaws.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">Each of the plaintiffs claims presents a challenge to the factual findings and conclusions of the trial court with respect to the hospital\u2019s procedural compliance with the bylaws. We therefore begin, as the Appellate Court did, by setting forth the appropriate standard of our judicial review. We have long held that \u201cwhere the factual basis of the court\u2019s decision is challenged we must determine whether the facts set out in the memorandum of decision are supported by the evidence or whether, in light of the evidence and the pleadings in the whole record, those facts are clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Pandolphe\u2019s Auto Parts, Inc. </em>v. <em>Manchester, </em>181 Conn. 217, 221-22, 435 A.2d 24 (1980). \u201cA finding of fact is clearly erroneous when there is no evidence in the record to support it ... or when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Crowell </em>v. <em>Danforth, </em>222 Conn. 150, 156, 609 A.2d 654 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>1</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">The plaintiff first argues that the trial court improperly determined that the hospital did not breach its obligation under the medical staff bylaws to provide him with adequate notice and a sufficient opportunity to defend himself. Specifically, the plaintiff argues that prior to his hearing before the Devers committee, he was entitled under the notice provisions of the bylaws<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> to a list of the patient charts supporting the Collins-Schlesinger report\u2019s claim of unnecessary surgery. In the absence of such a list, the plaintiff contends he was powerless to defend himself against the report\u2019s adverse conclusions. In support of his arguments, the plaintiff focuses on two of the hospital\u2019s uses of the Collins-Schlesinger report. First, the plaintiff asserts that the Devers committee used the substantive conclusions in the report as a basis for confirming the executive committee\u2019s recommendation to impose restrictions on his privileges. Second, the plaintiff asserts that the Dinep committee relied on his noncompliance with the Strauch measures, which implemented the Collins-Schlesinger report, as a ground for not reappointing him to the medical staff. We reject the plaintiff\u2019s arguments and conclude that the hospital did not violate the \u201cnotice\u201d and \u201copportunity to respond\u201d provisions of the bylaws through either use of the Collins-Schlesinger report.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>As already stated, the plaintiff voluntarily withdrew his appeal from the decision of the Devers committee confirming the executive committee\u2019s recommendation to impose restrictions on his privileges. On withdrawing his appeal, the plaintiff admitted his understanding that, pursuant to the bylaws, the executive committee\u2019s recommendation for restrictions would be forwarded for approval by the board of directors and that the recommendation was likely to be formally imposed by the board of directors.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Article VIII, \u00a7 3 (d) of the medical staff bylaws provides in part: \u201cThe failure of a practitioner to request . . . review to which he is entitled by these bylaws within the time and in the manner provided for herein shall be deemed a waiver of his right to such . . . appellate review . . . with respect to the matter. When the hearing or appellate review waived relates to a recommendation of the staff executive committee . . . the recommendation shall become and remain effective against the practitioner pending the board of directors\u2019 decision on the matter.\u201d Under these bylaw provisions, by virtue of withdrawing his appeal from the Devers committee\u2019s confirmation of the executive committee\u2019s recommendation to impose restrictions on his practice, the plaintiff waived his right to any further appeal from that recommendation. Accordingly, we conclude that the plaintiff is now precluded from raising any claims concerning the propriety of the Devers committee\u2019s use of the Collins-Schlesinger report.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">We also conclude that the Dinep committee\u2019s use of the Collins-Schlesinger report did not deprive the plaintiff of notice of or an opportunity to defend himself against the cases that formed the basis of the report. In their report, Collins and Schlesinger state that their review consisted of, inter alia, an evaluation of: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>(1) approximately sixty charts, randomly selected from neurosurgical admissions between October, 1980, and September, 1982; (2) the dossiers of the three attending neurosurgeons in the section at the time; and (3) a computer printout of the cases admitted to the neurosurgical section of the hospital between October 1, 1980, and March 13,1982. The defendant asserts, and the plaintiff does not contest, that the plaintiff had been furnished with a copy of the report, prior to agreeing voluntarily to comply with the Strauch measures. Moreover, before the report was released, the plaintiff met with Collins and Schlesinger to discuss their review of his files and of the neurosurgical section in general. In light of these circumstances, we are persuaded that the plaintiff received adequate notice of the time frame and parameters of the Collins-Schlesinger review and had an opportunity to apprise himself of some, if not all, of the cases that formed the basis for the report\u2019s critical conclusions. By so providing the plaintiff with notice and an opportunity to defend himself, we conclude that the hospital sufficiently complied with the bylaws under the substantial compliance test. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court properly determined that the plaintiff had ample notice of and an opportunity to respond to the issues considered by the Dinep committee concerning the Collins-Schlesinger report.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">The plaintiff also argues that the hospital\u2019s reliance on his failure to abide by the Strauch measures as a ground for not recommending his reappointment was improper because Strauch lacked the authority under the bylaws to impose unilaterally the Strauch measures without resort to the review procedures set forth in articles VII and VIII of the bylaws. The plaintiff argues that when he withdrew his voluntary adherence to the measures, Strauch should have taken immediate action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>to impose the Strauch measures as restrictions on his privileges under the bylaws. The plaintiff contends that in failing to do so, the hospital improperly terminated his medical staff privileges on the basis of his failure to abide by the Strauch measures, after having taken no timely steps to render the measures enforceable against him. We reject this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">Despite the plaintiffs claim to the contrary, Strauch timely took appropriate action under the bylaws to impose the Strauch measures as restrictions on the plaintiffs medical practice. The plaintiff does not contest that Strauch had the authority in the first instance to order the Collins-Schlesinger review of the neurosurgical section. On the basis of that review, Collins and Schlesinger concluded that the plaintiff had been performing unnecessary surgery. When the plaintiff failed voluntarily to rectify his deficient medical practices, Strauch ultimately sought corrective action under article VII of the bylaws. The plaintiff has not indicated and we do not find any provision of article VII indicating the time frame within which Strauch had to request such corrective action. In fact, article VII, \u00a7 1 (a) authorizes Strauch to request corrective action <em>\u201c[w]henever </em>the activities or professional conduct of any practitioner with clinical privileges are considered to be lower than the standards or aims of the medical staff or to be disruptive to the operations of the hospital . . . (Emphasis added.) Strauch waited as long as he did to seek corrective action against the plaintiff because he initially afforded the plaintiff the chance to conform to proper medical procedures and safeguards voluntarily. We decline to penalize the hospital for these efforts and conclude that Strauch timely took action to impose the Strauch measures as restrictions on the plaintiffs privileges.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">We also conclude that the hospital did not \u201cpunish\u201d the plaintiff for his failure to abide by the Strauch mea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>sures before they had been officially enforced. As stated, the Strauch measures were implemented in response to the Collins-Schlesinger report\u2019s very serious conclusion that the plaintiff had been performing unnecessary surgeries. The measures, therefore, were designed to prevent future unnecessary surgeries and to realize the requisite level of quality medical care within the neurosurgery section of the hospital. When it imposed Strauch\u2019s request for corrective action, the hospital did not rely on the fact that the plaintiff had withdrawn his earlier agreement to comply with the Strauch measures. Rather, the hospital took adverse action against the plaintiff because, on the basis of the initial conclusion of the Collins-Schlesinger report and the independent conclusion of the Simon report, he had been performing and was <em>continuing to </em>perform unnecessary surgeries.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">Moreover, when the executive committee, the Dinep committee and the Cooper committee each considered the hospital\u2019s decision not to recommend the plaintiff\u2019s reappointment, the Strauch measures had long been imposed as restrictions on the plaintiff\u2019s practice. Once it had ratified the Strauch measures as restrictions, the hospital focused on the plaintiff\u2019s <em>continued </em>failure to adhere to those restrictions, not on his earlier refusal to comport with the Strauch measures. Therefore, we conclude that the hospital properly terminated the plaintiff\u2019s medical staff privileges and did not incorrectly rely on his failure to comply voluntarily with the Strauch measures prior to their enforcement through the bylaws.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b637-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">The plaintiff next claims that the trial court improperly found that the hospital substantially complied with its bylaws because it denied him an opportunity during the Cooper committee hearing adequately to rebut evidence of his noncompliance with the restrictions on his privileges in connection to specific cases that he alleges were first brought to his attention at the appellate review level. The following additional facts are necessary to the disposition of this claim. During the Cooper committee appellate review process, the executive committee, represented by Antoinette Capriglione, a staff physician, referred to several specific case examples demonstrating the plaintiff\u2019s alleged failure to comport with his practice restrictions. The plaintiff protested the inclusion of the cases, claiming that he had been unaware that his compliance with the practice restrictions was in question with respect to the cases and that in any event, he had never been afforded the opportunity to refute the allegations of noncompliance. Thereafter, on his request, the plaintiff was presented with a list of the cases approximately one week prior to the final Cooper committee hearing. At that hearing, the Cooper committee permitted the plaintiff to discuss the cases and to make oral reference to specific charts in the cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">Notwithstanding his ability to discuss the cases, the plaintiff claims that the Cooper committee violated the bylaws by its refusal: (1) to permit him to present objective evidence of the existence of required second opinions and consultations in the actual medical charts at the final hearing; or (2) to remand the issue of his compliance back to the fact-finding level to hear such evidence. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>The Appellate Court directly addressed this claim and concluded that the Cooper committee did not violate the bylaws. The Appellate Court noted that \u00a7 6 (g) of the \u201cProtocol for Conduct of Hearings and Appellate Reviews,\u201d promulgated pursuant to article VIII, \u00a7 4 of the medical staff bylaws, provides that it is within the Cooper committee\u2019s discretion to consider, \u201cunder unusual circumstances,\u201d \u201c \u2018[n]ew or additional matters not raised or presented during the original hearing or in the hearing committee and not otherwise reflected in the record of proceedings . . . \u201d <em>Owens </em>v. <em>New Britain General Hospital, </em>supra, 32 Conn. App. 82. The Appellate Court reasoned that, although this bylaw provision authorized the Cooper committee to have considered new case examples of the plaintiff\u2019s noncompliance, it nevertheless did not rely on that evidence as a basis for its decision to affirm the executive committee\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">Our exhaustive review of the record supports this conclusion.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> The Cooper committee report directly addressed its decision not to consider evidence of the plaintiff\u2019s compliance with the restrictions on his practice, which he had accepted when he withdrew his appeal from the Devers committee decision after the executive committee\u2019s June 9, 1986 decision not to recommend his reappointment. The Cooper committee report stated: \u201c[The plaintiff requested that . . . Bray describe events relating to [the] supervision of [the plaintiff\u2019s] practice <em>since </em>the [executive committee\u2019s] decision of June 9,1986. [This committee] determined that its purpose was to review the June 9th decision and matters leading up to it [and] not to inves<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>tigate subsequent events.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The report further stated: \u201c[The plaintiffs] attorney claimed that the [executive committee] violated [the plaintiffs] rights by basing its June 9th decision upon cases which had not been discussed with [the plaintiff]. [This committee] concluded in deliberations, based upon consideration of the overall record and statements made during . . . sessions by ... Bray and Capriglione, that two or three specific matters within the few weeks prior to the June 9th decision did not play a significant part in the [executive committee\u2019s] decision and that the process was therefore not unfair to [the plaintiff] in that regard.\u201d These passages persuade us that the Appellate Court correctly determined that the Cooper committee did not violate the bylaws.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">Even if the Cooper committee had relied on the case examples as a basis for its decision to affirm the executive committee\u2019s decision, we conclude that, in so doing, it operated within its discretion under the bylaws because the plaintiff had sufficient notice, and an opportunity to present evidence in defense of those cases. It is undisputed that, at his own request, the plaintiff received a list of the cases prior to the final Cooper committee hearing. It is also undisputed that the plaintiff was afforded an opportunity to discuss the cases and to refer orally to the medical charts at the final Cooper committee hearing. Moreover, despite his claim to the contrary, the plaintiff points to no authority precluding him from actually bringing in with him the medical charts to the hearing.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>We conclude, in accordance with the Appellate Court, that the trial court properly determined that to the extent the hospital considered any new material, \u201cextra care was taken on [its] part . . . to conduct additional sessions to incorporate the new material so as to fairly put the plaintiff on notice and to permit him to respond adequately.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">The plaintiffs final claim is that the trial court improperly concluded that the \u201ccumulative effect\u201d of the hospital\u2019s deviations from the bylaws did not deprive him of fundamentally fair process. As the Appellate Court determined, \u201c[t]his claim merely reiterates all of the issues raised in the [plaintiffs] two previous claims . . . .\u201d <em>Owens </em>v. <em>New Britain General Hospital, </em>supra, 32 Conn. App. 83-84. Because we have concluded that the trial court properly determined that the hospital substantially complied with the bylaw obligations to provide the plaintiff with adequate notice of and an opportunity to respond to the charges against him, we need not address this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-8\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b616-7\"> A third Strauch measure, banning surgery for intracranial aneurysms, is not relevant to this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b616-8\"> The Simon report stated in part: \u201c[T]he statistics presented above indicated variance with acceptable standards of practice for lumbar surgery regarding patient selection, age of patient recurrence rates, infection rates and variance from some, but not all series regarding multiple simultaneous recurrence rates.

Accordingly, we reasoned that the hospital\u2019s agreement with the plaintiff to abide by the bylaws, in and of itself, did not constitute valid consideration to support an enforceable contract. Id. After looking beyond the bylaws themselves, however, we concluded that a contractual relationship existed between the hospital and the plaintiff. Id., 62-63. Specifically, we stated that the hospital\u2019s extension of medical staff privileges to the physician, in return for his agreement to abide by the medical staff bylaws, established the contractual mutuality, supported by valid consideration, necessary to support an enforceable contract. Id., 63. We further stated that these undertakings of the plaintiff and the hospital, coupled with the hospital\u2019s duty to obey its bylaws, rendered the bylaws \u201c \u2018an enforceable <em>part </em>of the contract\u2019 \u201d between the hospital and the plaintiff.

We were thus not called upon in <em>Gianetti </em>to decide whether, in the absence of such a contract, a private hospital\u2019s decision to deny or suspend a physician\u2019s staff privileges would be immune from judicial review. In the present case, we likewise leave that issue for another day.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b629-6\"> Prompted by these same concerns, courts have analogized the decisions of hospitals concerning staff privileges to decisions made by administrative agencies.

App. 790, 793-95, 440 N.W.2d 80, cert. denied, 433 Mich. 919 (1989) (no judicial review of private hospital\u2019s decision to terminate medical staff privileges, not even to ensure compliance with medical staff bylaws\u2019 methods for reaching that decision); <em>Medical Center Hospitals </em>v. <em>Terzis, </em>235 Va. 443, 445-46, 367 S.E.2d 728 (1988) (statute on judicial review of hospitals\u2019 decisions adversely affecting existing medical staff members\u2019 privileges does not authorize judicial review of procedures employed by hospitals in reaching such decisions, provided hospitals\u2019 decisions are in writing and are based on certain statutorily permitted reasons).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-10\">Neither party has pointed to, nor has our research disclosed, any jurisdiction that provides for anything greater than substantial compliance with applicable bylaws.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b632-6\"> The plaintiff specifically relies on \u00a7 2 of the \u201cProtocol for Conduct of Hearings and Appellate Reviews,\u201d promulgated pursuant to article VIII, \u00a7 4 of the medical staff bylaws, which states in relevant part: <em>\u201cNotice of Hearing. </em>The chief executive officer shall notify an affected practitioner . . . that a hearing has been scheduled in response to the practitioner\u2019s request. The notice shall be in writing and shall <em>contain a concise statement of the acts or omissions with which the practitioner has been charged, a list of charts being questioned, or other reasons for an adverse recommendation or action. . . .\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b633-6\"> Neither party disputes that the board of directors formally imposed the executive committee\u2019s recommendation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b636-6\"> The plaintiff argues that, in disposing of this claim, the Appellate Court improperly concluded that by virtue of the plaintiff\u2019s earlier agreement to comply with the Strauch measures, he had waived his right to claim any breach of the bylaws resulting from the imposition of those measures. Because we resolve the plaintiff\u2019s claim on different grounds, we need not address this argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b638-6\"> Although the Appellate Court\u2019s analysis of the plaintiff\u2019s claim focuses only on the propriety of the Cooper committee\u2019s consideration of case examples evidencing the plaintiff\u2019s noncompliance <em>after </em>June 9,1986, both <em>our </em>interpretation of the plaintiff\u2019s claim and our review of the record has persuaded us to analyze the propriety of the Cooper committee\u2019s consideration of such case examples arising both prior to and after June 9, 1986.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b639-6\"> In fact, the plaintiff requested the cases for the express purpose of being afforded the opportunity to bring in \u201call the documentation ... to show that, in fact, [he] had complied with everything.\u201d The plaintiff therefore, by his own admission, had an opportunity to review the patient charts for evidence of his compliance with the restrictions and to bring with him copies of the patient charts to the final Cooper committee hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
