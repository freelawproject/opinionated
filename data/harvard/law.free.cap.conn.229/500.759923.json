The jury, in finding the issue of liability in favor of the plaintiff, also found that the damages sustained by the plaintiff totaled $136,050, and that those damages were to be reduced by 25 percent as a result of the plaintiffs comparative responsibility. The trial court accordingly reduced the plaintiffs award, and rendered judgment for the plaintiff in the amount of $102,037.50. After the trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion to set aside the verdict,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the defendant appealed to the Appellate Court. The Appellate Court affirmed the trial court\u2019s judgment; <em>Elliot </em>v. <em>Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>30 Conn. App. 664, 621 A.2d 1371 (1993); and we granted the defendant\u2019s petition for certification.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Although we affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court, we base our decision on an analysis of the statutory language not relied upon by that court.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>The jury could reasonably have found the following facts. In April, 1987, the plaintiff and his wife, with the assistance of a contractor, were adding a full second floor to their A-frame house in Waterford. As a means of access to the new floor under construction, they borrowed a sixteen foot aluminum extension ladder, constructed with rounded rungs, belonging to the plaintiffs father-in-law. The ladder had been purchased from the defendant in 1985.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">The plaintiff set up the ladder in the following manner. The base of the ladder was secured against a board that was nailed into the floor framing. The \u201cfly\u201d of the ladder, the moving part which extends its length, was extended one or two feet and tied to a two-by-four affixed to a partition on the second floor. The plaintiff set up the ladder in this manner so that it would not move or slip during use. The ladder was set at approximately a sixty degree angle, so that it would function as a staircase. At the top of the fly of the ladder, there was a sharp metal edge that was exposed when the ladder was extended. The plaintiff had not noticed this exposed edge prior to his injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">The plaintiff often descended the ladder with his back to the rungs. A label on the ladder warned users \u201calways [to] face ladder when climbing, working or descending.\u201d The label also contained the warning that users should always maintain a firm grip on the ladder. The plaintiff had not read any of the labels on the ladder prior to his accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">On April 17, 1987, the plaintiff was visited by a friend. They each climbed the ladder to the second floor so the plaintiff could show him the progress made on the addition. After fifteen to twenty minutes, the telephone, which was located in the kitchen on the first floor, rang. In order to answer the telephone, the plaintiff descended the ladder, with his back to it, and about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>half way down he lost his balance and slipped.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As he fell, he reached out with his left hand to grab something to steady himself. He was wearing his wedding ring on his left hand ring finger. As he attempted to break his fall, the ring snagged on the exposed sharp metal edge at the top of the extension ladder. This caused the plaintiff to suffer a degloving injury to the finger, leaving him with an exposed bone and tendon without any skin or soft tissue. His finger was eventually amputated.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">Eric Jordan, an associate professor of mechanical engineering at the University of Connecticut, testified as an expert witness for the plaintiff. Jordan testified that it is generally recognized that metal ladders should include end caps and end closures or equivalent protection against sharp edges and snagging. He testified that although the ladder did include end caps, there was an exposed sharp upper edge of the ladder that was not capped. In his opinion, this presented a significant hazard of snagging, and therefore the end caps included with the ladder did not \u201cfulfill the intended purpose of the end cap with regards to preventing snagging and sharp edge injury.\u201d In Jordan\u2019s opinion, the ladder was unreasonably dangerous due to the defectively designed end caps. Jordan also testified that the top of the ladder could have been fully capped without impairing the function of the ladder and without incurring a significant cost. Finally, he testified that although it is a misuse of the ladder to descend with one\u2019s back to the ladder, it is a common and foreseeable misuse that could reasonably be anticipated by the seller.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">In adopting the act, the legislature intended to incorporate in a single cause of action an exclusive remedy for all claims falling within its scope. <em>Winslow </em>v. <em>Lewis-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number><em>Shepard, Inc., </em>212 Conn. 462, 471, 562 A.2d 517 (1989). In doing so, \u201cthe legislature was merely recasting an existing cause of action and was not creating a wholly new right for claimants harmed by a product. The intent of the legislature was to eliminate the complex pleading provided at common law. . . . 22 S. Proc., Pt. 14, 1979 Sess., pp. 4637-38; 22 H.R. Proc., Pt. 20, 1979 Sess., pp. 7021-22.\u201d <em>Lynn v. Haybuster Mfg., Inc., </em>226 Conn. 282, 292, 627 A.2d 1288 (1993). The act, however, is no model of clarity; an example is its ambiguous treatment of the defense of misuse that has resulted in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">One point of confusion regarding the act, as demonstrated by the briefs of the parties before us and by members of the bar,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> is the belief that it was patterned after the Model Uniform Product Liability Act (model act), 44 Fed. Reg. 62714-50 (1979), recommended by the United States Department of Commerce on October 31, 1979. As we have previously stated, however, the act is based on the Draft Uniform Product Liability Law (draft act), published by the Department of Commerce on January 12, 1979, in 44 Fed. Reg. 2996 et seq. for public comment. See <em>Freeman </em>v. <em>Alamo Management Co., </em>221 Conn. 674, 681 n.7, 607 A.2d 370 (1992); <em>Winslow </em>v. <em>Lewis-Shephard, Inc., </em>supra, 212 Conn. 469. This origin of our act is indicated by the date of its adoption,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> its language,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and its legislative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>history.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> There are substantial differences between the model act and the draft act. This is particularly so in regard to \u00a7 112 of the model act, upon which the defendant relies, as indicated below in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">The defendant, in addition to denying liability, raised two special defenses that are relevant to this appeal. In the first special defense, upon which the trial court instructed the jury, it alleged misuse of the product under the common law. The defendant based this claim on its allegations that the plaintiff descended the ladder as though it were a staircase, facing away from the ladder, and failed to read and follow the instructions and warnings concerning the use of the ladder. In the second special defense, predicated upon General Statutes \u00a7 52-572p, the defendant alleged that the \u201cladder was altered or modified by the plaintiffs or a third-party from the condition in which it was sold.\u201d The trial court refused to instruct the jury on the second special defense,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> but did instruct on the first. The defendant claims that, although the trial court satisfactorily instructed the jury on the common law defense of misuse, it was also entitled to an instruction on the second special defense predicated on statutory altera<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>tion/modification by misuse under \u00a7 52-572p. Section 52-572p provides in pertinent part: \u201c(a) A product seller shall not be liable for harm that would not have occurred but for the fact that his product was altered or modified by a third party unless: (1) The alteration or modification was in accordance with the instructions or specifications of the product seller; (2) the alteration or modification was made with the consent of the product seller; or (3) the alteration or modification was the result of conduct that reasonably should have been anticipated by the product seller, (b) For the purposes of this section, alteration or modification includes changes in the design, formula, function or <em>use </em>of the product from that originally designed, tested or intended by the product seller.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">The defendant argues that the defense of misuse under the common law and the defense of alteration/modification by \u201cchanges in the . . . use of the product\u201d under \u00a7 52-572p are separate and distinct defenses. The distinction drawn by the defendant is as follows: common law misuse is the failure to use a product in the manner intended by or reasonably foreseeable to the seller, while alteration/modification by misuse under \u00a7 52-572p \u201cchanges some essential characteristic of the product so that the user no longer views the product as it was intended by the manufacturer. It makes the user behave differently than he or she would have behaved if the product was not altered.\u201d This is certainly a fine line distinction and would appear, in this case, to be a distinction without a difference.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">We agree with the defendant that misuse under the common law \u201coccurs when a product is not used \u2018in a manner which should have been foreseen by the defendant.\u2019 \u201d <em>Norrie </em>v. <em>Heil Co., </em>203 Conn. 594, 600, 525 A.2d 1332 (1987), quoting <em>Hoelter </em>v. <em>Mohawk Service, Inc., </em>170 Conn. 495, 517, 365 A.2d 1064 (1976). We also determine in this opinion that the common law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>defense of misuse by a plaintiff may be asserted in a claim brought under the act. We disagree, however, with the claim that the \u00a7 52-572p alteration/modification by misuse defense has any application to conduct by a plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">In reaching our conclusion, we begin with the plain language of the act. \u201cThis court has consistently stated that [i]f the language of the statute is clear and unambiguous, it is assumed that the words themselves express the intention of the legislature and there is no room for judicial construction.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Vaillancourt </em>v. <em>New Britain Machine/Litton, </em>224 Conn. 382, 395, 618 A.2d 1340 (1993). By its own terms, \u00a7 52-572p limits its application to alterations and modifications made by a \u201cthird party.\u201d The term \u201cthird party\u201d is not defined in the act. \u201cWhere a statute . . . does not define a term, it is appropriate to focus upon its common understanding as expressed in the law and upon its dictionary meaning.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>AirKaman, Inc. </em>v. <em>Groppo, </em>221 Conn. 751, 756-57, 607 A.2d 410 (1992). The dictionary definition of \u201cthird party\u201d is \u201c[o]ne not a party . . . to . . . an action\u201d; Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6th Ed. 1990); and therefore does not include a plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">This conclusion is further reinforced by analyzing \u00a7 52-572p within the context of the act as a whole. The act provides the following definition of \u201cclaimant\u201d: \u201c[A] person asserting a product liability claim for damages incurred by the claimant or one for whom the claimant is acting in a representative capacity.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> General Statutes \u00a7 52-572m (c). Accordingly, the plaintiff in this case is clearly a \u201cclaimant.\u201d If the legislature had intended to include a plaintiff\u2019s conduct under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>\u00a7 52-572p, it would have made the provision expressly applicable to \u201cclaimants\u201d as it did with other provisions in the act. See, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 52-572o (a) and 52-572q (a) and (b); see also <em>New Haven </em>v. <em>United Illuminating Co., </em>168 Conn. 478, 485, 362 A.2d 785 (1975) (in determining the meaning of a word or designation, it is appropriate to look to related statutory provisions). Therefore, the legislature appears to have unambiguously crafted an alteration/modification defense that is not applicable to the conduct of a claimant.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">Even if it can be argued that \u201cthird party\u201d as set out in \u00a7 52-572p is ambiguous, we determine that the \u201cclaimant\u201d is not within its scope for several reasons. First, because our Product Liability Act is modeled on the draft act, we look for guidance to commentaries on the draft act. <em>Maloney </em>v. <em>Pac, </em>183 Conn. 313, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>326-27, 439 A.2d 349 (1981). More specifically, we consult the commentary to \u00a7 110 of the draft act because \u00a7 52-572p adopted the language of that provision nearly verbatim.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The commentary states that \u00a7 110 of the draft act \u201cdeals with the situation where a third <em>party\u2014one other than </em>the product seller or <em>the </em>claimant\u2014has altered or modified the product and this has led to [the] claimant\u2019s harm.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) 44 Fed. Reg. 3010 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">Second, our conclusion that the \u00a7 52-572p alteration/modification defense does not apply to the conduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>of a claimant is further reinforced by its plain language that, with certain exceptions, provides for a complete bar to recovery when the product has been altered or modified. That statute provides that the product seller <em>\u201cshall not be liable </em>for harm that would not have occurred but for the fact that his product was altered or modified by a third party . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) Of course, the defendant\u2019s argument that the absolute bar of \u00a7 52-572p is applicable to the conduct of a claimant is inconsistent with \u00a7 52-572o,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> which provides that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>the claimant\u2019s right to recover is based on pure comparative responsibility. In other words, a partial recovery is allowed even if the claimant\u2019s injury is attributable mostly to his or her conduct.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> \u201cA statute should be read as a whole and interpreted so as to give effect to all of its provisions.\u201d <em>Pintavalle </em>v. <em>Volkanos, </em>216 Conn. 412, 418, 581 A.2d 1050 (1990). The purpose of this rule is to avoid construing the statutes in such a way as to create a conflict between statutes; \u201c[sjuch . . . reconciliation is especially important in dealing with provisions that are enacted as part of the same legislation.\u201d <em>Malerba </em>v. <em>Cessna Aircraft Co., </em>210 Conn. 189, 195, 554 A.2d 287 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">Third, construing \u00a7 52-572p to apply only to the conduct of persons or entities other than the claimant whose modifications or alterations of the product cause the claimant\u2019s injury is consistent with our common law. Prior to the enactment of the act, we adopted a cause of action in strict tort liability based on the Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 402 A. <em>Rossignol </em>v. <em>Danbury School of Aeronautics, Inc., </em>154 Conn. 549, 559-60, 227 A.2d 418 (1967). Section 402 A shields defendants from liability for products altered or modified by providing that the product seller can be liable only when the seller\u2019s product \u201cwas expected to and did <em>reach the user or consumer without substantial change in the condition in which it was sold. \u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>Prokolkin </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp., </em>170 Conn. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>289, 299, 365 A.2d 1180 (1976); <em>Rossignol </em>v. <em>Danbury School of Aeronautics, Inc., </em>supra, 559. In other words, the defendant would be absolved of liability under \u00a7 402 A if the plaintiffs injury was the result of an alteration or modification to the product made by a third party. See 2 Restatement (Second), Torts \u00a7 402 A, comment (g) (1965). \u201cIn determining whether or not a statute abrogates or modifies a common-law rule the construction must be strict, and the operation of a statute in derogation of the common law is to be limited to matters clearly brought within its scope.\u201d <em>Willoughby </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>123 Conn. 446, 454, 197 A. 85 (1937).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">Our conclusion leaves the defense of misuse on the part of the claimant without an express statutory basis in the act. Although \u00a7 52-572o, the comparative responsibility provision, is based on and mirrors the first part of \u00a7 111 of the draft act, the second part of \u00a7 111 extends beyond \u00a7 52-572o by expressly delineating the specific types of conduct that are chargeable to the claimant, including misuse.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The legislative history of our act is silent as to the reason why this part of \u00a7 111 was not adopted.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>Nevertheless, it is apparent that the legislature did not intend to eliminate consideration of the claimant\u2019s conduct in determining liability or the amount of damages. Otherwise, there would be no purpose for adopting the principle of comparative responsibility under \u00a7 52-572o. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>\u201cIn construing a statute, common sense must be used, and courts will assume that the legislature intended to accomplish a reasonable and rational result.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Hinton, </em>227 Conn. 301, 320, 630 A.2d 593 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">Furthermore, under our common and statutory law, misuse by the claimant is a defense to a product liability action. General Statutes \u00a7 52-572l;<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <em>Norrie </em>v. <em>Heil Co., </em>supra, 203 Conn. 594. We will not interpret a statute to have the effect of altering prior statutory or common law unless the language of the statute clearly expresses an intent to have such an effect. <em>Lynn </em>v. <em>Haybuster Mfg., Inc., </em>supra, 226 Conn. 290. No language of the act expresses such an intent. To the contrary, \u00a7 52-572o (a) contains broad language requiring the trier of fact to consider \u201cthe comparative responsibility of, or attributed to, the claimant, [which] shall not bar recovery but shall diminish the award of compensatory damages proportionately, according to the measure of responsibility attributed to the claimant.\u201d It is reasonable to construe this broad language to incorporate the defense of misuse of a product by a claimant. Accordingly, we conclude that the legislature did not intend to abrogate this common law defense, but rather the act incorporates misuse as part of the consideration of pure comparative fault.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">With this statutory construction in mind, we now turn to the trial court\u2019s instructions on misuse. With regard to the first certified question, although our conclusion is based on reasoning not relied upon by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>Appellate Court, we agree with that court that the defendant was not entitled to a jury instruction on the defense of alteration/modification by misuse under \u00a7 52-572p. The trial judge did instruct on misuse under the common law and the defendant does not raise any claim of error in this respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">In regard to the second certified question, we conclude, and the defendant conceded at oral argument, that comparative responsibility under \u00a7 52-572o is applicable to the common law misuse defense. The defendant\u2019s claim that comparative responsibility is not applicable to misuse has reference solely to \u00a7 52-572p.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b524-5\"> The plaintiff Robin Elliot, the wife of the named plaintiff, joined this action claiming damages for loss of consortium.

The jury found that her damages totaled $10,000, and that those damages should be reduced by 25 percent as a result of her husband\u2019s comparative responsibility. The trial court accordingly rendered judgment in her favor in the amount of $7500.

Proc., Pt. 14,1979 Sess., p. 4636, remarks of Senator Salvatore C. DePiano.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b531-6\"> The legislature\u2019s first attempt to enact a comprehensive product liability act; Public Acts 1978, No. 78-380; was vetoed by Governor Ella Grasso. Conn. Senate Journal, Pt. 2, Veto Message (June 7,1978). Substantial differences between the product liability act and its vetoed predecessor provide additional evidence that the legislature\u2019s omission of \u201cclaimant\u201d from General Statutes \u00a7 52-572p was intentional. The vetoed bill contained the following open-ended language: \u201cIn any products liability action, the manufacturer shall not be liable for any injury, death or property damage caused by a product <em>which has been substantially altered or modified. </em>\u201d (Emphasis added.) Public Acts 1978, No. 78-380, \u00a7 4. It would appear that this broad language would apply to the conduct of a claimant as well as the conduct of third parties. In her veto message, Governor Grasso stated that one of the fatal flaws of the 1978 bill was an overly broad product alteration or modification defense. Conn. Senate Journal, Pt. 2, Veto Message (June 7, 1978). The 1979 bill; Public Acts 1979, No. 79-483, \u00a7 5; enacted as our Product Liability Act, is limited expressly to conduct of third parties. John Anderson, who served on the governor\u2019s product liability task force, testified before the judiciary committee in support of the 1979 bill: \u201cLast year . . . [the product modification section was] basically framed in terms of [an] absolute [defense]. This year, our approach is quite different and it\u2019s modeled very much after the United States Commerce Department document. With respect to modification, it\u2019s a very qualified and conditioned defense.\u201d Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Judiciary, Pt. 2, 1979 Sess., p. 569.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b532-6\"> Section 110 of the draft act provides: \u201c(a) A product seller shall not be liable for harm that would not have occurred but for the fact that his product was altered or modified by a third party unless: (1) The alteration or modification was in accordance with the product seller\u2019s instructions or specifications; (2) The alteration or modification was made with the <em>express </em>consent of the product seller; or (3) The alteration or modification was the result of conduct that reasonably should have been anticipated by the product seller, (b) For the purposes of this section, alteration or modification includes changes in the design, formula, function or use of the product from that originally designed, tested or intended by the product seller. <em>It includes failure to observe routine care and maintenance, but does not include ordinary wear and tear. \u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) 44 Fed. Reg. 3000. Except for the omission of the emphasized language, General Statutes \u00a7 52-572p is identical to \u00a7 110.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b532-7\"> Section 112 of the model act, on which the defendant claims that General Statutes \u00a7 52-572p was based, contains language substantially different than that of \u00a7 110 of the draft act. Section 112 provides in relevant part: \u201c(D) Alteration or Modification of a Product. (1) \u2018Alteration or modification\u2019 occurs when a <em>person or entity other than the product seller </em>changes the design, construction, or formula of the product, or changes or removes warnings or instructions that accompanied or were displayed on the product. ... (2) When the product seller proves, by a preponderance of the evidence, that an alteration or modification of the product <em>by the claimant, </em>or by a party other than the claimant or the product seller, has caused the claimant\u2019s harm, the claimant\u2019s damages shall be subject to reduction or apportionment to the extent that the alteration or modification was a cause of the harm. Under this Subsection, the trier of fact may determine that the harm arose solely because of the product alteration or modification.\u201d (Emphasis added.) 44 Fed. Reg. 62737. The emphasized language demonstrates a clear intent to reach the conduct of a claimant, and to apply the principle of comparative fault to the conduct of a claimant. Therefore, \u00a7 112 of the model act bears little resemblance to \u00a7 52-572p.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b533-5\"> The commentary to the draft act explains the considerations underlying the rule of \u00a7 110 that the product seller is not liable when a third party\u2019s alterations or modifications of the product cause the plaintiffs injury. To impose liability in such cases would \u201cborder on absolute liability\u201d and would \u201cfail to place the incentive for risk prevention on the party or parties who have engaged in the wrongful conduct.\u201d 44 Fed.
