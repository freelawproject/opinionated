The plaintiff, Keary Mulligan, brought a personal injury action against the defendants, Allen S. Hall, J.A.C.E. Transportation Company, Inc., and Housatonic Area Regional Transit. Over his protest, the trial court, <em>West, J., </em>granted a motion to intervene filed by the plaintiff\u2019s employer, Chemsearch, Inc. (employer), in order to secure a workers\u2019 compensation lien for amounts previously paid to the injured plaintiff.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>The trial court, <em>Fuller, J., </em>rendered a stipulated judgment awarding the plaintiff $1,500,000 in damages in discharge of all claims against the defendants. The court noted the agreement of the parties that the amount of the challenged workers\u2019 compensation lien was $200,779.10. As part of the stipulated judgment, the court stated, on the record, that the plaintiff had reserved \u201cthe right to take an appeal to challenge the question of the intervention of the action.\u201d The stipulated judgment was rendered in the presence of counsel for the employer, who agreed that the plaintiff had his right, \u201cwhatever it is.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">The Appellate Court declined to consider the plaintiffs appeal on its merits. <em>Mulligan </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>32 Conn. App. 203, 628 A.2d 621 (1993). The court concluded that the plaintiff had no right to appeal from a stipulated judgment without a showing that his consent to the judgment had been obtained by fraud, accident or mistake. Id., 204. In the absence of a motion in the trial court to open or to set aside the judgment, the court decided that it lacked the authority to review the stipulated judgment. Id., 205. We granted the plaintiff\u2019s petition for certification,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">The Appellate Court misconceived the scope and the intent of the stipulated judgment. That judgment liquidated and settled the plaintiff\u2019s claims against the defendants. Neither the plaintiff nor the employer challenges the terms of the settlement. The only issue between them is the proper allocation of the settlement proceeds. It would therefore serve no purpose for the plaintiff to move to set aside the stipulated judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>The Appellate Court correctly analyzed the stipulated judgment as having the effect of a contractual agreement. See <em>Gillis </em>v. <em>Gillis, </em>214 Conn. 336, 339-40, 572 A.2d 323 (1990), and cases therein cited. There is, however, nothing inconsistent, illogical or unlawful in an agreement between two parties that expressly or impliedly reserves the rights of one of the parties against a third party. It is commonplace, in a personal injury action, to have an injured party negotiate a settlement that results in a release of some but not all the alleged joint tortfeasors. Even without an express reservation of rights, a general release discharges only those joint tortfeasors whom the contracting parties actually intended to be released. <em>Sims </em>v. <em>Honda Motor Co., </em>225 Conn. 401, 406, 623 A.2d 995 (1993). Similarly, even without an express reservation of rights, a creditor who enters into a settlement with a debtor discharges the debtor\u2019s surety only to the extent that the settlement prejudices the surety. Cf. General Statutes \u00a7 42a-3-605 (d) (as amended 1991). With an express reservation of rights, a creditor retains rights against an insurer, even when the creditor\u2019s actions have resulted in the discharge of the underlying debtor\u2019s monetary obligations. <em>Burritt Mutual Savings Bank </em>v. <em>Transamerica Ins. Co., </em>180 Conn. 71, 82, 428 A.2d 333 (1980). In the specific context of workers\u2019 compensation claims, a stipulated judgment between the injured plaintiff and the tortfeasors does not bar subsequent litigation about the extent of the employer\u2019s lien. See <em>Love </em>v. <em>J. P. Stevens &amp; Co., </em>218 Conn. 46, 49, 587 A.2d 1042 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\">In the circumstances of this case, likewise, the settlement between the injured plaintiff and the defendants properly reserved the plaintiff\u2019s right to contest the employer\u2019s lien on the settlement proceeds. The record unambiguously reflects that the stipulated judgment arising out of the settlement was understood by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>the parties thereto to have preserved the plaintiffs right to appeal that issue. The employer, through the presence of his attorney, had notice of the plaintiffs reservation of rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">Only an appeal can afford the plaintiff the opportunity to vindicate the rights that he expressly reserved. The Appellate Court should consider the merits of his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to reinstate the plaintiffs appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b247-9\"> The trial court, <em>Fuller, J., </em>subsequently also granted the Second Injury Fund the right to intervene but it has not participated in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b248-8\"> We granted the plaintiff\u2019s petition for certification, limited to the following issue: \u201cDid the Appellate Court properly dismiss this appeal from a stipulated judgment in a personal injury action involving a workers\u2019 compensation claim, when the parties had reserved, in stipulating to the judgment, the right to appeal and to challenge the trial court\u2019s earlier granting of the employer\u2019s motion to intervene?\u201d <em>Mulligan </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>227 Conn. 931, 632 A.2d 707 (1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
