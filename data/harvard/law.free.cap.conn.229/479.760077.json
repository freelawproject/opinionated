Rioux, as an individual and in his capacity as high sheriff of Hartford county, for wrongfully terminating the plaintiff\u2019s employment for the alleged purposes of misappropriating the plaintiff\u2019s business of serving process and furthering the defendant\u2019s own illegal fee splitting enterprise. The principal issue on appeal is whether the trial court properly dismissed the suit on the grounds that the doctrine of sovereign immunity and the immunity provisions of General Statutes \u00a7 4-165 shielded the defendant from suit in his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>capacity as sheriff and as an individual, respectively.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Because we conclude that the defendant\u2019s alleged conduct exceeded his authority and was outside the scope of his employment as high sheriff, he is not immune from suit. Accordingly, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">The plaintiff brought a five count complaint seeking damages and injunctive relief against the defendant individually and in his capacity as sheriff for: (1) violation of the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act (General Statutes \u00a7 42-110a et seq.); (2) tortious interference with the plaintiff\u2019s contractual relationships; (3) racketeering activities; (4) illegal conspiracy; and (5) breach of contract. The plaintiff alleged in each of the five counts in his complaint the following facts that, for the purposes of this appeal, we consider to be accurate. From 1980 through 1991 the plaintiff maintained a highly profitable business with clients statewide as a deputy sheriff serving process and papers and executing process in Hartford county. To assist him in this business, the plaintiff employed Lori Chirico as a secretary to handle collections, type returns of service and deal with clients. As a result, Chirico became thoroughly familiar with all of the plaintiff\u2019s accounts and customer lists.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">In 1990, the defendant hired Chirico as his personal secretary, although his appointment of her as a special deputy<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> allowed him to pay her with state funds. At or around the same time, the defendant entered into agreements with several deputy sheriffs he had appointed. Under the agreements, the defendant was to forward business he had obtained from law firms and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>state agencies to designated deputy sheriffs who would thereafter serve process, and, in turn, pay him 40 percent of the statutory rate in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 6-46 and 53a-161c.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">Each count contained the critical allegation that the defendant, after forming the agreement with the deputy sheriffs, terminated the plaintiffs employment for the purposes of obtaining the plaintiffs business and personally benefiting from the forbidden and illegal fee splitting arrangements the defendant had devised. Thereafter, the plaintiff, on the basis of these shared facts, asserted particular legal claims accompanied by additional supporting allegations. The plaintiff claimed that the defendant, by his illegal conduct, tortiously interfered with the plaintiffs contractual relationships and breached his employment contract. The plaintiff further alleged that the defendant\u2019s efforts to engage in unfair methods of competition and unfair and deceptive acts or practices in the distribution of service of process, and the restraint, termination and confiscation by the defendant of the plaintiffs business for his own personal gain were in violation of General Stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>utes \u00a7 42-110b<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> et seq. Moreover, the plaintiff claimed that the defendant, by having engaged in racketeering activities in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-159, 53a-161 and 53a-161c,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> caused him serious economic and personal injury in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53-395 et seq.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>The defendant moved to dismiss the plaintiffs complaint, arguing that the action against him in his official capacity was barred by the doctrine of sovereign immunity and that the action against him in his individual capacity was barred by the immunity provisions of General Statutes \u00a7 4-165.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The trial court granted the defendant\u2019s motion and dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s complaint. The trial court in its memorandum of decision concluded that the defendant was personally immune from suit because, pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 6-37 and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>6-45,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the high sheriff has the unlimited statutory authority to hire and fire a deputy sheriff \u201cat his pleasure regardless of his motives or the propriety of his reasons for such dismissal.\u201d The trial court also noted that, to defeat the doctrine of sovereign immunity, the plaintiff had to point to a legislative enactment indicating the state\u2019s consent to be sued. The trial court concluded that the plaintiff\u2019s reliance on General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 6-30 and 6-30a<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> was misplaced, and, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>in the absence of any other provision expressly authorizing suit against the sheriff for wrongful termination of employment, the doctrine of sovereign immunity insulated the defendant from suit in his official capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">On appeal, the plaintiff argues that because the defendant fired him to further his own financial gain through a fee splitting agreement with various deputy sheriffs in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 6-36 and 6-46,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the defendant exceeded his authority as high sheriff and, therefore, cannot claim the protection of sovereign immunity.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The plaintiff similarly contends that because the defendant\u2019s behavior exceeded the scope of his employment, the defendant cannot claim the personal immunity afforded by \u00a7 4-165. Finally, the plaintiff argues that the express exception contained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>in \u00a7 4-165, eliminating immunity for a state employee acting in a wanton, reckless or malicious fashion, precludes the defendant from asserting the immunity defense. We agree with the plaintiff and therefore conclude that the trial court should not have dismissed the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">\u201cWe have . . . recognized that because the state can act only through its officers and agents, a suit against a state officer concerning a matter in which the officer represents the state is, in effect, against the state.\u2019 <em>Sentner </em>v. <em>Board of Trustees, </em>184 Conn. 339, 342, 439 A.2d 1033 (1981). In its pristine form the doctrine of sovereign immunity would exempt the state from suit entirely, because the sovereign could not be sued in its own courts and \u2018there can be no legal right as against the authority that makes the law on which the right depends.\u2019 <em>Kawananakoa </em>v. <em>Polyblank, </em>205 U.S. 349, 353, 27 S. Ct. 526, 51 L. Ed. 834 (1907); <em>Bergner </em>v. <em>State, </em>144 Conn. 282, 284-85, 130 A.2d 293 (1957). This absolute bar of actions against the state has been greatly modified both by statutes effectively consenting to suit in some instances as well as by judicial decisions in others.\u201d <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Heintz, </em>204 Conn. 17, 31, 526 A.2d 1318 (1987); see also 57 Am. Jur. 2d, Municipal, County, School and State Tort Liability \u00a7 61 et seq. (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">\u201cIt does not necessarily follow, however, that every action in which state officials or members of state agencies are named defendants and designated by official titles should be treated as an action against the state such as to clothe the defendants with immunity from suit.\u201d <em>Simmons </em>v. <em>Parizek, </em>158 Conn. 304, 307, 259 A.2d 642 (1969). Sovereign immunity does not bar suits against state officials acting in excess of their statu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>tory authority or pursuant to an unconstitutional statute. <em>Horton </em>v. <em>Meskill, </em>172 Conn. 615, 624, 376 A.2d 359 (1977).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">\u201c \u2018In those cases in which it is alleged that the defendant officer is proceeding ... in excess of his statutory authority, the interest in the protection of the plaintiffs right to be free from the consequences of such action outweighs the interest served by the sovereign immunity doctrine. . . .\u2019 \u201d Id., quoting J. Block, \u201cSuits Against Government Officers and the Sovereign Immunity Doctrine,\u201d 59 Harv. L. Rev. 1060, 1080-81 (1946). In such instances, the need to protect the government simply does not arise and \u201cthe government cannot justifiably claim interference with its functions . . . .\u2019\u201d <em>Horton </em>v. <em>Meskill, </em>supra, 172 Conn. 624. \u201c \u2018Where[, however,] no substantial claim is made that the defendant officer is acting pursuant to an unconstitutional enactment or in excess of his statutory authority, the purpose of the sovereign immunity doctrine requires dismissal of the suit for want of jurisdiction.\u2019 \u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">In light of these principles, the dispositive issue faced by the trial court in this case in determining whether to dismiss the action on the grounds of sovereign immunity was whether the defendant had allegedly acted in excess of his statutory authority when he terminated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>the plaintiff\u2019s employment. Although we have recognized the legal principle that sovereign immunity does not apply to suits against state officials acting in excess of their statutory authority, we have never had occasion actually to apply that doctrine. This case presents the first opportunity to do so. We begin with a discussion of the standard for appellate review of a trial court\u2019s dismissal of a complaint for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">\u201c[T]he doctrine of sovereign immunity implicates subject matter jurisdiction and is therefore a basis for granting a motion to dismiss.\u201d <em>Amore </em>v. <em>Frankel, </em>228 Conn. 358, 364, 636 A.2d 786 (1994). \u201cWhen a [trial] court decides a jurisdictional question raised by a pretrial motion to dismiss, it must consider the allegations of the complaint in their most favorable light.\u201d <em>Reynolds </em>v. <em>Soffer, </em>183 Conn. 67, 68, 438 A.2d 1163 (1981). Because this case comes to us on a threshold sovereign immunity issue, pursuant to a motion to dismiss; Practice Book \u00a7 143; we do not pass on whether the complaint was legally sufficient to state a cause of action. <em>Gurliacci </em>v. <em>Mayer, </em>218 Conn. 531, 544, 590 A.2d 914 (1991). In the posture of this case, we examine the pleadings to decide if the plaintiff has alleged sufficient facts: (1) with respect to sovereign immunity, to support a conclusion that the defendant acted in excess of his statutory authority; and (2) with respect to personal immunity under \u00a7 4-165, to support a conclusion that the defendant was acting outside the scope of his employment or wilfully or maliciously. Id., 542; see <em>Barde </em>v. <em>Board of Trustees, </em>207 Conn. 59, 64, 539 A.2d 1000 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">The plaintiff maintains that he has met his burden. The defendant argues, however, that the plaintiff\u2019s allegation that the defendant had engaged in or had planned to engage in prohibited conduct <em>after </em>the plaintiffs dismissal does not constitute an act in excess of authority. Such an argument reflects a formalistic and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>myopic view of the complaint and contradicts the modern trend to read pleadings broadly and realistically rather than narrowly and technically. See <em>Beaudoin </em>v. <em>Town Oil Co., </em>207 Conn. 575, 588, 542 A.2d 1124 (1988), and cases cited therein. We conclude that the factual allegations, common to each of the five 'counts, broadly, rather than narrowly, construed make out a claim that the defendant was acting in excess of his statutory authority when he terminated the plaintiffs employment in order to accomplish that which \u00a7\u00a7 6-36 and 6-46 specifically prohibit.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">Each of the five counts contained in the complaint expressly states that \u201c[tjhe defendant, Alfred J. Rioux did intentionally terminate the plaintiff, Joseph Antinerella for the express purpose of obtaining his business and personally benefitting under the forbidden and illegal fee splitting arrangements he had with appointed deputy sheriffs.\u201d The plaintiff also alleged that: (1) the defendant \u201chas engaged in unfair methods of competition and unfair and deceptive acts or practices in the distribution of service of process, the restraint of the [pjlaintiff s business, the termination of the [pjlaintiff s business and the taking of the [pjlaintiff s business for his own personal gain in violation of [General Statutes \u00a7 42-110a et seq.J\u201d; (2) \u201c[tjhe [djefendant's tortious interference arises out of his scheme and conspiracy to obtain the [pjlaintiff s client list and establish a system by which the customers and clients of the [pjlaintiff would thereafter be necessitated or required to use the services of the [djefendant thereby providing him with personal gain for the [djefendanf s tortious interference with the [pjlaintiff s contractual relationships\u201d; (3) the defendant: (a) \u201c[cjonspired to take the [pjlaintiff s business\u201d; (b) \u201c[tjerminated the [pjlaintiff s license to serve process without good or reasonable cause\u201d; and (c) \u201c[cjonspired with deputy sheriffs to fabricate false accusation and allegations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>against [the plaintiff] to use as a basis to terminate [the plaintiff]\u201d; and (4) the \u201c[defendant did engage in activity in violation of [General Statutes \u00a7 6-46] of receiving compensation from deputy sheriffs, in fee splitting, which activity was established to provide benefit to the [defendant upon [the plaintiffs] termination.\u201d Construing the pleaded facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiff; <em>Duguay </em>v. <em>Hopkins, </em>191 Conn. 222, 227, 464 A.2d 45 (1983); we, therefore, presume that the defendant discharged the plaintiff in order to take his business and personally benefit under the statutorily forbidden and illegal fee splitting arrangement he had made with several appointed deputy sheriffs. That termination of his employment under the facts and circumstances of this case constituted an action in excess of his authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">The defendant argues that because \u00a7 6-45 authorizes him to terminate the employment of deputies at will, his termination of the plaintiffs employment could not have been in excess of his statutory authority. We disagree. Not all uses of that authority are protected. For example, had the defendant used his authority to transport a prisoner, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 6-32d,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> for the express purpose of arranging for that prisoner to be assaulted, such intentional criminal behavior would not be shielded. Similarly, despite the sheriffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>authority to hire and fire contained in \u00a7 6-45, the plaintiffs allegations as set forth in the complaint describe a course of conduct that is egregious in nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">The defendant also posits that because his appointment of deputy sheriffs is solely within his discretion, deputy sheriffs have no entitlement and, therefore, cannot claim interference with any business interest. In <em>Sheets </em>v. <em>Teddy\u2019s Frosted Foods, Inc., </em>179 Conn. 471, 427 A.2d 385 (1980), we provided a public policy exception to the employment at-will rule in an effort to balance the competing interests of employer and employee. The employer must be allowed to make personnel decisions without fear of incurring civil liability. The employee, however, must be protected against actions by his employer that contravene public policy. \u201cGiven the inherent vagueness of the concept of public policy, it is often difficult to define precisely the contours of the exception. [We look to see whether] the plaintiff has . . . alleged that his discharge violated any explicit statutory or constitutional provision . . . [or whether] he alleged that his dismissal contravened any judicially conceived notion of public policy.\u201d <em>Morris </em>v. <em>Hartford Courant Co., </em>200 Conn. 676, 680, 513 A.2d 66 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>Application of that doctrine is particularly appropriate under the facts and circumstances of this case when, according to the allegations considered to be true for purposes of the motion to dismiss, the defendant has acted to accomplish what statutes specifically prohibited him from doing. Sections 6-36 and 6-46 reflect the clear public policy that a high sheriff may not engage in fee splitting. It would be totally incongruous for the legislature to prohibit any fee splitting by the high sheriff, but nevertheless for us to allow him to advance the scheme by terminating the plaintiffs employment with total immunity. Sections 6-36 and 6-46 are indicative of the public policy that the defendant\u2019s scheme was aimed at circumventing. This case presents claims that genuinely involve the mandates of public policy derived directly from state statutes. \u201cCertainly when there is a relevant state statute we should not ignore the statement of public policy that it represents.\u201d <em>Sheets </em>v. <em>Teddy\u2019s Frosted Foods, Inc., </em>supra, 179 Conn. 480.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">Had the plaintiff been the one to discover the defendant\u2019s illegal fee splitting scheme and the one to \u201cblow the whistle\u201d on the defendant, and had the defendant thereafter fired the plaintiff in order to continue his illegal conduct, undoubtedly, the plaintiff could bring an action for retaliatory discharge. Id. We see no reason to differentiate between that employee and this plaintiff, whose employment was also terminated in order that his employer could perpetuate a fee splitting arrangement, a scheme clearly prohibited by statute. We reject the defendant\u2019s contention that the plaintiff\u2019s allegations do not support his claim that his employment had been terminated in violation of a distinct public policy. We are persuaded that the plaintiff\u2019s complaint, read so as to sustain its validity, amply charges that \u201chis discharge involve[d] \u2018impropriety <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>. . . derived from some important violation of a public policy.\u2019\u201d Mag<em>nan </em>v. <em>Anaconda Industries, Inc., </em>193 Conn. 558, 572, 479 A.2d 781 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">Finally, the defendant argues that \u00a7\u00a7 6-36 and 6-46, which authorize the removal from office of any high sheriff who engages in fee splitting, were intended by the legislature to provide a sufficient remedy to deter such illegal conduct and to protect deputy sheriffs from such intimidation. According to the defendant, neither statute provides any rights of employment to a deputy, limits the authority of the high sheriff to dismiss deputy sheriffs or allows for private enforcement of their provisions. The defendant further asserts that the ethics commission is empowered to impose the appropriate remedy for violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 1-84 (c) and 1-85. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 1-88 and 1-89.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">These statutes provide for a public remedy and are indicative of our public policy, consistent with the legislature\u2019s obvious interest in ensuring that elected officials conduct themselves within the parameters of the law, that any sheriff who has engaged in this kind of prohibited conduct has abused his authority and deserves to be removed from office.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> That does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>mean, however, that a private remedy for the same conduct can never coexist.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\">In determining whether a statute prohibiting certain conduct also affords a private cause of action for damages, we generally apply the rule of statutory construction that \u201c[w]hen the legislature has authorized supplementary private causes of action, it has done so expressly. See, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 22a-16 (Connecticut Environmental Protection Act) and 42-110g (a) (Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act).\u201d <em>Middletown </em>v. <em>Hartford Electric Light Co., </em>192 Conn. 591, 596, 473 A.2d 787 (1984). As part of this analysis, we assess whether the legislature concluded that private interests were amply served without private causes of action. For example, in the area of environmental law, we have examined the administrative regulatory process to see if private persons had been afforded access by way of complaints to the Connecticut department of environmental protection or the council on environmental quality. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">Sections 6-36 and 6-46 provide solely for the public\u2019s rights to be vindicated through the authority of the Superior Court and the General Assembly to terminate the high sheriff\u2019s employment. Although we find nothing in any of the pertinent provisions that specifically prohibits a private cause of action by an injured dep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>uty sheriff whose employment has been terminated by the high sheriff in order to effectuate an illegal purpose, these statutes do \u201cnot [expressly] authorize a private cause of action for damages. Thus the plaintiffs action is necessarily at common law.\u201d <em>Boehm </em>v. <em>Kish, </em>201 Conn. 385, 389, 517 A.2d 624 (1986). We already have recognized the existence of a common law action for an at-will employee whose employment has been terminated in violation of a distinct public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">Because this case involves a significant matter of clear and well defined public policy, this plaintiff is no less entitled to a modicum of judicial protection. We conclude that the mandates of public policy derived directly from \u00a7\u00a7 6-36 and 6-46 impose some limits on the defendant\u2019s unbridled discretion to terminate a deputy\u2019s employment and that the plaintiff is entitled to vindicate his claims through a private cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">The \u201c \u2018[p]ublic office [held by the defendant] is a trust conferred by public authority for a public purpose. . . .\u2019 \u201d <em>Gaynor-Stafford Industries, Inc. </em>v. <em>Water Pollution Control Authority, </em>192 Conn. 638, 648, 474 A.2d 752, cert. denied, 469 U.S. 932, 105 S. Ct. 328, 83 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1984); <em>State ex rel. Stage </em>v. <em>Mackie, </em>82 Conn. 398, 401, 74 A. 759 (1909). \u201c \u2018The rights, authority and duty . . . conferred upon the sheriff by law, clearly invest him with a portion of the sovereign power of the government to be exercised by him for the public good.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Application of Griffiths, </em>162 Conn. 249, 256, 294 A.2d 281 (1972), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 413 U.S. 717, 93 S. Ct. 2851, 37 L. Ed. 2d 910 (1973); <em>Sibley </em>v. <em>State, </em>89 Conn. 682, 685, 96 A. 161 (1915). \u201cIn the American system, sovereignty is inherent in the people. They can delegate it to a government which they create and operate by law. They can give to that government the power and authority to perform certain duties and furnish certain services. The government so created and empowered must employ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>people to carry on its task. Those people are agents of the government. They exercise some part of the sovereignty entrusted to it. They occupy a status entirely different from those who carry on a private enterprise. They serve the public welfare and not a private purpose.\u201d <em>Norwalk Teachers\u2019 Assn. </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>138 Conn. 269, 276, 83 A.2d 482 (1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">Our decision today supports the central statutory purpose of eradicating illegal behavior by people in authority. It also, however, allows persons who have suffered injuries as a result of these illegalities to be made whole. When an elected official acts within the limits of his or her authority, we have little occasion to supervise, review, restrain or punish. <em>LaTorre </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>167 Conn. 1, 9, 355 A.2d 101 (1974); and no reason to circumvent the doctrine of sovereign immunity. When, however, the state employee acts solely to further his or her own illegal scheme and not to carry out government policy, there is no reason to provide immunity from suit. Termination of his or her employment serves one purpose while allowing for damages to flow to the injured party serves another.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">Although there is a mounting trend to eliminate the immunity defense in many jurisdictions; see 18 E. McQuillin, Municipal Corporations (3d Ed. Rev. 1993) \u00a7 53.02.10, p. 141 n.37; the plaintiff is not seeking judicial abrogation of sovereign immunity. By our decision we do not chip away at the doctrine, relax its parameters or expand any well developed exceptions. Rather than rely on any exception to the rule, we hold simply that the doctrine does not apply when there is a substantial allegation of wrongful conduct to promote an illegal purpose in excess of the officer\u2019s statutory authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b519-9\">The second issue pertains to the plaintiff\u2019s suit against the defendant in his individual capacity. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>defendant claims that he is immune from suit by virtue of General Statutes \u00a7 4-165.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Section 4-165, however, is implicated only after it has been determined that the state may rightfully be sued. <em>McKinley </em>v. <em>Musshorn, </em>185 Conn. 616, 621, 441 A.2d 600 (1981). The trial court determined that because sovereign immunity applied, neither the state nor the defendant individually could be subject to suit. Because we have concluded that the defendant is not shielded by the sovereign immunity doctrine, we must determine what, if any, protection \u00a7 4-165 affords the defendant in his individual capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">The umbrella of personal immunity provided by \u00a7 4-165 applies only to a state officer or employee who causes injury or damage while acting \u201cwithin the scope of his [or her] employment.\u201d We have interpreted similar language in the context of an action, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 53-39a, for indemnification by an officer against his employing governmental unit for economic loss he sustained in successfully defending himself against the state\u2019s prosecution for a crime he had allegedly committed while acting \u201c \u2018in the course of his duty\u2019 \u201d as an officer. <em>Link </em>v. <em>Shelton, </em>186 Conn. 623, 627, 443 A.2d 902 (1982). In interpreting the phrase \u201cin the course of his duty\u201d as used in \u00a7 53-39a, we focused on whether the employee was reasonably fulfilling the duties of employment or doing something incidental to it. Id. In light of the allegations that the defendant\u2019s wrongful conduct was intended to effectuate an illegal fee splitting scheme for which the defendant himself could be fired, it would be inconsistent and inappropriate for us to consider such conduct by the defendant to be incidental to his employment as high sheriff or beneficial to the government as his employer.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>The defendant argues that when he terminated the plaintiff\u2019s employment, he was merely using his authority pursuant to \u00a7 6-45 and that he, therefore, was still acting within the scope of his employment. Once again, the defendant\u2019s misuse of his authority was personal to him and was not \u201c \u2018primarily employer rooted\u2019 \u201d or \u201creasonably incidental to the performance of employment duties.\u201d <em>Manale </em>v. <em>Dept. of Police, </em>673 F.2d 122, 126 (5th Cir. 1982). The defendant\u2019s alleged conduct was not designed to advance any interest of his employer, the state, and did not serve any legitimate state interest. Rather, the defendant\u2019s alleged actions were motivated by purely personal considerations entirely extraneous to his employer\u2019s interest. Therefore, we conclude that \u00a7 4-165, by its own <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>explicit and unambiguous terms, provides the defendant with no protection from suit.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">The trial court relied on \u00a7 6-45 as a blanket authorization for the defendant \u201cto dismiss deputies at his pleasure regardless of his motives or the propriety of his reasons for such dismissal.\u201d The trial court noted that \u00a7 6-45 expressly authorized the defendant to terminate the plaintiffs employment. The trial court reasoned, therefore, that the defendant could not be personally liable when acting in his official capacity with express authority. We have already concluded that \u00a7 6-45 is not authorization to act for an illegal purpose and that sovereign immunity will not protect the defendant against the allegations that he acted in excess of his authority. We hold that personal immunity provided by \u00a7 4-165 is likewise unavailable. We conclude, therefore, that the trial court should not have dismissed the plaintiffs action brought against the defendant individually.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings according to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b502-11\"> Louri Antinerella, Joseph Antinerella\u2019s wife, is also a plaintiff in this case.
