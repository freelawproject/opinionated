The trial court granted the motions for summary judgment<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> of the defendants, the Meriden board of education, the Connecticut state board of education and the commissioner of education, Gerald Tirozzi, con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>eluding that gifted children do not have a right to special education under the Connecticut constitution. The plaintiff appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c). We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-6\">The material facts are not in dispute.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The plaintiff resides in the city of Meriden and attends public school there. The defendant Meriden board of education (school board) is responsible for providing education to children who reside in the city of Meriden. In 1986, when the plaintiff was in kindergarten, he was identified by his school as gifted. Since that time, his parents have demanded that the school board provide him with a program of special education designed to meet his individual needs. Although the plaintiff has received some individualized attention in addition to his school\u2019s regular educational program, the school board has refused to provide the plaintiff with an individualized program of special education. Each year, the plaintiff has become bored and frustrated with school.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-7\">The plaintiff contends that he has a state constitutional right to receive a program of education specially designed to meet his individual needs as a gifted child. His constitutional claim is based upon the statutes that establish a program of special education for certain Connecticut schoolchildren. General Statutes \u00a7 10-76a et seq. That statutory scheme identifies a category of \u201cexceptional\u201d children who need a program of special <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>education because they deviate \u201ceither intellectually, physically, socially or emotionally so markedly from normally expected growth and development patterns\u201d that they are or \u201cwill be unable to progress effectively in a regular school program . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a710-76a(c). This category of exceptional children includes two groups: (1) children whose rate of development is impeded by a disability (children with disabilities);<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and (2) gifted children, whose rate of development is enhanced by their extraordinary learning ability or outstanding artistic talent. General Statutes \u00a710-76a(e). Special education is statutorily required, however, only for children with disabilities; General Statutes \u00a7 10-76d (b); and not for gifted children, who may be provided with a program of special education at the option of the local school board. General Statutes \u00a7 10-76d(c). The plaintiff claims that: (1) the legislature, by classifying gifted children as among those children who are unable to \u201cprogress effectively\u201d without special education, has created for those children the right to special education under article eighth, \u00a7 1,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> of the Connecticut constitution; and (2) gifted children have a right to special education commensurate with that of children with disabilities under article first, \u00a7\u00a7 1 <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and 20,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> of the Connecticut constitution. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b28-6\">Connecticut schoolchildren have a state constitutional right to an education in our free public elementary and secondary schools. Conn. Const., art. VIII, \u00a7 1; see <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>193 Conn. 93, 105, 475 A.2d 289 (1984); <em>Horton </em>v. <em>Meskill, </em>172 Conn. 615, 647, 376 A.2d 359 (1977). The plaintiff concedes, however, that the Connecticut constitution does not, standing alone, afford gifted children the right to a program of special education. He also concedes that gifted children have no state statutory right to special education, because the legislature has not mandated such a course of study for gifted pupils. The plaintiff claims, rather, that his fundamental right to a free public education includes the right to a program of special education that enables him to \u201cprogress effectively,\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> as that term is used in General Statutes \u00a7 10-76a (c), because the legislature has acknowledged that gifted children cannot achieve effective progress without a program of special education. We reject the plaintiff\u2019s argument because it is contrary to the intent and purpose of the statutory scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-7\">\u201cThe meaning to be given a statute is determined by legislative intent and that legislative intent must be determined by language actually used in the legislation.\u201d <em>Eason </em>v. <em>Welfare Commissioner, </em>171 Conn. 630, 634, 370 A.2d 1082 (1976), cert. denied, 432 U.S. 907, 97 S. Ct. 2953, 53 L. Ed. 2d 1079 (1977); <em>Demar </em>v. <em>Open Space &amp; Conservation Commission, </em>211 Conn. 416, 425, 559 A.2d 1103 (1989). In determining the meaning of a statute, \u201cthe statute must be considered as a whole, with a view toward reconciling its separate parts in order to render a reasonable overall interpretation.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number><em>American Universal Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>DelGreco, </em>205 Conn. 178, 193, 530 A.2d 171 (1987); <em>Demar </em>v. <em>Open Space &amp; Conservation Commission, </em>supra. Moreover, \u201cthe legislature is presumed to have intended a reasonable, just and constitutional result\u201d; <em>Sanzone </em>v. <em>Board of Police Commissioners, </em>219 Conn. 179, 187, 592 A.2d 912 (1991); <em>Moscone </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>185 Conn. 124, 128, 440 A.2d 848 (1981); and \u201cwe will search for an effective and constitutional construction that reasonably accords with the legislature\u2019s underlying intent.\u201d <em>Bartholomew </em>v. <em>Schweizer, </em>217 Conn. 671, 675-76, 587 A.2d 1014 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">Applying these well established rules of statutory construction to our special education statutes, we conclude that the legislature did not intend to create a right to special education for gifted children. Although the language of \u00a7 10-76a (c) includes gifted children as among those exceptional children who do not \u201cprogress effectively\u201d without special education, \u00a7 10-76d (b) and (c) manifest the unambiguous intent of the legislature that special education is mandatory only for children with disabilities and not for gifted students.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Indeed, there is not the slightest suggestion in the legislative history of the special education statutes that the legislature, in establishing a program of special education, sought either to define the parameters of the state constitutional right to a free public education, or to constitutionalize any particular kind of educational program for exceptional children.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> We are obligated, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>moreover, to uphold the constitutionality of a statute when we may reasonably do so in a manner consistent with the intent of the legislature. <em>Bartholomew </em>v. <em>Schweizer, </em>supra, 217 Conn. 675-76. In these circumstances, when neither the legislature nor the framers of our constitution have vested in gifted children any right to an individualized education program, we cannot conclude that the plaintiffs right to a free public education under article eighth, \u00a7 1, of the Connecticut constitution includes a right to a special education program.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b30-7\">The plaintiff next argues that the legislature\u2019s failure to mandate a program of special education for gifted children violates the plaintiff\u2019s rights under the equal rights provision, article first, \u00a7 1, and the equal protection provision, article first, \u00a7 20, of the Connecticut constitution. This claim is also without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-8\">The equal protection provisions of our state constitution require \u201cthe uniform treatment of persons standing in the same relation to the governmental action questioned or challenged.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>Reynolds </em>v. <em>Sims, </em>377 U.S. 533, 565, 84 S. Ct. 1362, 12 L. Ed. 2d 506 (1964); <em>Franklin </em>v. <em>Berger, </em>211 Conn. 591, 594, 560 A.2d 444 (1989). We recognize, however, that the legislature has broad discretion in the exercise of its power to legislate, and that \u201c[i]n areas of social and economic policy, a statutory classification that neither proceeds along <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>suspect lines nor infringes fundamental constitutional rights must be upheld against equal protection challenge if there is any reasonably conceivable state of facts that could provide a rational basis for the classification.\u201d <em>Federal Communications Commission </em>v. <em>Beach Communications, Inc., </em>U.S. , 113 S. Ct. 2096, 2101, 124 L. Ed. 2d 211 (1993); <em>State </em>v. <em>Reed, </em>192 Conn. 520, 531, 473 A.2d 775 (1984).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">The plaintiff acknowledges that the needs and abilities of gifted children and children with disabilities are sufficiently different that the legislature could reasonably have decided to treat them differently. He contends, nonetheless, that because the legislature has identified a characteristic common to both groups, namely, the need for special education in order to \u201cprogress effectively\u201d in school, gifted children and children with disabilities are equally entitled to receive a program of special education under the state constitution. This argument, however, ignores the concededly significant differences between the two groups of students that inform the legislative decision to mandate a program of special education for children with disabilities but not for gifted children. As long as the disparate treatment is, as here, rationally based, we may not judge the wisdom, desirability or logic of the legislative determination; <em>Heller </em>v. <em>Doe, </em>U.S. , 113 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>S. Ct. 2637, 2642, 125 L. Ed. 2d 257 (1993); <em>Federal Communications Commission </em>v. <em>Beach Communications, Inc., </em>supra, 113 S. Ct. 2101; even where the legislature has not expressly articulated the purpose or rationale underlying its enactment. <em>Nordlinger </em>v. <em>Hahn, </em>U.S. , 112 S. Ct. 2326, 2334, 120 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1992). We conclude, therefore, that our special education statutes do not violate the plaintiffs state constitutional right to the equal protection of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b24-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 10-76a provides in relevant part: \u201c(c) An \u2018exceptional child\u2019 means a child who deviates either intellectually, physically, socially or emotionally so markedly from normally expected growth and development patterns that he or she is or will be unable to progress effectively in a regular school program and needs a special class, special instruction or special services. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b24-11\">\u201c(e) \u2018Children requiring special education\u2019 includes any exceptional child who (1) is mentally retarded, physically handicapped, autistic, traumatically brain injured, socially and emotionally maladjusted, neurologically impaired, or suffering an identifiable learning disability which impedes such child\u2019s rate of development, which disability is amenable to correction or which rate of development may be improved by special education, or (2) has extraordinary learning ability or outstanding talent in the creative arts, the development of which requires programs or services beyond the level of those ordinarily provided in regular school programs but which may be provided through special education as part of the public school program. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b24-12\"> General Statutes \u00a7 10-76d provides in relevant part: \u201c(b) In accordance with the regulations of the state board of education, each local and regional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>board of education shall: (1) provide special education for school-age children requiring special education who are described in subdivision (1) of subsection (e) of section 10-76a. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b25-7\">\u201c(c) Each local or regional board of education may provide special education for children requiring it who are described by subdivision (2) of subsection (e) of section 10-76a and for other exceptional children for whom provision of special education is not required by law. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b25-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 10-76a (a) provides: \u201c \u2018Special education\u2019 means specially designed instruction developed in accordance with the regulations of the commissioner, subject to approval by the state board of education offered at no cost to parents or guardians, to meet the unique needs of a child with a disability, including instruction conducted in the classroom, in the home, in hospitals and institutions, and in other settings and instruction in physical education and special classes, programs or services, including related services, designed to meet the educational needs of exceptional children.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b25-9\">Section 10-76d-ll of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies directs each local board of education to \u201cestablish policies and procedures for developing, implementing, reviewing, maintaining and evaluating an individualized education program for each child requiring special education and related services. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b25-10\">Section 10-76a-l (k) of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies defines \u201c[individualized education program\u201d as \u201ca separate written plan for each child which shall be developed by a planning and placement team to meet the needs of each child requiring special education and related services.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b25-11\"> For purposes of this opinion, \u201cgifted children\u201d refers to those children identified in General Statutes \u00a7 10-76a(e) (2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b25-12\"> Deborah Broadley is Neil Broadley\u2019s mother.
