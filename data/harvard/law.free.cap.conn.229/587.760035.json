The named plaintiff, Maureen C. Tovish, suing on behalf of herself and her two minor children, filed a workers\u2019 compensation claim arising out of the death of her husband, Richard Tovish, on January 20, 1987. The defendants, Gerber Electronics and Home Insurance Company, disputed her claim on the ground that the decedent\u2019s death did not arise out of and in the course of his employment as that term is defined in General Statutes (Rev. to 1987) \u00a7 31-275.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The compensation commissioner found for the plaintiffs and awarded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>them benefits pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 1987) \u00a7 31-306.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The award was affirmed by the compensation review board and by the Appellate Court. <em>Tovish </em>v. <em>Gerber Electronics, </em>32 Conn. App. 595, 630 A.2d 136 (1993). We granted the defendants\u2019 petition for certification to appeal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">The Appellate Court described the facts found by the compensation commissioner. \u201cThe decedent, Richard Tovish, was employed by Gerber Electronics as an \u2018outside salesman.\u2019 Gerber Electronics has no office or place of business in Connecticut; its principal place of business is in Norwood, Massachusetts. The decedent maintained an office in the basement of his house in Monroe, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>which he used exclusively for Gerber business. As a traveling salesman, he was responsible for customers in western Connecticut and part of New York. He called Gerber daily and used his own phone and car to call and visit his assigned accounts. Although he was expected to maintain these accounts and to visit them regularly, he was not under a strict regimen of work hours and did not follow an explicit itinerary.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">\u201cOn January 20, 1987, snow was falling in Monroe. The decedent\u2019s wife, the plaintiff, was sick in bed, as was his eldest son. Local schools were closed. The decedent had breakfast and then went to his office to work, according to his usual routine. He told the plaintiff that he had to call on some customers and therefore was going to shovel the driveway. The plaintiff later observed the decedent shoveling snow. At the time, he was wearing the type of clothing he usually would wear when calling on customers. After shoveling, the decedent went into his bedroom and complained of chest pains. The plaintiff helped him get comfortable and called an ambulance. The decedent turned blue and was given cardiopulmonary resuscitation by ambulance personnel before being taken to the hospital, where he died later that day. The decedent\u2019s physician testified that the decedent had a history of high blood pressure and that shoveling snow can lead to cardiac arrest in an individual with that condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">\u201cOn the basis of these facts, the commissioner determined that the decedent died of a cardiac arrest caused by shoveling snow. He also determined that the only reason the decedent had been shoveling snow was to enable him to drive his car out of the driveway to call on Gerber customers, and thus the decedent had suffered a compensable injury.\u201d <em>Tovish </em>v. <em>Gerber Electronics, </em>supra, 32 Conn. App. 597-98.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>Although the defendants have sought correction of some of these findings of fact at every stage of their appeal, we declined to grant the part of their petition for certification that sought further review of these factual findings. We certified, instead, a single question of law addressed to the statutory consequences of this factual record, namely, whether, at the time of his death, the decedent was acting within the scope of his employment under \u00a7 31-275 or was engaged in a domestic preparatory activity outside the scope of his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">After examining the record on appeal and after considering the briefs and the arguments of the parties, we have concluded that the appeal in this case should be dismissed on the ground that certification was improvidently granted. The underlying issues have been fully considered in the opinion of the Appellate Court; <em>Tovish </em>v. <em>Gerber Electronics, </em>supra, 32 Conn. App. 605-608; and it would serve no useful purpose for us to repeat the discussion therein contained. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Murray, </em>225 Conn. 524, 527-28, 624 A.2d 377 (1993); <em>Fleet Bank of Connecticut </em>v. <em>Dowling, </em>225 Conn. 447, 449, 623 A.2d 1005 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">Our grant of certification was improvident because we find ourselves unable to draw a bright line distinction, for all cases of sales persons based at in-home offices, between activities in the course of employment and activities that are merely preparatory to the course of employment. The law of workers\u2019 compensation is uniquely statutory. Until the legislature formulates appropriate guidelines, or our courts have adjudicated a sustained series of cases from which appropriate guidelines may be judicially derived, the better part of valor is to limit consideration of these questions to the specific facts of the individual case. The Appellate Court undertook that task in its opinion in this case. We decline to go further at this time. See <em>L. &amp; L. Builders, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number><em>Inc. </em>v. <em>Parmalee, </em>221 Conn. 203, 206, 602 A.2d 1016 (1992); <em>Booth </em>v. <em>Flanagan, </em>220 Conn. 453, 455, 599 A.2d 380 (1991); <em>Lawler </em>v. <em>Lawler, </em>212 Conn. 117, 119, 561 A.2d 128 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b610-11\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1987) \u00a7 31-275 provides in relevant part: \u201cdefinitions.
