The complaint alleged that the Supreme Court of Washington denied appellant\u2019s request for the appointment of counsel to present his petition for habeas corpus, although permitting counsel for respondent to appear and argue; and that the Supreme Court of Washington sustained a \u201cdemurrer\u201d to appellant\u2019s petition although Rule 7(c) of the Washington Rules of Civil Procedure had abolished \u201cdemurrers.\u201d The District Court directed the Clerk to file the complaint without payment of fees but denied appellant\u2019s motion to proceed in forma pauperis on the ground that the action was frivolous. We interpret the District Court\u2019s order as a denial of the motion for leave to commence the action in forma pauperis, and its order permitting the complaint to be \u201cfiled\u201d as intended simply to provide a complete record of the action taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-22\">The District Court \u201cmay\u201d authorize the commencement of a civil action in forma pauperis, and thereafter \u201cmay dismiss the case * * * if satisfied that the action is frivolous.\u201d 28 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 1915(a), (d). It follows that the District Court was authorized to deny leave to proceed in forma pauperis at the outset if it appeared from the face of the proposed complaint that the action was frivolous. Cf. Loum v. Underwood, 262 F.2d 866 (6th Cir. 1959); Taylor v. Steele, 191 F.2d 852 (8th Cir. 1951); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>Huffman v. Smith, 172 F.2d 129 (9th Cir. 1949). This authority is to be exercised with great restraint, and generally only where it would be proper to dismiss the complaint sua sponte before service of process if it were filed by one tendering the required fees. See Harmon v. Superior Court, 307 F.2d 796 (9th Cir. 1962). This was such a case.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\">Appellant\u2019s motion in this Court for \u201cdefault judgment\u201d is denied. The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
