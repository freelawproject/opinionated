He was advised of his rights under the Fifth Amendment, and thereupon refused to answer, relying upon his constitutional privilege against self-incrimination, when asked if he had been investigated by the Massachusetts Crime Commission in 1957 and whether he had in 1955 appealed to the Massachusetts Public Utilities Commission because the telephone company had refused to install twelve telephones in his office, and when asked many other questions. He frequently left the grand jury room to consult with counsel in the corridor, but refused to answer any questions, except for a few questions as to his height, weight, age, and marital status, concerning which he added the comment that in his or his counsel\u2019s opinion such questions were not germane to the inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-11\">The questions asked plainly showed that the inquiry was concerned, <em>inter alia, </em>with unlawful use of telephones to transmit gambling information.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-12\">Government counsel on the same date applied to the Court, for an order directing the witness to answer questions, in exchange for the immunity conferred by 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 409(i), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-13\">\u201cNo person shall be excused from attending and testifying or from producing books, papers, schedules of charges, contracts, agreements, and documents before the Commission, or in obedience to the subpena of the Commission, whether such subpena be signed or issued by one or more commissioners, or <em>in any cause or proceeding, criminal or otherwise, based upon or growing out of any alleged, violation of this chapter, </em>or of any amendments thereto, on the ground or for the reason that the testimony or evidence, documentary or otherwise, required of him may tend to incriminate him or subject him to a penalty or forfeiture; but <em>no individual shall be prosecuted </em>or subjected to any penalty or forfeiture <em>for or on account of any transaction, matter, or thing concerning which he is compelled, after having claimed his privilege </em>against self-incrimination, <em>to testify </em>or produce evidence, documentary or otherwise, except that any individual so testifying shall not be exempt from prosecution and punishment for perjury committed in so testifying.\u201d (Italics supplied)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b193-14\">This provision is Section 409(a) (i) of the Communications Act of June 19, 1934, 48 Stat. 1064, 1097, renumbered as Section 409 (i) by the Act of July 16, 1952, 66 Stat. 710, 722. The only variation between the two texts is that \u201cchapter\u201d is substituted for \u201cAct\u201d in the U.S.C. version. The provision is therefore applicable in any criminal proceeding involving alleged violation of the Communications Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>After hearing and argument, the \u25a0Court on April 17,1962, entered an order granting the application for immunization of the witness, who, together with the grand jury, appeared in open court \u2022on April 13, 1962, ,at which time the \u2022Court explained the situation and said, <em>inter </em>alia, \u201cMr. Marcus, I order you to .answer completely and truthfully all questions propounded to you in the course \u2022of you[r] forthcoming appearance before the grand jury.\u201d (Tr. 99; 40-A).</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">This language of the court is to be read in context with the request of the Government attorney indicating the scope of \"the questions to be asked and of the inquiry itself. Above all it should be remembered that the dispositive factor as to the court\u2019s direction is that the questions which were actually asked of appellant were directly within the purview of \"the investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">Within less than an hour the attorneys were in Chief Judge Wright\u2019s chambers, reporting that the witness was still recalcitrant. To comply with the notice provisions of Criminal Rule 42(b), a hearing in open court was held at which the \u25a0Court permitted the reporter to read the questions and answers of the witness before the grand jury. This record \u2022showed that on being asked questions 'he refused to answer, after having repeatedly consulted counsel in the corridor. A hearing for trial on the contempt charge was set for the following \u25a0day.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">On April 19, 1962, Marcus was tried for contempt, without a jury. The reporter testified from his notes, reading \"the questions and answers before the grand jury. There was no other testimony, but Marcus contended that the immunity statute was inapplicable or unconstitutional. Judge Wright thereupon found the defendant guilty of contempt, and after the usual ritual [see Green v. U. S., 365 U.S. 301, 304-305 (1961)] imposed a six months sentence (indi-eating that within sixty days the sentence could be reduced if Marcus testified). The District Court denied bail pending appeal, but this Court, after a hearing before Chief Judge Biggs on the same day (and subsequently by order of April 24,1962) enlarged Marcus on $15,000 bail, with permission to return to Massachusetts. The matter is now before us on an appeal by Marcus from the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-10\"> Appellant\u2019s position is utterly without merit. It is elementary that a grand jury is an arm of the court, and that refusal to comply with an order of court directing a witness to answer proper questions before the grand jury is a contempt of court. Since the refusal was persisted in even when the witness was afforded a <em>locus poenitentiae </em>and brought before the Court, where the situation was explained fully to him, the refusal was a contempt committed in the actual presence of the court and punishable summarily and without a jury trial in accordance with Criminal Rule 42(a). Brown v. U. S., 359 U.S. 41, 49-51, 79 S.Ct. 539, 3 L.Ed.2d 609 (1959); Levine v. U. S., 362 U.S. 610, 617, 80 S.Ct. 1038, 4 L.Ed.2d 989 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b194-11\">A witness is of course entitled to his constitutional right under the Fifth Amendment. But if an immunity is granted him by statute, as extensive as his privilege (or, as here, more extensive) he may be compelled to testify. Brown v. Walker, 161 U.S. 591, 594, 597-601, 16 S.Ct. 644, 40 L.Ed. 819 (1896); Counselman v. Hitchcock, 142 U.S. 547, 585-586, 12 S.Ct. 195, 35 L.Ed. 1110 (1892); Hale v. Henkel, 201 U.S. 43, 67, 26 S.Ct. 370, 50 L.Ed. 652 (1906); Heike v. U. S., 227 U.S. 131, 141, 33 S.Ct. 226, 57 L.Ed. 450 (1913).</p>\n<p id=\"b194-12\"> The immunity conferred by the statute involved here, like that in Brown v. U. S., supra, is the automatic statutory consequence of compulsory testimony.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The immunity is as extensive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>as the testimony. The contention is groundless that the immunity conferred is limited to proceedings based upon or growing out of the Communications Act.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As stated in Brown, the reference to that Act \u201climits only the class of witnesses to whom the immunity will attach, not the scope of the immunity conferred.\u201d 359 U.S. at 47, 79 S.Ct. at 544, 545, 3 L.Ed.2d 609.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">Indeed the facts in the Brown case are so closely parallel to those in the case at bar that petitioner\u2019s appeal is well-nigh frivolous.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">Does appellant fall within \u201cthe class of witnesses\u201d to whom the statutory immunity under 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 409(1) attaches ? Plainly the answer must be in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">The class is described as being composed of persons compelled to testify \u201cin any .cause or proceeding, criminal or otherwise, based upon or growing out of any alleged violation of this [Communications] Act.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">Obviously a grand jury proceeding is a \u201cproceeding\u201d (\u201ccriminal\u201d in nature) under this language. Hale v. Henkel, 201 U.S. 43, 66, 26 S.Ct. 370, 50 L.Ed. 652 (1906); Levine v. U. S., 362 U.S. 610, 617, 80 S.Ct. 1038, 4 L.Ed.2d 989 (1960); see also 359 U.S. at 46, 79 S.Ct. at 544, 3 L.Ed.2d 609.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-17\">Was the proceeding one involving the Communications Act?</p>\n<p id=\"b195-18\">Obviously the grand jury under its general powers could investigate within a wide field, dealing with violations of many statutes, including the Communications Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-19\">But the authorization appointing Joseph Corey as a Special Attorney and authorizing him to take part in grand jury proceedings in the District of Delaware referred specifically to \u201cthe Federal Communications Act, transmission of gambling information\u201d and kindred offenses. When Mr. Corey came into court on April 2, 1962, he informed the Court that: \u201cThe grand jury is inquiring into violations under statute [18 U.S.C.] 1084, under the transmission of interstate wagering information; also under * * [various other statutes including] the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>Federal Communications Act, if I haven\u2019t already mentioned it.\u201d (Tr. 2).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">The nature of the questions themselves which Marcus refused to answer plainly shows that unlawful use of telephone communication in connection with gambling and racketeering was involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">In the light of these specific declarations, the government could not later contend that the Communications Act was not within the scope of these grand jury proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">Of course there is no immunity earned until Marcus in fact testifies. So long as he refuses to testify he is still subject to prosecution, if the government can malee out a case against him by other evidence than his own. But so soon as he testifies, under compulsion of the Court\u2019s order, he automatically will receive immunity, from both federal and State prosecution, for any matter or thing concerning which he in fact testifies, so long as his testimony is not volunteered but is elicited by questions which the Court has ordered him to answer. This would include matters affecting his income tax liability or any other matters brought out as part of the grand jury inquiry. It is of course the task of the government attorneys to ensure that the witness is not given an immunity broader than is necessary and expedient to advance the important objectives of the grand jury\u2019s investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">One further argument advanced by appellant remains to be noticed. It is contended that the immunity provision of the Communications Act is repugnant to the terms and policy of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1084 which penalizes interstate transmission of gambling information. That legislation, it is said, aims at aiding State authorities in their task of repressing gambling. Therefore it is incongruous that action by a federal grand jury should have the effect of conferring immunity against State prosecution. Attention is directed by appellant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1084(c) which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-8\">\u201cNothing contained in this section shall create immunity from criminal prosecution under any laws of any State, Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, territory, possession, or the District of Columbia.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b196-9\">But it is plain that this provision merely declares that <em>\u201cthis section\u201d </em>[1 e., 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1084] shall not have the effect of conferring immunity from State prosecution. It does not derogate from the effects of <em>other </em>statutes (such as the Communications Act and many others) which <em>do </em>confer immunity. Where immunity is so granted, of course by virtue of the Supremacy Clause it supersedes and takes precedence over State law and policy with respect to prosecution of gamblers. Reina v. U. S., 364 U.S. 507, 511-512, 81 S.Ct. 260, 5 L.Ed.2d 249 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-10\">In his reply brief (p. 13) appellant contends that his \u201ccompelled testimony presumably would be turned over to the states to enable the states to prosecute other persons who may have violated the states\u2019 gambling laws.\u201d This if so would be none of appellant\u2019s concern. His constitutional rights under the Fifth Amendment, and the corresponding immunity derived therefrom, cannot be used by him to protect other parties. Hale v. Henkel, 201 U.S. 43, 69, 26 S.Ct. 370, 50 L.Ed. 652 (1906); Rogers v. U. S., 340 U.S. 367, 371, 71 S.Ct. 438, 95 L.Ed. 344 (1951). For example, the grand jury might well have occasion to indict a telephone company for various possible violations of the Communications Act growing out of service furnished to appellant in connection with gambling activities. But appellant would have no legal right to hinder or obstruct such action. He is not entitled by the Constitution to claim the privilege of silence in order to shield his associates or those with whom he has had dealings.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-11\">There is no merit in any of the arguments advanced by appellant. The judgment of the District Court will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b194-7\">. The immunity provision of the Communications Act is self-executing, unlike the provisions of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3486 or 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1408, where obtaining a court order is a necessary condition precedent to the grant of immunity. UUman v. U. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>S., 350 U.S. 422, 431-433, 76 S.Ct. 497, 100 L.Ed. 511 (1956); Reina v. U. S., 364 U.S. 507, 509, 81 S.Ct. 260, 5 L.Ed.2d 249 (1960). If, as appellant alleges, the District Court here has no statutory jurisdiction (in analogy to the procedure under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3486) to make the order of April 17, 1962, the consequence is merely that such order is surplusage and the conviction is to be sustained for violation of the order of April 18, 1962, which the Court had inherent power to make regardless of statutory authorization. There was also power under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 401 to punish for this type of contempt.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b195-11\">. Equally unfounded is appellant\u2019s assumption that his testimony must be limited to violations of that Act, and that the Court should not have directed him to answer <em>all </em>questions. A witness cannot control the scope of a grand jury investigation or challenge the relevancy of questions asked. Hale v. Henkel, 201 U.S. 43, 65, 26 S.Ct. 370, 50 L.Ed. 652 (1906); Nelson v. U. S., 201 U.S. 92, 115, 26 S.Ct. 358, 50 L.Ed. 673 (1906).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b195-14\">. Perhaps the appellant in Brown had a stronger case than here, because the immunity provision of the Interstate Commerce Act is contained in Part I thereof, and was made applicable to Part II thereof by incorporation by reference. See 359 U.S. at 44, 79 S.Ct. at 543, 3 L.Ed.2d 609. The immunity provision of the Communications Act is direct and self-contained. Since in Brown, as here, a claim of privilege was made <em>in limine, </em>nothing turns on the distinction between pre-1933 immunity provisions such as that in the Interstate Commerce Act and those like 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 409 (l). See U. S. v. Monia, 317 U.S. 424, 429-430, 63 S.Ct. 409, 87 L.Ed. 376 (1943); and Smith v. U. S., 337 U.S. 137, 147-148, 69 S.Ct. 1000, 93 L.Ed. 1264 (1949). In the case of statutes of the latter type, the scope of the immunity' is determined by acceptance of the witness\u2019s claim for immunity at the time it is made. U. S. v. Onassis, 125 F.Supp. 190, 201 (D.C.1954).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b195-22\">. Hence it is the \u201cproceeding\u201d, not necessarily the indictment or indictments resulting therefrom, which must be based upon the Communications Act. The indictments might deal with income tax violations, conspiracy charges, or various other offenses.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
