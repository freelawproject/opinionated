Ryan then notified Hudson-Thames as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-25\">\u201cIt is with deep regret that I so inform you we do not want you to represent Ryan Stevedoring Company, Inc., in any further negotiations in regard to the bauxite movement into Gulfport. It appears to us that the lowest price quoted to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>Ayrton Metal &amp; Ore Corporation, Saguenay or the G.S.A. will get the business, and that is the reason we have taken the above position.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b748-4\">Thereafter Ryan was the successful low bidder on a second contract for the discharge of bauxite at Gulfport.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">The sole question presented for decision is whether Ryan could terminate its agreement with Hudson-Thames and not be liable for commissions as to the contract on which Ryan was the lowest competitive bidder. In a full and well-reasoned opinion, published in 210 F. Supp. 118, the district court answered that question in the affirmative. After careful consideration of the record and briefs and arguments, we find ourselves in full agreement with the district court, and on the basis of* its opinion, the judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
