There is substantial evidence in the record to support the findings of the Trial Exam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"879\">*879</page-number>iner and the decision of the Board and we find the order of the Board, which directed that the employees be made whole for any losses which they may have suffered by reason of their discharge prior to April 30, 1961, to be an appropriate remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-5\">Accordingly we deny the petition to review the order of the Board and grant the cross-petition of the Board for enforcement of its order.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
