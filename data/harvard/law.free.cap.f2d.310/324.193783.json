Her action is for the personal injuries thus sustained. It is her contention that the fire was caused by a defective heater in the \u201cden,\u201d an outside porch which had been converted into an enclosed room. The jury found for the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-23\"> The case was fairly tried below and the jury\u2019s verdict was amply supported by the evidence. The several claims raised-by plaintiff on this appeal are obviously unfounded. Thus there is no basis for her request to charge that she could not have been guilty of contributory negligence, her claim for workman\u2019s compensation having failed because of her ineligibility therefor. Further, Judge Byers did not err in refusing to permit the Building Code of Hempstead to be read into the record and in declining to charge that violation of the ordinance was evidence of negligence. Defendants\u2019 only possible violation of the Building Code was their failure to obtain a Certificate of Occupancy from the Building Department of the town; plaintiff\u2019s claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>of improper setting of the heater is not supported by a showing of any ordinance regulating that matter. Since the conversion of the porch into a den was completed a year and a half before the accident, it is difficult to see any possible causal connection between failure to obtain a certificate at that time and the outbreak of the fire. Thus the judge committed no error in excluding the Building Code and denying the requested charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
