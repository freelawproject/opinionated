Cady signed an agreement with them with respect to an \u201cElcona\u201d trailer, in which he and his family thereafter lived in the court. After Cady became bankrupt, his trustee sought authority to sell the trailer free of any \u2022claims by the Allens. The trustee contended that the agreement constituted <em>\u25a0a </em>conditional sale within \u00a7 61 of the New York Personal Property Law, McKinney\u2019s \u25a0Consol.Laws, c. 41 and that since it was not filed as \u00a7 65 of that Law requires, the Allens\u2019 reservation of property was void as against an attaching creditor, as therein provided, and hence, by virtue of \u25a0\u00a7 70, sub. c. of the Bankruptcy Act, as \u2022against the trustee. The Referee upheld this contention, and was in turn upheld \u2022by the District Court for the Western District of New York. We take a different view.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-10\">Section 61 of the New York Personal Property Law provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-11\">\u201c \u2018Conditional sale\u2019 means (1) any \u2022contract for the sale of goods under which possession is delivered to the buyer and the property in the goods is to vest in the buyer at a subsequent time upon the payment of part or all of the price, or upon the performance of any other condition or the happening of any contingency; or (2) any contract for the bailment or leasing of goods by which the bailee or lessee contracts to pay as compensation a sum substantially equivalent to the value of the goods, and by which it is agreed that the bailee or lessee is bound to become, or has the option of becoming the owner of such goods upon full compliance with the terms of the contract.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b361-16\">The agreement here at issue was drawn up by the Allens on the standard lease form of the Buffalo Real Estate Board. It contains provisions usual in leases, although the language is not altogether consistent, the word \u201crent\u201d being crossed out at one place and \u201cpayment\u201d inserted, and Cady being designated as \u201cpurchaser\u201d in one provision typed into the agreement though as \u201ctenant\u201d in others. The lease was for \u201cthe term of 24 Months (Only) to commence on the 21st day of November 1959, and to end on the 21st day of November, 1961, at eight o\u2019clock in the forenoon.\u201d The rental or \u201cpayment\u201d was to be $32.00 weekly. The instrument stated the demised premises to be: \u201cHouse Trailer \u2014 Model 1959-2 bedroom Serial No. 608 Make Elcona 50/10 ft.\u201d, and then continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-18\">\u201cCash Price plus overall charges, such as rent, finance, insurence and etc........... $5800.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AvH\">Payment for option priviledges shall be ... $ 250.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AXL\">The downpayment of said trailer shall be ... $1934.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AOv\">The weekly payment shall be............. $ 32.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Apd\">''Applied toward the downpayment per week shall be............. $ 17.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"av8-dedup-0\">Held as overall charges per week, such as lot rent finance insurence . $ 15.00\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b361-27\">Another typed-in clause, under the heading \u201cOption Agreement\u201d, said nothing about an option but provided that \u201cThe tenant must provide the owner of said trailer with 4 weeks notice of his inten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>tion to vacate same and all keys to the trailer must be turned into the office of The Allen Trailer Park and there will be no refund of money of any discription.\u201d Appended to the lease and cross-referenced to it was a paper entitled \u201cOption Agreement Between The Allen Trailer Home Sales and Purchaser.\u201d This conferred on Cady an option to purchase the trailer \u201cby adding enough to the initial deposit to make up the down payment (or to pay the trailer off in full) and in addition by satisfying the bank agreed upon by the parties hereto, that his credit standing is good enough that the said bank will finance the trailer and in addition by signing the conditional sales contract as offered by the bank.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">Until August 1960 Cady made the weekly payments of $32; he had been previously credited with the $250 for \u201coption priviledges\u201d. In addition the Allens collected 32^ a week for Erie County sales tax, with which, they say, Cady was to be credited if he exercised his option. They have now returned this.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">The sole question is whether the agreement comes within the definition of conditional sale in \u00a7 61 of N.Y.Personal Property Law, quoted above, which is a verbatim enactment of \u00a7 1 of the Uniform Conditional Sales Act. Since the agreement calls itself a lease, the first inquiry is whether it meets the test as to leases laid down by \u00a7 61(2). On its face it does not. Section 61(2) requires that the lessee contract \u201cto pay as compensation a sum substantially equivalent to the value of the goods\u201d.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> *Admittedly the \u201cvalue of the goods\u201d was $5800. The Allens say that Cady contracted to pay only $378, viz., the $250 for \u201coption priviledges\u201d and the $32 for four weeks that would be required once he gave notice of intention to vacate. If we were to think otherwise and read the lease as obligating Cady to pay the rent for the balance of the term less any avails obtained by the Allens after repossession, this obligation was at most for \u201cthe term of 24 Months (Only) * * *,\u201d and the maximum payments to which Cady was committed on any view would thus be some $3578. Even though this entire sum were deemed \u201ccompensation\u201d for the leasing of the trailer,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> it would be only 62% of \u201cthe value of the goods.\u201d This was surely not \u201ca sum substantially equivalent\u201d to $5800, and the referee's unexplained finding to the contrary was clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-10\">It has been uniformly held elsewhere, in accordance with the plain language of the statute, that a lease with an option to purchase is not within the Uniform Conditional Sales Act where, as here, the aggregate payments required of the lessee are not substantially equivalent to the purchase price. Automatic Voting Machine Corp. v. Maricopa County, 50 Ariz. 211, 70 P.2d 447, 116 A.L.R. 320 (1937); Oberan v. Western Machinery Co., 65 Ariz., 103, 174 P.2d 745 (1946); Western Material Co. v. Deltener, 64 S.D. 62, 264 N.W. 207 (1935). See also Breece Veneer &amp; Panel Co. v. C. I. R., 232 F.2d 319 (7 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>dir., 1956). Similarly, a bankruptcy court applying New York law has held an agreement with a purchase option to fall outside \u00a7 61 for the reason that the total required payments \u201cwould be about 53% below the List Price\u201d, so that the ease was unlike those \u201cin which it was demonstrated that an agreement called a lease was actually a conditional sales contract, for the reason that the total of all so-called rental payments equalled the selling price * * * \u201d In re Tompkins Bus Corp., 22 F.Supp. 322, 324 (E.D.N.Y.1938). The leading New York case under \u00a7 61, New York World-Telegram Corp. v. McGoldrick, 298 N.Y. 11, 21, 23, 80 N.E.2d 61, 65, 66 (1948), concerned an agreement where, as the majority found, \u201cthe tenant became obligated to pay for the entire cost of the personal property within ten years and well within the first term of the lease\u201d. In holding that this came within the statute, Judge Thacher relied on the fact that \u201cbefore the termination of the lease * * * the entire option price * * * would have necessarily been paid, and the lessee, within the definition of a conditional sale, would have had the option to become the owner without further payments.\u201d Accord, United States v. Voges, 125 F.Supp. 916 (E.D.N.Y.1959). And Judge Fuld\u2019s dissent stated that \u201ca lease of personalty containing an option to purchase is not treated as a conditional sale if the price largely exceeds the aggregate rentals payable thereunder,\u201d and took issue only with the majority\u2019s factual conclusion that the lessee was actually obliged to make payments large enough to pay the entire purchase price during the term of the lease. 298 N.Y. at 25-26, 80 N.E.2d at 67-68.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">The Referee cited and relied on American Can Co. v. United States Canning Corp., 12 Misc.2d 750, 170 N.Y.S.2d 727 (1958), which held \u00a7 61(2) to comprehend a lease renewable annually by the Lessee, with a purchase option whereby past rentals would be credited against the purchase price, although the rentals would not be \u201csubstantially equivalent to the value of the goods\u201d unless the lessee twice exercised its right of renewal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> But that decision was reversed by the Appellate Term on grounds that made it unnecessary for the-reviewing court to consider the correctness of this holding. 15 Misc.2d 549, 180 N.Y.S.2d 983 (1958), aff\u2019d without opinion, 9 A.D.2d 746, 193 N.Y.S.2d 986 (1959). Federal courts have not been reduced to such stultification in applying state law that, in determining how New York would construe one of the Uniform Acts, they must shut their eyes to the language of the statute, its construction by appellate courts of other states, and relevant statements by the New York Court of Appeals, and adopt a contrary interpretation because of such a decision by a Municipal Court judge. See West v. American Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., 311 U.S. 223, 237, 61 S.Ct. 179, 85 L.Ed. 139 (1940); King v. Order of United Commercial Travelers, 333 U.S. 153, 161, 68 S.Ct. 488, 92 L.Ed. 608 (1948); Bernhardt v. Polygraphic Co. of America, 350 U.S. 198, 204-205, at 209, 76 S.Ct. 273, 277, at 279, 100 L.Ed. 199 (Mr. Justice Frankfurter concurring) (1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">It would be -surprising if the agreement between Cady and the Allens, although not falling within the second category of \u00a7 61, which was specifically designed to deal with contracts \u201cfor the bailments or leasing of goods,\u201d as this purported to be, nevertheless came within the first category as a \u201ccontract for the sale of goods.\u201d It does not. The first subdivision of the section applies only if \u201cthe property in the goods is to vest in the buyer at a subsequent time upon the payment of part or all of the price, or upon the performance of any other condition or the happening of any contingency.\u201d When the statute says \u201cis to vest,\u201d it means a vesting which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>contract requires both seller and buyer to accomplish, not one which the buyer has an option to demand if he does something he is not obliged to do. As said in 2 Williston, Sales (rev. ed. 1948), at p. 299:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-4\">\u201cIt is however essential in order to make a conditional sale in the sense in which that term is used ordinarily in statutes or elsewhere, that the buyer should be bound to take title to the goods, or at least to pay the price for them.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">New York World-Telegram Corp. v. Mc-Goldrick, supra, states it to be requisite to a conditional sale that the vendee of the chattel be \u201cobligated to pay for it.\u201d Indeed, the statute itself, N.Y.Personal Property Law, \u00a7 63, provides \u201cthe buyer shall be liable to the seller for the purchase price * * *.\u201d Here, so far as the agreement shows, Cady had an option, but not an obligation, to obtain \u201cthe property in the goods,\u201d either through paying the full price or, once he had been credited with $1934 against the downpayment, by getting a bank to finance the balance; in the latter event, \u201cthe property in the goods\u201d would vest, not in Cady, but in the bank, which would then execute a \u201cconditional sales contract\u201d with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">Despite all this the Referee thought the agreement, which he characterized as \u201can unorthodox instrument at its best, very confusing, inconsistent and ambiguous,\u201d exhibited, when \u201cread in the light of the credible testimony of Cady, and stripped of its freakness,\u201d \u201cthe elemental skeleton of a conditional sale.\u201d Although the instrument would not win a prize for elegance in draftsmanship, we find no ambiguity that is critical with respect to the application of \u00a7 61 of the New York Personal Property Law. The-agreement would come within \u00a7 61(1)' only if there was a commitment to purchase, and within \u00a7 61(2) only if the lease was to continue until the compensation-paid substantially equalled the value of' the goods. However the instrument be-read, it did not contain either of these-essentials. With the agreement thus clear that Cady had no commitment to purchase and that the term of the lease-was only for two years, and without any sufficient claim of mistake, the parol evidence rule, adequately invoked by the Allens, forbade the consideration of testimony that would alter the contract in either respect. Evans v. Edelstein, 276 Pa-516, 120 A. 473 (1923); 9 Wigmore, Evidence (3d ed. 1940), \u00a7 2444. Compare Chapin v. Dobson, 78 N.Y. 74 (1879). Moreover, in none of the testimony given' by Cady \u2014 who, to say the least, found! himself utterly swamped in the legal seas-into which his bankruptcy had plunged him \u2014 -did he unequivocally assert that he-considered himself responsible for the full-price in the crucial sense of subjecting-himself to personal liability for the entire-unpaid balance even if he abandoned the trailer \u2014 an old-fashioned concept, no-doubt, and one that Cady seemed quite unable to understand.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Nor was there-any such finding by the Referee.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-9\">It would be hard to find a worse case-than this for straining to push the statu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>tory definition of \u201cconditional sale\u201d beyond its terms. Living in a trailer in a \u201ctrailer court\u201d is a long way from creating the appearance of ownership that exists in the possession of an automobile registered in the buyer\u2019s name, or of a refrigerator in a home, or of a business machine in an office or factory. The Allens also rented trailers without purchase options, and had initially rented one to Cady on that basis. So far as Cady\u2019s creditors were concerned, there would be no more appearance of Cady\u2019s ownership from his possession of a trailer in the Allens\u2019 camp under the agreement here in question than from his possession under an agreement for rental and nothing more. True, the unlikelihood of deception in these circumstances would not save the transaction if it came within \u00a7 61 of N.Y.Personal Property Law. But the trailer\u2019s peculiar location and relative immobility help to explain why the Allens, unlike someone dealing in automobiles or other movable personalty, of which the \u201cbuyer\u201d has a less restricted possession, could afford to use a contract that was neither an out-and-out conditional sale, under which the buyer obligated himself to pay the purchase price as such, or a lease-option agreement pursuant to which the rental payments substantially equalled the price. Since the Allens\u2019 contract did not fall within either of the statutory criteria, there was no basis for depriving them of their property and giving Cady\u2019s general creditors an unanticipated and undeserved windfall.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">The order is reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b362-6\">. The Commissioners tell us why this category was included, and what it was meant to encompass, 2 U.L.A., p. 3:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-7\">\u201cIt is well known that some sellers attempt to evade the conditional sale recording acts by calling the contract a \u2018lease\u2019 or \u2018hiring agreement\u2019 and providing for the payment of \u2018rent\u2019. Wherever these \u2018leases\u2019 are substantially equivalent to conditional sales, they should be subject to the same restrictions. This equivalency seems to exist when the buyer is bound to pay rent substantially equal to the value of the goods and has the option of becoming or is to become the owner of the goods after all the rent is paid. In such a contract \u2018rent\u2019 means the purchase price, and possession as \u2018lessee\u2019 means the possession of a buyer under an executory contract of sale. That the buyer, in some cases, has the option of becoming the owner and thus a sale is not sure to take place, is of but small importance, for, as a practical matter, the buyer will always be willing to accept ownership when he has paid the value * * * \u00bb</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b362-12\">. Only $2018 of the $3578 would have been applicable \u201ctoward the downpayment\u201d, the balance being \u201coverall charges * * * such as lot rent finance insurence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b363-8\">. The Municipal Court erroneously relied, as also did the Keferee here, on United States v. Voges, 125 F.Supp. 916 (E.D.N. Y.1954), which proceeded on the ground that there the purchase price under the option precisely equalled the rental payments which the lessee was obligated to make in any event.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b364-7\">. When asked on direct examination \u201cWas it your understanding that you had entered into a contract to purchase this trailer,\u201d, Cady answered, \u201cThat is right. With that kind of money why I would have to.\u201d When counsel for the Allens \u25a0inquired whether what he meant wasn\u2019t that he had \u201chopes of eventually exercising an option and paying for it and getting title,\u201d Cady responded, \u201cI will have to say no to that because I am not where a man can throw money away and just say well I am going in here for an adventure. This thing was to be a permanent thing and I was going to make it so.\u201d Again, when asked whether it was his understanding when he signed this coatract \u201cthat you were. merely leasing this trailer with an option eventually to purchase it?\u201d, he answered \u201cNo, I was buying it, I had signed a contract.\u201d However, the question asked by counsel for-the Allens, \u201cNow did you know as at matter of fact when you signed that contract that you could not be \u2014 if it became impossible for you to make payments that you could not be legally compelled to pay the entire amount of $5800?\u201d, was never answered, Cady saying, \u201cI didn\u2019t hear that one, don\u2019t understand it.\u201d We share Cady\u2019s difficulty-in understanding why he would want to-\u201cbe legally compelled to pay the entire amount of $5800\u201d as against having an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>option to purchase, with a commitment limited very likely to four weeks after giving notice and at most to two years from the date of the lease. A year before giving the testimony here recited, but after a previous hearing when, apparently, he had said something similar, Cady signed an affidavit in the office of the Al-lens\u2019 attorney, stating: \u201cDeponent states flatly and without any contradiction that this [the contract as written] was the agreement between the parties and there was never any intention to make a sale under conditional sales or chattel mortgage in the first instance.\u201d At the later hearing, Cady disclaimed this \u201cbecause as I said I don\u2019t understand these words and I don\u2019t want to put myself in the middle.\u201d Allen testified that he knew \u201cfrom past experience\u201d that he was not \u201cselling the trailer to him [Cady] pursuant to a conditional sales contract.\u201d To rely on testimony like Cady\u2019s to contradict the terms of an agreement would be to rest on quicksand; the case well illustrates the policy behind the parol evidence rule.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
