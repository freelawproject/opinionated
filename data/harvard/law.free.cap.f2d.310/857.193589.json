Plaintiff sought to establish a lien in the sum of $15,031.63 on the property involved, and to have such lien enforced in accordance with Title 38, \u00a7 110 et seq., D.C.Code (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b905-29\">Defendant, claiming an agreement with plaintiff under which the latter agreed to do certain work for the sum of $7,000, contended that he had made a payment of $4,000 on account thereof, and admitted liability in the amount of $3,000, which he professed willingness to pay. He denied liability for any extras or additional work which plaintiff performed.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-30\">After a lengthy trial, the court found that there was due and owing to plaintiff from the defendant the sum of $7,750, namely, that on the originally contemplated work defendant was in arrears to the extent of $3,000; and, for the extra <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>work performed, the court found the fair price to be $4,750, including a profit of 10% above cost. Judgment was entered for-plaintiff in the amount of $7,750, with the proviso that, if the judgment was not satisfied within thirty days, plaintiff might enforce his lien against defendant\u2019s property to the extent of $7,750. Plaintiff appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-4\">Our examination of the record convinces us that the findings of the District Court are not \u201cclearly erroneous.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Accordingly, it follows that the judgment of the District Court must be and is</p>\n<p id=\"b906-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b906-28\">.
