Respondent tells us such agreements are \u201ccommon.\u201d They are nonetheless illegal. N. L. R. B. v. Jarka Corp., 3 Cir., 1952, 198 F.2d 618; N. L. R. B. v. Lummus Co., 5 Cir., 1954, 210 F. 2d 377. The union\u2019s contentions that \u201ctheir union obligations required them to make these overtures,\u201d and that because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>the charging party then told the employer he would not come back when union men were available because \u201cI don\u2019t want any trouble,\u201d and so must be regarded as having \u201cvoluntarily ceased work,\u201d are without merit. The union plainly caused an employer to discriminate against an employee on the basis of his lack of union membership in violation of section 8(b) (2) of the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(b) (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\">Decree will be entered enforcing the order of the Board.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b737-17\">. The word \u201cagreement\u201d was put into a witness\u2019s mouth by respondent\u2019s counsel. We think on the evidence as a whole \u201cpoEcy\u201d or \u201cpractice\u201d would be more accurate. However, any difference is here immaterial.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
