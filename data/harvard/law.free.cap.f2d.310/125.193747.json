The trial court ordered that the said sum be \u201capplied against the outstanding income tax assessment of Michael Spinella and/or Ar-eola Lodges, Inc.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b173-19\">Appellant here contends that the said sum was derived solely from the assets of Spinella and that the trial court erred in directing that any part thereof be applied to the tax liability of Areola Lodges, Inc.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-20\">The Government, by a motion now filed in this Court, asks that the order of the trial court appealed from be vacated \u201c * * * [Sjince the actual language of the order may well seem to place the allocation at the immediate discretion of the Service, without judicial determination\u201d, whereas \u201cBecause of the conflicting claims * * * of the appellant and Areola Lodges, Inc. to the $75,000' proceeds of the Plantation Key sale, the Government suggests that the September 8, 1961 order of the court contemplated an ultimate allocation of the $100,000, following a determination of these claims by agreement or by adjudication\u201d, and also because \u201cA return of the case to the District Court is desirable, also, for the purposes of determining the validity, amounts and priorities of other claims to the fund\u201d, including a claim by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue for additional taxes for subsequent years.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-21\">We agree that the order must be vacated in order that all issues which are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>necessary to be determined as to the \u2022proper application of the funds in the hands of the Receiver may be resolved in the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">The judgment is reversed and the \u25a0case is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
