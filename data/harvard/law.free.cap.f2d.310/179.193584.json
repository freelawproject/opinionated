Jurisdiction existed below as to the injunctive relief sought (Subdivision (e) of Section 302, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 186(e)); and on appeal lies here (28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-10\">The declaratory relief sought rests on the provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2201 and 2202, so long as jurisdiction is conferred by 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 186(e). We consider and hold this controversy a real and substantial controversy admitting of specific relief through a decree of conclusive character, and not an opinion advising what the law would be on a hypothetical state of facts. Samuel Goldwyn, Inc. v. United Artists Corp., 3 Cir., 1940, 113 F.2d 703.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-11\">The action originally was one for an injunction only, filed by certain employers engaged in the lathing and plastering business in the State of California. These plaintiff employers had signed, in June 1959, identical collective bargaining agreements with defendant unions. Each agreed to abide by the terms of an agreement made on January 2, 1958, between defendant The Contracting Plasterer\u2019s Association of Southern California, Inc., and the defendant unions; and any new agreement between said last named parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-13\">Thereafter The Contracting Plasterer\u2019s Association of Southern California, Inc. and the defendant unions signed a new collective bargaining agreement. Some plaintiffs signed the new agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-14\">The new agreement contained the following provisions, in pertinent part, in Article VI:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-15\">\u201cB.

In the event no such agent or depository is named, said sums shall be paid to the Southern California Plastering Institute Trust for the benefit of the Labor-Management Relations Trust.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AQU\">Plaintiffs below urged that the three Trust Agreements mentioned (33, C and E, supra) were void, invalid and violative of the terms of the Labor Relations Act of 1947, as amended in 1959, in that: (1) they provided for payments by employers to representatives of employees of plaintiffs; (2) that moneys so paid were used for purposes other than those permitted under subsection (c) of \u00a7 302 of the LMRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-10\">As amended in 1959, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 186(c) (5)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which proscribed payments, contained an exemption \u201cwith respect to money * * * paid to a trust fund established * * * for the sole and exclusive benefit of the employees * * *, and their families and dependents * * * : <em>provided\u2019\u2019</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-13\">\u201cThat (A) such payments are held in trust * * * for medical or hospital care, pensions * * *, [workmen\u2019s] compensation * * * or insurance * * * or unemployment benefits or life insurance, disability and sickness insurance, or accident insurance; * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-20\">Section 302(c) (6) provides a second exemption' \u2014 \u25a0</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-21\">\u201c * * * with respect to money * * * paid by any employer to a trust fund * * * for the purpose of pooled vacation, holiday, severance or similar benefits, or defraying costs of apprenticeship or other training programs.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-24\">As to both exemption (5) and (6), supra, clause (B) of \u00a7 302(c) (5) was specifically made applicable, requiring that \u201cwritten agreements\u201d were essential, as well as \u201cequal\u201d representation between employers and employees in the administration of such fund, with an impartial umpire to be agreed upon in the event of a deadlock; for annual audits, and for open inspection of the accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-25\">Subsequent to the filing of the original complaint, a supplemental complaint was filed. It added a second cause of action for declaratory relief seeking to hold invalid the trust which had evolved, since the filing of the original complaint, by reason of the transfer to the trustee (a California non-profit corporation, The Southern California Plastering Institute, Inc.) of all the functions of the three trusts hereinbefore described.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-26\">According to the allegations of the supplemental complaint, the articles of incorporation did not designate the members of the corporation but the By-laws, adopted on February 13,1961, designated eight locals of various unions and two corporations representing employers as members. The voting rights of the members are divided as follows: Local 2 of the Operative Plasterers &amp; Cement Masons International Association, A. F. L., 3 directors; Local 194 of the same union, 1 director ; Local 400, 1 director; Local 489, 2 directors; Local 343, 1 director; Local <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>739, 2 directors; Local 838, 1 director; Local 42 of Wood, Wire and Metal Lathers International Union, A. F. L., 1 director; Contracting Plasterers Association of Southern California, 11 directors; Lathing and Metal Furring Contractors Association of California, Inc., 1 director.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">The answers of the defendants to the complaint and the supplemental complaint admitted the main facts, the existence of the original trust agreements and the assumption of its functions by the corporation in the collective bargaining agreement between the employers and the unions. The denials related merely to the validity and legality of the transaction. The answers to the s\u00fcpplemental complaint asserted that \u201cthe Southern California Plastering Institute, Inc. was in-cox*porated for the purposes set forth in said Articles of Incorporation and for the purpose of creating an entity whose acts, conduct and operations would not lie within the proscriptions of any of the sections of the Labor-Management Relations Act.\u201d Also that the original defendants: \u201care not now collecting monies from plaintiffs or other contractors; that the defendant Southern California Plastering, Inc. is the only defendant now authorized to collect money from plaintiffs or other contractors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">Union appellants state three questions are here involved:</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">1. Did Congress intend, by the exceptions in subdivision (c) of \u00a7 302 of the LMRA to limit the type of funds which could be jointly administered by labor and management?</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">2. Does a trust or corporation become a \u201crepresentative\u201d of employees, within the meaning of \u00a7 302 merely because one-half of the trustees of the trust and one-half of the directors of the corporation are appointed by a labor organization where the purposes of said trusts or corporation are limited to promoting the use of lath and plaster in the construction industry?</p>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">3. Are payments by employers to such trasts and corporations within the prohibition of (a) and (b) of \u00a7 302 ?</p>\n<p id=\"b230-9\">Appellants Employers and Southern California Plastering Institute agree <em>that </em>the first two questions hereinabove mentioned are those here involved. (An affirmative answer to the thix-d question raised above necessarily follows if questions one and two are answered affirmatively.)</p>\n<p id=\"b230-10\">Amicus Curiae National Bureau For Lathing and Plastering, Inc., a corporation, urges the same first two questions, and adds a fourth: \u201cWhether the District Court\u2019s intex*pretation of Section 302, if allowed to stand, results in a denial of due px'ocess, in that the interpretation renders the section void for vagueness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b230-11\">An Amici Curiae brief is also before us from Painting and Decorating Contractors of California, Inc., Painting and Decorating Contractors Association of Los Angeles, Inc., District Council No. 36 of the Brotherhood of Painters, Decorators &amp; Paperhangers of America, Los Angeles County Painting and Decorating Joint Committee, Inc. It urges that the district court\u2019s application of \u00a7 302 to the facts of this case is unconstitutional; inconsistent with the x\u2019emainder of the LMRA; and contrary to the express intent of Congress, and that the Southern California Plastering Institute is not a \u201crepresentative of employees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b230-12\">Appellees agx-ee as to the first question .raised by appellants, treat the second question in two separate arguments (as to the \u201cjoint trusts\u201d and the \u201ccox-poration\u201d), and raise a fifth issue: \u201cShould a corporate entity set up for the express purpose of evading the provisions of Section 302 be disregarded ?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b230-13\">We need not reach the fifth question raised by appellees, because in our view the earlier questions raised control the case. We therefore accept the union appellants\u2019 statement of the questions involved, plus the due process question.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-14\">We answer the first three questions so raised affirmatively, and the fourth negatively. Congress did intend to limit the type of funds which could be jointly administered; both the trusts and the coi-poration cx-eated here are \u201crep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>resentatives of employeesthe payments sought to be halted by plaintiffs are within the prohibition of \u00a7 302(a) and (b) of the Act, and not within the exemptions contained in \u00a7 302(c); and the district court\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 302 does not render the section void for vagueness, nor does it result in a denial of due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">Congress, in passing the 1959 amendments to the LMRA, acted, as appellees state, \u201cvery cautiously.\u201d Let us assume, arguendo, that the trusts originally created are not here involved, by mootness. We then have a corporation, Southern California Plastering Institute, Inc., organized, as the district court described it:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aqt\">\u201c * * * as a general non-profit corporation under the non-profit corporation law of the State of California. California Corporations Code, \u00a7 9000 et seq.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-8\">\u201cThe objects stated in the Articles of Incorporation were these:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AxS\">\u201c(a) To promote industry betterment and industry public relations for the lathing and plastering industry.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-10\">\u201c(b) To encourage harmony between labor and management within the lathing and plastering industry.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-11\">\u201c (c) To carry out appropriate programs of public relations for the general welfare and advancement of the lathing and plastering industry.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-12\">\u201c(d) To gather and distribute facts, data and other information relative to the use and benefits of lath and plaster in general for the use and benefit of its members, the lathing and plastering industry as a whole and for public dissemination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-13\">\u201c(e) To engage generally in any causes or objects similar to the foregoing in order to promote the lathing and plastering industry.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-14\">\u201c(f) To adopt By-laws prescribing the duties of the officers and agents of the corporation, the detail of its organization, the time and manner of its meetings, and any and all detail incident to its meetings and conduct and management of its organization.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-15\">\u201c(g) To do any and all things which a natural person may do necessary or desirable for the general purpose for which the corporation is organized.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-16\">\u201cThese objects are well within the purposes authorized by California law for non-pi\u2019ofit corporations. * * * &gt;\u00bb</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b231-18\">The district court then disposed of the question raised below by appellees as to whether the Southern California Plastering Institute, Inc. \u201c[was], engaging in the trust business without authorization.\u201d Such a question, ruled the district court, is one to be ruled upon only by the State of California.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-19\">\u201c[T]he State is the only power that can intervene to determine the truth of these allegations and take appropriate action, either by quo warranto or other authorized proceedings. California Financial Code, \u00a7\u00a7 3111-3132. We cannot usurp that State function under the guise of a declaration of rights.\u201d We agree.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b231-21\">We next compare the laudable purpose of the non-profit corporation with the restrictions contained in the LMRA as to what funds can be set up and used. Did the original three trust funds and the later corporation perform functions forbidden by the Act? We quote with approval from Judge Yankwich\u2019s decision below:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-22\">\u201cThe clause [\u00a7 302(c) (5) and (6)] is an exception to the general provisions of the section, the aim of which is to proscribe the payment by employers and receipt by employee representatives in industries affecting commerce of bribes, gifts and gratuities, and to control monies paid into union trust funds as \u2018war chests\u2019 or for other purposes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-23\">' \u201cAfter the adoption of the statute (Taft-Hartley) so many variant interpretations, allegedly drawn from its history, were asserted that Judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>Learned Hand in a dissent in a noted case, United States v. Ryan, 2 Cir., 1955, 225 F.2d 417, complained that he found \u2018it impossible to extract any safe principles\u2019. At page 427. The Supreme Court * * * granted certiorari in that case and its decision has become the guide to the meaning of the section. Especially insofar as it relates to the prohibition against payment to \u2018representatives\u2019 of the union. The entire clause as it stood before the 1959 amendment is printed in the margin [note].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-5\">\u201cThe important part of the Ryan decision, so far as it concerns this case, is contained in the following statement as to the scope of the exceptions: \u2018Nor can it be contended that in this legislation Congress was aiming solely at the welfare fund problem. Such a suggestion is supported neither by the legislative history nor the structure of the section. The arrangement of \u00a7 302 is such that the only reference to welfare funds is contained in \u00a7 302(c) (5). If Congress intended to deal with that problem alone, it could have done so directly, without writing a broad prohibition in subsection (a) and (b) <em>and five specific exceptions thereto in subsection (c), only the last of which covers welfare funds. </em>As the statute reads, it appears to be a criminal provision, malum prohibitum, which outlaws all payments, with stated exceptions, between employer and representative.\u2019 United States v. Ryan, supra, 350 U.S. 299, at page 305, 76 S.Ct. 400, at page 404, 100 L.Ed. 335. (Emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-6\">\u201cAs I read this extract it means just this, that subsection 5 is a declaration of the Congress that only welfare funds <em>coming within one </em>of <em>the five (now six) exceptions </em>are exempt from the sweep of congressional condemnation. Subsequent decisions of the Supreme Court confirm this view. [Emphasis by Judge Yank-wich.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-7\">\u201cIn National Labor Relations Board v. Cabot Carbon Co., 1959, 360-U.S. 203, 79 S.Ct. 1015, 3 L.Ed.2d 1175, the high Court upheld the ruling of the National Labor Relations Board to the effect that a \u2018committee\u2019\u2019 of employees which deal with employers was forbidden by the Act, despite-the insistence that \u2018to hold these employee committees to be labor organizations would <em>prevent employers and employees from discussing matters-of mutual interest concerning the employment relationship.\u2019 </em>360 U.S. at page 218, 79 S.Ct. at page 1024. (Emphasis added) To this the-Court answered: \u2018The principal distinction lies in the unfettered' power of the former to insist upon its-requests. [National] Labor Relations Board v. Jas. H. Matthews &amp;. Co., 3 Cir., 156 F.2d 706, 708. Whether those proposals and requests-by the Committees, and respondents\u2019\u2019 consideration of and action upon them, do or do not constitute \u201cthe usual concept of collective bargaining\u201d (256 F.2d [281], at page 285),. we think that those activities establish that the Committees were \u201cdealing with\u201d respondents, with respect to those subjects, within the meaning of \u00a7 2(5) [of the National Labor Relations Act].\u2019 360 U.S. at-page 214, 79 S.Ct. at page 1022.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-9\">\u201cIn Arroyo v. United States, 1959,. 359 U.S. 419, 79 S.Ct. 864, 3 L.Ed.2d 915, the majority of the court held that in enacting the section the Congress were concerned with corruption of collective bargaining through bribery of employees representatives by employers and \u2018with the possible abuse by union officers of the power which they might achieve <em>if welfare funds were left to their sole control.\u2019 </em>359 U.S. at page 426, 79 S.Ct. at page 868. (Emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-10\">\u201cI take these statements to mean that the <em>only </em>purposes for which joint administrative committees of employers and employees, <em>working with</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number><em>in the framework of the Labor Management Relations Act, </em>[emphasis by Judge Yankwich) could act were those coming within the exceptions. This interpretation is confirmed by the added statement contained in the opinion: \u2018Congress believed that if welfare funds were established -which did not define with specificity ~the benefits payable thereunder, a \u25a0substantial danger existed that such funds might be employed to perpe-frate control of union officers, for \u25a0political purposes, or even for personal gain. See 92 Cong.Rec. 4892-4894, 4899, 5181, 5345-5346; S.Rep. No. 105, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., at 52; \u25a093 Cong.Rec. 4678, 4746-4747. To remove these dangers, specific standards were established to assure <em>that welfare funds would- be established \u25a0only for purposes which Congress considered proper </em>and expended only for the purposes for which they were \u2022established. See Cox, Some Aspects \u25a0of the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947, 61 Harv.L.Rev. 274, 290. <em>\u25a0Continuing compliance with these standards in the administration of \u25a0welfare funds was made explicitly enforceable in federal district courts by civil proceedings under </em>\u00a7 <em>302(e).\u2019 </em>359 U.S. at pages 426-427, 79 S.Ct. at page 868. (Emphasis added) [note]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-8\">\u201cThe conclusion is reenforced by the statement in a later case, Lewis v. Benedict Coal Corp., 1960, 361 U.S. 459, 80 S.Ct. 489, 4 L.Ed.2d 442, which reads: \u2018The provisions of the collective bargaining agreement creating the fund included the express provision that \u201cthis Fund is an irrevocable trust created pursuant to Section 302(c) of the \u2018Labor-Management Relations Act, 1947.\u2019 \u201d Another provision specifies that the purposes of the fund shall be all purposes <em>\u201cprovided for or permitted in Section 302(c).\u201d </em>In this way the agreement plainly declares what the statute requires, namely, that the fund shall be used \u201cfor the sole and exclusive benefit\u201d of the employees, their families and dependents.\u2019 361 U.S. at pages 464-465, 80 S.Ct. at page 493.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-11\">\u201cAll cases interpreting this clause which have arisen since the decision in Ryan, supra, must be read in the light of its declarations and those contained in subsequent cases as to the scope of the limitations on the nature of trust funds. So read they warrant the conclusion that <em>the only </em>trust funds permitted are those in the six categories now contained within the exceptions. [Emphasis by Judge Yankwich.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-12\">\u201cIn the light of this, the contention of the defendants that the clause under discussion does not prohibit joint administration of trust funds, if they are established for other purposes than dealing with the employers \u2018concerning grievances, labor disputes, wages, rates of pay, hours of employment, or conditions of work\u2019 (29 U.S.C.A., \u00a7 152(5)) cannot be sustained.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b233-13\">Judge Yankwich then differentiated Conditioned Air &amp; Refrigeration Co. v. Plumbing &amp; Pipe Fitting Labor-Management Relations Trusts, D.C.Cal.1956, 159 F.Supp. 887, affirmed, 9 Cir., 253 F.2d 427, and Sheet Metal Contractors Association of San Francisco v. Sheet Metal Workers International Association, 9 Cir., 1957, 248 F.2d 307. He cited Copra v. Suro, 1 Cir., 1956, 236 F.2d 107, and Employing Plasterers\u2019 Association of Chicago v. Journeymen Plasterers\u2019 Protective &amp; Benevolent Society of Chicago, 7 Cir., 1960, 279 F.2d 92, as supporting his conclusions. He quoted from Mechanical Contractors Association of Philadelphia v. Local Union No. 420, 3 Cir., 1959, 265 F.2d 607:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-14\">\u201c \u2018Thus, the essence of Section 302 may be summarized as follows: No fund derived from employer contributions may be administered by persons designated by a union <em>unless the fund meets the standards set forth in Section 302(c) (5). Any employee-designee administering such fund not </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number><em>meeting the requirements of Section 802(c) (5) is a, \u201crepresentative\u201d within the meaning of Subsections 802(a) and (b). </em>As was stated in United States v. Ryan, 350 U.S. at page 305, 76 S.Ct. at page 404, \u201cif \u2018representative\u2019 means only the \u2018exclusive bargaining representative,\u2019 the explicit limitations on welfare funds in \u00a7 302(c) (5) may be easily evaded. Payments made directly to union officials, <em>or to other individuals as trustees, </em>would apparently be excluded from \u00a7 302. Thus, a narrow construction would frustrate the primary intent of Congress.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.).\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"aq-dedup-0\">and,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-4\">\u201c \u2018As was stated by Judge Hand in his dissenting opinion in United States v. Ryan, <em>2 </em>Cir., 1955, 225 F.2d 417,425, subsequently adopted by the Supreme Court, \u201cSince * * * the purpose of subsection (c) is to state exceptions to the preceding subsections (a) and (b), the payments that subsection (c) covers would fall within (a) and (b) except for the- exception.\u201d \u2019 * * * (Emphasis added)\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">The able trial judge then observed that the restrictive interpretation of \u00a7 302(c) (5) was aided by the addition of \u00a7 302(c) (6) in 1959 (73 Stat. 537) covering pooled vacations, etc. Costs of apprenticeship training had been held a lawful purpose in South Louisiana Chapter, Inc. v. Local Union No. 130 of the Int. Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, E.D.La.1959, 177F.Supp.432; that \u201cCongress * * * has been required to spell out its intent in order that courts will not strike down, as illegal, labor and management-agreements, such as the one in suit, which promote harmony in an industry and redound to the benefit of the employer and employee alike.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">But until Congress has spelled out such an intent, with respect to the activities specifically exempted, it is not the function of the courts to create additional exemptions. Such would be the result of a single court\u2019s belief as to what will or will not \u201cpromote harmony\u201d and \u201credound to the benefit of the employer and employee alike.\u201d This court can believe that Congress might well have, or even <em>should </em>have, provided additional exemptions, permitting the setting up of laudable trusts that are vital to the preservation of the economic position of both labor and management, yet this court cannot be the arbiter of what such exemptions should be. That is the duty and responsibility of Congress. As Judge Yankwich ruled: Congress proscribed certain practices and permitted others in labor-management agreements, and permitted \u201cjoint trust funds for certain purposes only.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b234-10\">It is perfectly true, as the union contends, that there is not the slightest hint in the record that any of the trust funds, here involved \u201chas resulted in bribes, kickbacks, slush funds, racketeering or union war chests; nor do [plaintiffs] assert that this fund is under the sole control of the union.\u201d We accept that statement, with gratitude and happiness that it is true. But that does not prove that the trust fund is \u201cnot within the scope of the evil which Congress intended to eliminate.\u201d We agree with appellees and Employing Plasterers\u2019 Association of Chicago v. Journeyman Plasterers\u2019 Protective &amp; Benevolent Society of Chicago, supra, wherein the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-11\">\u201cSection 302 is aimed primarily at the <em>prevention </em>of possible abuse and not at providing a remedy for abuse actually perpetrated. * * * Where it is established that payment and acceptance is between employer and \u2018representatives\u2019 of employees, the issue in a suit for injunction becomes the legality of the welfare funds <em>as measured by the statutory standards </em>of administration.\u201d (279 F.2d at 97.) (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b234-13\">Gibas v. United States, 7 Cir., 1962, 300 F.2d 836, 840.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-14\">Appellants urge that this \u201cgood purpose\u201d of the funds so paid was but of <em>indirect </em>benefit to the employees, and not to their direct benefit. We find in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>statute no language creating or recognizing such a distinction.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\">Judge Yankwich did not find it necessary to reach the differences between the powers and voting rights of the trustees of the original trusts, and those of the directors of the non-profit corporation. This because, in his opinion, the <em>purposes, </em>both of the trusts and the corporation, violated the collective bargaining agreement they were to implement.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">Are these trust funds, and more particularly, is this non-profit corporation, a \u201crepresentative\u201d of the employees of a labor organization? Appellants admit that the trade promotion funds herein involved are not within any of the exceptions of subsection (c) of \u00a7 302. But they earnestly urge that neither are such funds within the proscription of \u00a7 302(a) and (b) because the payments are not made to a \u201crepresentative of employees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">We agree with appellants that the factual situation here is not precisely com-' parable to that in the Sheet Metal Contractors Association case, supra, where the trustee, a Joint-Industry Board, aided disputes between labor and management arising from a collective bargaining agreement, set up arbitration committees, a forum to discuss the problems of the industry, and \u201ccooperated\u201d with \u201cpublic bodies\u201d with respect to legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">The Board in the Sheet Metal case, supra, had the authority and power \u201cto study and correct improper working conditions and shall decide all controversies or disputes arising under this agreement.\u201d This court concluded: \u201cThe purposes of the Board, indicate that it existed for the purpose at least in part of dealing with employers concerning grievances, etc.\u201d Our opinion presumed that \u201cany dispute\u201d between the parties to the agreement included \u201cgrievances,\u201d and concluded that the Joint-Industry Board satisfies the definition of \u201clabor organization\u201d contained in the original Wagner Act (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 152(5)).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Here there was undisputed employee participation in a plan. . If it existed, even in small part, for the purpose of dealing with employers concerning grievances or disputes, or conditions of work, it was then a \u201clabor organization\u201d within the 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 152(5) definition, and could be a \u201crepresentative\u201d within the 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 152(4) definition.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b235-11\">We now turn to the purposes of the corporation, and the antecedent trusts. Plaintiffs\u2019 Exhibit 2, \u201cAgreements and Declarations of Trust,\u201d indicates that six separate agreements were signed by the same parties on behalf of labor, and the same parties on behalf of management.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-12\">First: There was the \u201cSouthern California Plastering Institute Trust.\u201d It was the collecting agency for (a) the Insurance Trust; (b) the Industry Program; (c) the Pension Trust; and (d) the Labor-Management Relations Trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-13\">There was also (e) a Vacation Plan with a Vacation Fund Account to which amounts were payable under the collective bargaining agreements. The trustees of Southern California Plastering Institute acted as trustees for this fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-14\">As quoted above, the only trusts herein attacked were the Industry Program, the Institute Trust, and the Labor-Management Relations Trust. No question is raised as to the Vacation Plan, the Insurance Trust or the Pension Trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-15\">The agreements setting up the respective trusts were all made a part of the collective bargaining agreement, \u201cas though set forth in full.\u201d The Institute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>Trust had no purpose other than to act as a conduit for the moneys collected on their way to the other trusts.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-13\">Second: We find the Industry Program trust had certain stated purposes, functions and powers.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>The purpose was to promote \u201cindustry-betterment and industry public relations.\u201d The trustees were equally divided between the contractors and the union. (Art. Ill, B.) Under Article V, ft A, the trustees had full power to carry out, as they deemed appropriate, a program of public relations for the general welfare and advancement of the plastering industry. Under Article V, f\u00ed M, the trustees could employ counsel, and executive, administrative, clerical and secretarial help, and incur and pay any other expense reasonably incidental to the administration of the trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-12\">Under Article Y, f\u00ed G, the trustees had the power \u201cto enforce the payment of contributions to the trust by individual employers under the terms of the collective bargaining agreements or under any other promise to make such payments.\u201d Under Article V, tf J, the trustees had the power to require employers to submit any \u201cinformation, data, report or documents reasonably relevant\u201d to the administration of the trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-13\">Third: Under the Labor-Management Relations Trust created by the collective bargaining agreement, the functions and powers<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> of the six trustees (three ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>pointed by the unions, and three by the contractors) were \u201cto expend the funds * * * for the common interest of labor-management relations * * * for secretarial or reporter\u2019s services required for meetings of labor-manage<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>ment negotiating committees, for legal services and other costs * * * pertaining to said [Collective Bargaining] Agreement, and for other incidental costs and expenses of labor-management relations.\u201d The Trustees had under Article IV, f[ J, similar powers to those of the Industry Program Trustees mentioned above.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">It should be noted generally that in the Industry Program Trust three-fourths of the trustees constituted a quorum,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> but a majority of all trustees (not a majority of a quorum) governed \u201cin the determination of any matter.\u201d In the Labor-Management Relations Trust, five of the six trustees constituted a quorum,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> but a majority of all trustees (not a majority of a quorum) governed \u201cin the determination of any matter.\u201d Thus both labor and management maintained an absolute veto on any proposed action. Such procedure satisfies the requirement of employees\u2019 \u201cparticipation.\u201d No matter could be acted upon by either trust without \u201cemployee participation.\u201d We have already ruled in Sheet Metal Contractors Association v. Sheet Metal Workers, supra, that the term \u201cemployee participation\u201d must, like the term \u201crepresentative,\u201d be given a broad and inclusive meaning. Such an interpretation is required of us by United States v. Ryan, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"ak-dedup-0\">We note that this case was decided below largely on the written evidence produced by stipulation. Oral testimony was limited, and only addressed to the question of the amount of interstate commerce, a question not raised on this appeal. The court below, therefore, had no better opportunity than we have to scrutinize witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-14\">We conclude that the evidence in this case clearly establishes that the three trusts (Industry Program, Labor-Management Relations Trust, and the Institute Trust) as well as the succeeding corporate entity, are severally \u201crepresentative\u201d of employees as that term is used in \u00a7 302(a) and (b); and that the purposes, powers and functions of the trusts and corporation here involved are not within the exemptions created by Congress, and are not permissible objects for the use of joint trust funds.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b239-15\">We do not quarrel in the slightest with the laudable objectives of the trust amicably created by labor and management in this case. We sympathize with the efforts of both labor and management to solve a vexing industry problem. But like so many of such present day problems, our duty is to rule in accordance with that which the Congress (quote) in its wisdom (end of quote) has seen fit to enact. We cannot widen the door when the door sill has been carefully tailored by the representatives in Congress. The relief sought by the appellants herein must be found in congressional and not judicial action.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-16\">We <em>affirm </em>the judgment below.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b229-15\">. Article VI also contained paragraph A, relating to payments into an insurance program; paragraph D, relating to payments into a pension trust fund; and paragraph F, relating to a vacation plan.
