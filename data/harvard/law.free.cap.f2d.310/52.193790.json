The complaints which appellant makes concern the minutiae of the trial, which are matters for the sound judicial discretion of the trial judge. The court\u2019s refusal to give the charge requested by appellant with rs-spect to accomplice testimony was not erroneous; the charge given fairly instructed the jury as to the weight and credibility to be given such testimony.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We have considered the other errors urged and find all to be without merit. The judgment of the court below is</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b101-16\">. The requested instruction was that the accomplice\u2019s testimony \u201cshould be weighed with caution, distrust and suspicion,\u201d but the court felt the instruction given that \u201cyou should keep in mind with respect to this witness\u2019 testimony that it should be received with caution and weighed with care, weighed with great care. You should not convict the defendant upon the unsupported testimony of Frank Aderholt unless you believe that unsupported testimony beyond a reasonable doubt,\u201d was sufficient. That provision of the charge is lifted almost verbatim from Mathes\u2019 \u201cJury Instructions and Forms For Federal Criminal Cases\u201d 27 F.R.D., 39, 09 (1961): \u201cHowever, the jury should keep in mind that such testimony is to be received with caution and weighed with great care. You should not convict a defendant upon the unsupported testimony of an accomplice, unless you believe the unsupported testimony beyond all reasonable doubt.\u201d Cf. Emmanuel v. United States, 5 Cir., 1928, 24 F.2d 905; Lyles v. United States, 1957, 5 Cir., 249 F.2d 744; and Phelps v. United States, . 5 Cir., 1958, 252 F.2d 49.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
