Tabah, 2 Cir., 297 F.2d 731, 732. We are now asked to hold that insufficient evidence existed to support Judge-Palmieri\u2019s findings of participation by Bell Container Corporation in fraudulent transactions to supply containers and by Harold J. Simon in fraudulent transactions to supply trucking services to the milked corporation. The judge\u2019s extensive findings of fact and conclusions of law closely considered whether the various dealings of these two defendants with persons in fiduciary ca<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>pacities to Doeskin were in furtherance of <em>bona fide </em>business purposes and decided they were not. Judge Palmieri\u2019s findings were justified by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
