Appellant had' sought a writ of coram nobis from the-Superior Court of the State of Washington in and for Yakima County, the sentencing court. That court had denied relief upon the ground that eoram nobis would not issue where habeas corpus was available; that only the Supreme-Court of Washington or the Superior-Court of Walla Walla County, within, which appellant was imprisoned, had ha-beas corpus jurisdiction of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-24\">Appellant has never put the Yakima court\u2019s theory to the test. Habeas corpus has never been sought in the state-courts of Washington-. Nor do we understand that the Yakima court\u2019s doors-; are closed on coram- nobis, should appellant fail to secure- habeas corpus, since-that court never reached' the merits upon - the coram nobis question;</p>\n<p id=\"b740-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>Under these circumstances, the District Court below, in denying appellant relief, did so upon the ground that he had failed to exhaust his state remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\">We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
