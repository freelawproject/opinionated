The Trademark Trial and Appeal Board granted a motion for summary judgment by Stonecutter Mills and dismissed the opposition. Universal appeals from that action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-14\">The board granted the motion for summary judgment on the ground that the issues raised in the opposition are <em>res judicata, </em>because of a prior proceeding, viz., Cancellation No. 6771, in which Universal unsuccessfully sought cancellation of Stonecutter Mills\u2019 Registration No. 422,633<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of \u201cSTONECUTTER\u201d on the principal register for piece goods of rayon, wool and/or cotton.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-15\">The final decision in the prior proceedings, Universal Overall Company v. Stonecutter Mills Corporation, 121 U.S. P.Q. 605, reconsideration denied, 122 U.S.P.Q. 324, is that of the Assistant Commissioner. In the original decision it is stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1001-16\">\u201cThe record shows that since 1926, petitioner has used the term \u2018STONE CUTTER\u2019 as a trademark for men\u2019s work clothing. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1001-17\">\u201cRespondent was organized in 1920 under the name of Stonecut-ter Mills Corporation, and it has continuously operated under that name since that time. The sales value of respondent\u2019s piece goods had increased from $37,000 in 1921 to more than $17,000,000 in 1957. The chairman of respondent\u2019s board testified that \u2018STONECUTTER\u2019 has always appeared in one way or another on all shipments of its piece goods, and since the beginning of its operations, respondent\u2019s products have been known in the trade as \u2018STONECUT-TER\u2019 goods.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1001-18\">\u201cThe question to be determined here is whether or not petitioner\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"954\">*954</page-number>right to use \u2018STONECUTTER\u2019 (either as one word or two words) is superior to respondent\u2019s right with the result that the registration is inconsistent with petitioner\u2019s rights.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1002-4\">\u201cThe record is inconclusive with regard to respondent\u2019s earliest use of \u2018STONECUTTER\u2019 in a technical trademark sense,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> but it conclusively appears that \u2018Stonecutter Mills Corporation\u2019 has been continuously used since 1921 in connection with the extensive sales of respondent\u2019s piece goods. Such use of \u2018STONE-CUTTER\u2019 by respondent is sufficient to establish rights in the term, and since it has been so used since 1921, petitioner has failed to show that it has superior rights in the term. Therefore, damage to petitioner from the registration cannot be inferred.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1002-5\">\u201cThe record indicates, however, that there has been long concurrent use by the parties on specifically different goods without any evidence of confusion, and it may be that petitioner would, in a proper case, be entitled to concurrent registration, but that question is not here to be decided. * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1002-6\">On reconsideration, the Assistant Commissioner, in responding to an argument by Universal that it should prevail because it was first to use the mark in a trademark sense, commented as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AWL\">\u201cSection 2 of the statute sets forth the grounds for ex parte refusal of registration by the Commissioner. These grounds may be invoked by an opposer who can show that he will be damaged by registration of a mark sought to be registered. These grounds may also, in a proper case, be invoked in a cancellation proceeding, but only as general grounds to show damage from a registration already issued. The provisions of Section 2 are prospective, and the statutory language of Section 2(d) is not applicable to a cancellation proceeding.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1002-10\">In the same opinion, the Assistant Commissioner further stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1002-11\">\u201cIn the present case it was established that the rights of respondent in \u2018STONECUTTER\u2019 were at least equal to petitioner\u2019s rights in the word and that damage from the registration therefore could not be inferred.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1002-12\">In support of the allegation in its notice of opposition that it will be damaged by the registration sought, Uni-' versal asserts that it has used the trademark \u201cSTONE CUTTER\u201d on its clothing products since. 1926 and that, in Cancellation No. 6771, the Commissioner was unable to find that Stonecutter Mills had used \u201cSTONECUTTER\u201d <em>as a trade mark </em>prior to 1944. As another ground of opposition, Universal asserts that the registration should be refused because the allegation, in the application as originally filed, that Stonecutter Mills has used the mark since 1921 on goods defined as clothing or garments produced by it, was false.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-13\">In holding <em>res judicata </em>applicable, th\u00e9 board stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1002-14\">\u201cThe records reveal that the several questions raised by opposer in its present pleading pertaining to applicant\u2019s use and display of its mark were duly considered and rejected by the Examiner' of Interferences in the aforesaid Cancelation No. 6,771, it being determined therein that, as between the parties, the respondent (applicant herein) had superior rights in the term \u2018STONECUT-TER\u2019 and that petitioner (opposer herein) could not be injured by respondent\u2019s registration thereof. On appeal, the Assistant Commissioner affirmed the Examiner\u2019s holding on the question of superior rights and did not disturb his rulings on the other questions involved.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1003-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"955\">*955</page-number>\u201cSince the present opposition and the aforesaid cancelation proceedings manifestly involve the identical question of damage to Universal Overall Company arising out of registration of the term \u2018STONECUT-TER\u2019 to Stonecutter Mills Corporation, the final adjudication in the prior proceeding is considered to be res judicata and binding on opposer herein.\u201d See: Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Sunnen, [333 U.S. 591, 68 S.Ct. 715, 92 L.Ed. 898], 77 U.S.P.Q. 29 * * *; American Fruit Growers, Inc. v. John Braadland, Ltd. [45 F.2d 443], 7 U.S.P.Q. 261 (CCPA, 1930); Westgate-Sun Harbor Company v. Watson, Comr. Pats. [206 F.2d 458], 97 U.S.P.Q. 523 (CA DC, 1953); Fourco Glass Company v. Libbey-Owens-Ford Glass Company, 115 U.S.P.Q. 191 (Comr., 1957); and The Arnold Milling Company v. Thorobred Company, Inc., 82 U.S.P.Q. 436 (Comr., 1949).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1003-6\">Universal urges that the board erred in finding the doctrine of <em>res judicata </em>applicable because the present opposition raises issues of fact and law which are different from those determined in the cancellation proceedings. The differences in fact it advances are, in substance, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1003-7\">\u201c1. The issue of the alleged falsity of the assertion in the present application, as originally filed, with respect to the use of the mark since 1921 on clothing or garments is new since the application was not filed until after the Assistant Commissioner's original decision in Cancellation No. 6771.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1003-8\">\u201c2. The date of 1921, alleged for first use in the application is not the same as the date found in the cancellation for Stonecutter Mills\u2019 first use of \u2018STONECUTTER\u2019 in a trademark sense, the latter date being asserted by Universal to be 1944, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1003-9\">\u201c3. The designation of the goods in Registration No. 422,633, involved in the cancellation is different from that in the application.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1003-10\">Universal further urges that the statutory provisions which govern cancellation proceedings are different from those governing opposition proceedings. In support of that contention, it refers to the statements of the Assistant Commissioner on reconsideration regarding the significance of Section 2(d) to opposition and cancellation proceedings, quoted above.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-11\">Stonecutter Mills refers to the cancellation proceedings as \u201cinvolving the very same two trademarks and merchandise here involved\u201d and asserts that the decision therein including rulings as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1003-12\">\u201c(1) that Stonecutter Mills Corporation [applicant] has superior rights in \u2018Stonecutter,\u2019 dating back to 1921, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1003-13\">\u201c(2) that Universal Overall Company [opposer], therefore, cannot be damaged by registration of \u2018Stone-cutter\u2019 in favor of Stonecutter Mills Corporation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1003-14\">It is obvious that the designation of goods and date of first use set out in the present application differ from the registration of Stonecutter Mills involved in the cancellation proceedings as pointed out by Universal. It is also evident that the contention that the application included false assertions as filed was not at issue in the cancellation proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-15\">The board did not discuss those obvious differences between the cancellation proceedings and the present opposition in its original opinion, nor did it discuss them in its decision on reconsideration, even though they were specifically pointed out by Universal. While the board\u2019s conclusion that <em>res judicata </em>is applicable indicates that that body did not consider the differences to be significant, we have not been given the benefit of the reasons it took that view.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-16\">On the basis of the \u25a0 record and the arguments before us we think the board erred. Applying the principles set out in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"956\">*956</page-number>Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Sunnen, 333 U:S. 591, 68 S.Ct. 715, 92 L.Ed. 898, cited by the board and parties here, it is apparent that all the questions of fact and law involved here were not determined in the previous proceedings. Determining whether Registration No. 422,633 should be cancelled did not settle the question involvedln the present matter, viz., whether applicants are entitled to registration of* their new application with its different designation of goods and its assertion of a different date for first use.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-4\">The decision in the cancellation proceeding did not include a finding that the date of first use asserted in the application, 1921, is correct or that Stone-cutter Mills used the mark as a trademark prior to opposer so using it. On the contrary, that decision ruled that the record \u201cis inconclusive with regard to respondent\u2019s [Stonecutter Mills\u2019] earliest use of \u201cSTONECUTTER\u201d in a technical trademark sense.\u201d The discussion in the opinion on cancellation of the possibility that a case for concurrent use might exist, with the express statement that the question was not \u201chere to be decided\u201d indicates the Assistant Commissioner did not regard that decision as settling any rights of the parties beyond those necessary to determine the cancellation question.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-5\">Universal\u2019s charge that the allegation of use of the mark on clothing, made in the application as originally filed, is false, was obviously not settled by the cancellation proceedings. Thus, the holding of <em>res judicata </em>was not not proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-6\">It appears that at this time no useful purpose would be served by discussing the applicability of Section 2(d) to cancellation and opposition proceedings, raised by Universal. Hence we express no opinion on that matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-7\">The decision is <em>reversed </em>and the case <em>remanded </em>to the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-8\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1001-19\">. The application, Serial No. 79,125, as originally filed on August 6, 1959, designated the goods as \u201cmen\u2019s, women\u2019s, and children\u2019s clothing, including shirts, slacks, dresses, skirts, blouses, sportswear and other similar articles of clothing.\u201d Subsequently, the application was amended to specify \u201ctextile fabrics of cotton, silk, rayon and/or other manufactured fibers and combinations thereof for use in garments for men, women and children, including blouses, dresses, shirts [sic], jackets, jeans, lingerie, shirts, ties, slacks, shorts and sportswear, and for use in home furnishings [sic] items such as draperies, curtains, bedspreads and up-liolstery fabrics.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"agn-dedup-0\">.
