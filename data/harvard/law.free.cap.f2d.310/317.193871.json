Although entitled as above, the relief sought here is in essence a reversal of the District Court of the Southern District of Ohio, in its denial of appellant\u2019s motion for a new trial on grounds of newly discovered evidence under Rule 33, Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, Title 18 USCA; see Zachary v. United States, 275 F.2d 793, at 796 (C.A.6) 1960, cert. denied, 364 U.S. 816, 81 S.Ct. 46, 5 L.Ed.2d 47;</p>\n<p id=\"b366-9\">AND IT APPEARING that the motion was seasonably filed within two years of final appellate judgment, Williams v.

United States, supra;</p>\n<p id=\"b366-12\">IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the motion to vacate judgment and sentence be denied and that the order of the District Court denying the motion for a new trial be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
