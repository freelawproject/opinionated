Appellant, in addition to other relief, was awarded damages in the total amount of $250 as a result of the infringement in lieu of actual damages and profits.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-25\">The appeal is from that part of the final judgment limiting the amount of damages to $250, appellant contending that the District court erred in failing and refusing to award damages in an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>amount not less than $250 nor more than $5,000 for each of the thirteen separate and distinct copyrights which the court found to be infringed. The appeal is meritorious. The governing statute is clear.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">The Supreme Court has so held in a multiple-copyright infringement case, L. A. Westermann Company v. Dispatch Printing Company, 1919, 249 U.S. 100, 73 S.Ct. 225, 97 L.Ed. 280, and has also held that the discretion of the trial court in assessing such damages as appear just is limited by the statutory minimum of $250 and maximum of $5,000. Westermann, supra; JewellLaSalle Realty Company v. Buck, 1931, 283 U.S. 202, 73 S.Ct. 226, 97 L.Ed. 281; Douglas v. Cunningham, 1935, 294 U.S. 207, 73 S.Ct. 224, 97 L.Ed. 280; and F. W. Woolworth Company v. Contemporary Arts, Inc., 1952, 344 U.S. 228, 73 S.Ct. 222, 97 L.Ed. 276. Recent cases involving the award of damages in multiple-copyright infringement cases, and where the teachings of the Supreme Court were followed are Edwin H. Morris &amp; Company v. Burton, E.D.La., 1961, 201 F. Supp. 36, Inter-City Press, Inc. v. Siegfried, W.D.Mo., 1958, 172 F.Supp. 37; and Local Trademarks, Inc. v. Grantham, D.C.Neb., 1957, 166 F.Supp. 494.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">While we would ordinarily remand with the direction that the District Court fix damages within the statutory limits, it will not be necessary here because counsel for Appellant has agreed that the Appellant will accept the statutory minimum of $250.00 for each of the thirteen copyrights infringed. Appellant will therefore be entitled only to $250 for each of the thirteen copyrights infringed. We reverse and remand so that judgment may be entered accordingly.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b696-6\">.
