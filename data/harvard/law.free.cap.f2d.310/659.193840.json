The Board\u2019s decision is reported at 133 NL RB p. 1501 (Oct. 30, 1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-9\">The case involves an attempt by the Wholesale Delivery Drivers and Salesmen\u2019s Union, Local No. 848, to force several retail markets to cease doing business with petitioner with whom the Union was having a labor dispute. It was charged that the Union activity was proscribed by \u00a7 8(b) (4) (i) (ii) (B) of the National Labor Relations Act, as amended 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(b) (4) (i) (ii) (B).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b708-17\">The primary facts are not in dispute. Petitioner is a wholesale distributor of specialty merchandise such as candy, liquor, holiday supplies and specialty articles in the area of Los Angeles, California. Included in such merchandise are brand name products, i. e., GOOD SEASON SALAD DRESSING and OLD LONDON PRODUCTS. Kory\u2019s Markets, Inc., McDaniels Markets and Daylight Markets (herein referred to as Kory, McDaniels and Daylight) separately operate chain retail food supermarkets in the area of Los Angeles, California. All of such markets regularly and customarily purchase, handle, stock and sell products distributed by petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-18\">In early February, 1960, as a result of a labor dispute with petitioner, the above named Union engaged in a strike against petitioner and picketed petitioner\u2019s warehouse located in Los Angeles. From February 3rd through March 10th, 1960, the Union, in aid and support of its strike <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>against petitioner, engaged in a campaign to enlist the aid and cooperation of Kory, McDaniels and Daylight to cease doing business with petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-4\">In its efforts to win the labor dispute with petitioner, agents of the Union engaged in the following conduct and practices :</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">1. Told the manager of McDaniels Market No. 14 that the Union had a labor dispute with petitioner. Asked him to cooperate by not dealing with petitioner and by taking petitioner\u2019s merchandise \u2022off his shelves. Told him that if he failed to cooperate they would pass out handbills to customers. Handbills were passed out but the manager continued his purchases from petitioner. The handbills passed out at this market, as well as at other markets herein mentioned, read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-6\">\u201cTo THE PATRONS OF THIS STORE\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-7\">\u25a0\u201cWHOLESALE DELIVERY DRIVERS &amp; SALESMEN\u2019S LOCAL NO. 848 urgently requests that you do not buy the following products distributed by SERVETTE, INC.:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-8\">\u201c* BRACH\u2019S CANDY</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-9\">* SERVETTE CANDY</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-10\">* GOOD SEASON SALAD DRESSING</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-11\">* OLD LONDON PRODUCTS</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-12\">\u201cThe SERVETTE COMPANY which distributes these products refuses to negotiate with the Union that represents its drivers. The Company is attempting to force the drivers to sign individual \u2018Yellow Dog\u2019 contracts. These contracts will destroy the wages and working conditions that the drivers now enjoy, and will set them back 20 years in their struggle for decent wages and working conditions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-13\">\u201cThe drivers of Servette appreciate your cooperation in this fight.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b709-14\">2. Asked the manager of McDaniels Market No. 18 to remove merchandise \u2022distributed by petitioner from his shelves. At a meeting of the store managers of McDaniels, the managers were told by higher officials to use their best judgment in the matter and to do as they thought wise. The manager of Mc-Daniels Market No. 18 either reduced his purchases from or ceased doing business with petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-17\">3. Requested the manager of Mc-Daniels Market No. 25 not to handle petitioner\u2019s merchandise. He was shown a copy of the handbill. The manager of McDaniels Market No. 25 either diminished or terminated his business with petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-18\">4. Requested the manager of Daylight Market No. 3 to cooperate with them in their dispute with petitioner by not handling petitioner\u2019s products, and told him they were passing out handbills to the customers of those markets which refused to cooperate.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-19\">5. Told the manager of Kory\u2019s Market No. 6 of the dispute with petitioner, showed a copy of the handbill to him, and told him that the handbills would be passed out to his customers unless Kory ceased doing business with petitioner. When the manager told them he would have to check with the main office, handbills were passed out to customers. The next week the manager refused to allow petitioner to stock his shelves. On two subsequent occasions, agents visited this market to ascertain whether or not petitioner\u2019s merchandise was on display.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-20\">6. Passed out handbills at Kory\u2019s Market No. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-21\">7. Asked the manager of Kory\u2019s Market No. 1 if he would cooperate by removing petitioner\u2019s products from his shelves. The manager said he would have to ask advice from his supervisor. Handbilling occurred at this market on two different occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-22\">8. Passed out handbills to the customers of Kory\u2019s Market No. 2 and told the manager that they would stop hand-billing if he would cease handling petitioner\u2019s products.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-23\">9. Passed out handbills to customers of Kory\u2019s Market No. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>Handbilling occurred at certain of the markets above mentioned which purchased GOOD SEASON SALAD DRESSING and OLD LONDON PRODUCTS not from petitioner but from Certified Grocers of Southern California, another distributor not involved in the labor dispute existing between petitioner and the Union.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">The Board, with one member dissenting, concluded that the conduct and practices of the Union did not constitute a violation of \u00a7 8(b) (4) (i) (B) and that the handbilling of the various markets doing business with the petitioner was protected by the publicity proviso to \u00a7 8(b)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">In its decision and order, the Board stated, in part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-6\">\u201cWe agree with the Trial Examiner\u2019s conclusion that the appeal to the various store managers doing business with Servette did not constitute a violation of Section 8(b) (4) (i) (B), since the record establishes that the store managers whom the respondent sought to persuade not to do business with Servette were not \u2018individuals\u2019 as that term is used in Section 8(b)(4)(i)(B). We do so, however, only for the reasons set forth in the Carolina Lumber Company<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and Minneapolis House Furnishing Company<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> cases. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-9\">\u201cWe also agree, on the basis of our recent Lohman Sales Company decision,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> that the Respondent\u2019s handbilling of the various stores doing business with Servette was protected by the publicity proviso to Section 8(b) (4).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b710-10\">The dissenting member stated, in part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-11\">\u201cAs I pointed out in my dissenting opinion in Lohman Sales, 132 NLRB No. 67, the proviso to Section 8(b)' (4) does not protect handbilling of secondary employers in furtherance of a dispute with a distributor; the proviso contemplates, at most, the protection of handbilling of a secondary distributor in furtherance of a dispute with a primary employer who produces a product. And the-bare and simple fact is that Servette does not produce any products.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-16\">\u201cAccordingly, I would find the Respondent\u2019s threats to handbill, and its subsequent handbilling activities,, constitute violations of Section 8(b)' (4)(ii)(B) of. the Act.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b710-17\">The position of the Board, as stated in its reply brief, appears in the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-18\">\u201cIn the Board\u2019s view, the Union\u2019s appeals to the various retail store managers did not constitute a violation of Section 8(b) (4) (i) (B) because, although the forbidden object existed, the means for attaining that object which the Section proscribes was lacking. That is, the only persons induced were the store managers who cannot be regarded as \u2018any individual employed by any person\u201d within the meaning of Section 8(b)-(4)(i)(B). Rather, the store managers must be considered as \u2018any person\u2019 under Section 8(b) (4) (ii)\u201e and, as such, entitled to protection, against the type of conduct or means, specifically proscribed therein, namely, threats, coercion, or restraint.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b710-19\">Admittedly, each of the store managers-, is an individual and each is employed by a person engaged in commerce. It is the-petitioner\u2019s contention that the clear-wording of the phrase \u201cany individual employed by any person\u201d leaves no room, for any construction that would exclude-\u201csupervisors\u201d from the category de~ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>\u25a0scribed in the phrase. Petitioner also asserts that Congressional history fortifies petitioner\u2019s contention that Congressional intent in the choice of the language employed in the phrase was to make it .an unfair labor practice for a union to induce or encourage \u201csupervisors\u201d where-an object is to force or require any employer \u201cto cease doing business with any \u2022other person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">The issue thus created arises under \"the amendments made to \u00a7 8(b)(4)(A) (P.L. 86-257, 73 Stat. 519, approved Sept. 14, 1959). For the amended law, see Footnote 1, supra.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-6\">Section 8(b)(4)(A) provided:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-7\">\u201cIt shall be an unfair labor practice for a labor organization or its \u25a0agents\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-8\">\u201c(4) to engage in, or to induce or encourage the <em>employees of any employer </em>to engage in, a strike or a concerted refusal in the course of their employment to use, manufacture, process, transport, or otherwise handle or work on any goods, articles, materials, or commodities or to perform any services, where an -object thereof is:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-9\">\u201c(A) forcing or requiring any \u2022employer or self-employed person to .join any labor or employer organi-sation or any employer or other per.son to cease using, selling, handling, transporting, or otherwise dealing in the products of any other producer, processor, or manufacturer, or to cease doing business with any other person.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-10\">(Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b711-13\">In its Carolina Lumber Company case, supra, upon which the Board rested its decision in the instant case, the above Section was held by the Board not to be applicable to inducement of supervisors <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> because they were not employees within the meaning of the Act,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and, further, that Section was held not to apply to the inducement of farm, railway, or public employees for the same reason.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> It is to be noted (see Footnote 1, supra) that \u00a7 8(b) (4) (i) (B) substitutes the phrase \u201cany individual employed by any person\u201d for the phrase \u201cemployees of any employer\u201d as used in \u00a7 8(b)(4)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-14\">The Board recognized in its decision in the Carolina Lumber Company case, supra, \u201c[t]hat the new law bars inducement of a broader category of employed persons tha[n] the old * * *\u201d but concluded from legislative history that \u201c \u2018any individual employed by any person\u2019 in 8(b) (4) (i) refers to supervisors who in interest are more nearly related to \u2018rank-and-file employees\u2019 than to \u2018management,\u2019 as the term is generally understood. On the other hand, the term \u2018person\u2019 as used in 8(b) (4) (ii) would seem to refer to individuals more nearly related to the management level. So construed, 8(b) (4) (i) would outlaw attempts to induce or encourage employees and some supervisors, to achieve the objectives proscribed by 8(b)(4). Similar attempts to induce or encourage others more nearly related to the managerial level for the same objectives would be lawful. However, if in the latter case the labor organization went beyond persuasion and attempted to coerce such managerial officials to accomplish the pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>scribed objectives, it would violate 8(b) (4) (ii).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">While the Board concedes that the substituted phrase \u201cany individual employed by any person\u201d for the phrase \u201cemployees of any employer,\u201d shows on its face a Congressional intent to broaden the category of employed persons and that the literal meaning of the language employed by Congress is broad enough to include \u201csupervisors\u201d in the category described in the Section as \u201cany individual employed by any person,\u201d it urges, nevertheless, that to give the phrase the construction urged upon us by the petitioner would be contrary to the purpose of the Act, contrary to Congressional intent, and would render \u00a7 8(b) (4) (ii) (B) of the Act meaningless and futile.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">Before giving further consideration to the problem before us, we note that the definition of \u201csupervisor\u201d in the Act (see Footnote 5, supra) is broad. It means</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-6\">\u201c* * * any individual having authority, in the interest of the employer, to hire, transfer, suspend, lay off, recall, promote, discharge, assign, reward, or discipline other employees, or responsibly to direct them, or to adjust their grievances, or effectively to recommend such action, if in connection with the foregoing the exercise of such authority is not of a merely routine or clerical nature, but requires the use of independent judgment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b712-8\">It has long been settled by court decisions that an employee must be classified as a supervisor if he exercises any one of the powers set forth in \u00a7 2(11) of the Act. National Labor Relations Bd. v. Edward G. Budd Mfg. Co., 169 F.2d 571 (6th Cir. 1948), cert. denied 335 U.S. 908, 69 S.Ct. 411, 93 L.Ed. 441; Ohio Power Co. v.

Southern Airways Company, 290 F.2d 519 (5th Cir. 1961). Supervisory status is determined by the powers and duties of an employee, and not by his title. National Lab. Rel. Bd. v. Southern Bleachery &amp; Pr.

Southern Airways Company, supra, 290 F.2d at p. 523:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-11\">\u201cThe legislative history of \u00a7 2(11) is helpful in this regard. The Senate Report envisaged a \u2018supervisor\u2019 under the Act as being an employee \u2018vested with such general management prerogatives as the right to hire or fire, discipline, or make effective recommendations with respect to such action. * * *\u2019 Sen. Rep. 105, 80th Cong.; 1 Leg.His. of the L.M.R.A. p. 410; Poultry Enterprises, Inc. v. N.L.R.B., 5 Cir., 1954, 216 F.2d 798, 801. As expressed on the floor of the Senate, to come within this category the individual should \u2018direct responsibly\u2019 the action of employees under him. 2 Leg.His. of the L.M.R.A., p. 1303; N.L.R.B. v. Swift &amp; Co., 9 Cir., 1957, 240 F. 2d 65, 66 note 1. The Conference Report on the Bill later enacted into \u00a7 2(11) shows that the definition was intended to cover persons \u2018generally regarded as foremen and persons of like or higher rank.\u2019 1947 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News, pp. 1135, 1141.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b712-13\">It is clear to us that under the old Section insofar as relevant to the problem before us, \u201cemployees of an employer\u201d embraced all employees except supervisors as defined in the Act and that there existed but one category of employees who were excluded from the term \u201cemployees\u201d and that category was by law defined as \u201csupervisors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b712-14\">It must be assumed that members of Congress were aware of the definitions contained in the Act and the unanimity of court decisions construing the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-15\">Since a supervisor is an individual employed by an employer and since by the provisions of the Act (see Foot<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>note 6, supra) the term \u201cemployee\u201d does not include any individual employed as a supervisor, it appears clear that when Congress amended the phrase \u201cthe employees of any employer\u201d to read \u201cany individual employed by any person,\u201d Congress intended by the plain, unambiguous language used to include supervisors in the category described in the amendment as \u201cany individual employed by any person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">Under the view that the plain meaning of the language used by Congress was at variance with the purpose of the Act and the intent of Congress, the Board resorted to legislative history and concluded that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-6\">\u201c \u2018any individual employed by any person\u2019 in 8(b) (4) (i) refers to <em>supervisors who in interest are more nearly related to \u2018rank-and-file employees\u2019 than to \u2018management,\u2019 </em>as the term is generally understood. On the other hand, the term \u2018person\u2019 as used in 8(b)(4) (ii) would seem <em>to refer to individuals more nearly related to the management level. </em>So construed 8(b) (4) (i) would outlaw attempts to induce or encourage <em>employees and some supervisors, </em>to \u2022achieve the objectives proscribed by \u20228(b)(4). Similar attempts to induce or encourage <em>others more nearly related to the managerial level </em>for the same objectives would be lawful * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-7\">(Emphasis ours.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b713-8\">By such construction, the Board creates two categories of \u201csupervisors\u201d contrary to the definition of the term \u201csupervisor\u201d as used in the Act and contrary to court decisions. In one category are supervisors related to rank-and-file employees, and in the other category are supervisors more related to management. The Board\u2019s construction also requires that the phrase \u201cany person engaged in commerce,\u201d appearing in \u00a7 8(b) (4) (i), shall be given a different meaning than the same phrase appearing in \u00a7 8(b)(4) (ii). The Board\u2019s construction would place labor organizations in an untenable and precarious position. Such construction in many instances would force labor organizations to run the risk of committing unfair labor practices without knowing which \u201csupervisors\u201d of an employer they could or could not lawfully induce or encourage and which \u201csupervisors\u201d are or are not persons engaged in commerce under \u00a7 8(b)(4) (ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-11\">The Board also contends that if the plain meaning of the language used in the new law be followed, \u00a7 8(b) (4) (ii) would be rendered meaningless and futile because the word \u201cinduce\u201d appearing in \u00a7 8(b) (4) (i) has the same meaning as the word \u201cthreaten\u201d appearing in \u00a7 8(b)(4) (ii). Our research leads us to the conclusion that the two words have separate and distinct meanings.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-12\">The Board contends that the plain meaning of \u00a7 8(b) (4) (i) is at variance with the purpose of the National Labor Relations Act and contrary to the intent of Congress,</p>\n<p id=\"b713-13\">The Supreme Court, in United States v. Amer. Trucking Ass\u2019ns, 310 U.S. 534, at pp. 543-544, 60 S.Ct. 1059, at pp. 1063, 1064, 84 L.Ed. 1345, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-14\">\u201cThere is, of course, no more persuasive evidence of the purpose of a statute than the words by which the legislature undertook to give expression to its wishes. Often these words are sufficient in and of themselves to detennine the purpose of the legislation. In such cases we have followed their plain meaning. When that meaning has led to absurd or futile results, however, this Court has looked beyond the words to the purpose of the act. Frequently, however, even when the plain meaning did not produce absurd results but merely an unreasonable one \u2018plainly at variance with the policy of the legislation as a whole\u2019 this Court has followed that purpose, rather than the literal words. When aid to construction of the meaning of words, as used in the statute, is available, there certainly can be no \u2018rule of law\u2019 which forbids its use, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>however clear the words may appear on \u2018superficial examination.\u2019 \u201d (Footnotes omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">If under the above quoted decision, resort may properly be made to legislative history, we find therein no basis for the Board\u2019s contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">The basic purpose of the National Labor Relations Act is to promote industrial peace through collective bargaining and an orderly settlement of disputes.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">The evil which Congress sought to correct, as stated by Representative Griffin, is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-7\">\u201cPresent law provides that it is unlawful for a union to induce or encourage \u2018employees of any employer\u2019 to engage in a strike or \u2018concerted refusal\u2019 to do their work for one of the forbidden objects listed in Section 8(b)(4) \u2014 such as to force their Employer to cease doing business with a \u2018primary employer.\u2019 Since farm laborers, railway labor and supervisors are not \u2018employees\u2019 within the meaning of the Act, unions may now, without penalty, induce them to engage in secondary boycotts. This bill corrects this by changing the word \u2018employees\u2019 in the phrase quoted above to \u2018any individual employed by any person.\u2019 This change appears in clause 4(i).\u201d (Legislative History of the Labor Management and Disclosure Act of 1959, Vol. II, pp. 1520-1523 (G.P.O. 1959)).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b714-8\">In explaining this change, then Senator Kennedy and Representative Thompson, his conference associate, submitted an analysis of the differences between the House and Senate bills before the Conference Committee (105 Cong.Rec. 16589; II Leg.Hist. 1706-1707) with the following comment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-9\">\u201cIn some industries supervisors belong to the union of the rank-and-file workers or as ex-members are sympathetic to it. Occasionally a union has induced the supervisors of a secondary employer to refuse to handle the goods of some primary employer with whom the union had a dispute. This conduct causes a true secondary boycott but it does' not violate section 8(b)(4)(A) because section 8(b)(4)(A) forbids only the inducement of \u2018employees\u20191 and supervisors are not \u2018employees\u2019 within the statutory definition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-11\">**#*#*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-12\">\u201cThe House bill would extend the prohibition to inducement of supervisors. The present omission is an illogical loophole which should be closed if any legislation dealing with secondary boycotts is enacted. The substance of the House bill is therefore acceptable upon this issue.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b714-13\">Senator Morse, one of the conferees on the part of the Senate, who spoke in favor of the conference bill\u2019s provision, stated (105 Cong.Rec. 17882; II Leg.Hist. 1426):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-14\">\u201cThere are many instances aIso&gt; where a secondary boycott is conducted by a union agent going to a supervisor of employees, who often is a union member, and inducing him-to shut off deliveries. Since the supervisor is subject to union discipline, such inducement would be-clearly as effective as though inducement were applied to employees,, themselves.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b714-15\">Senator Humphrey stated, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-16\">\u201c[T]he amendment proposed by the Senator from Arizona [Mr. Goldwater] would change the words \u2018employees of any employer\u2019 to \u2018any individual employed by any person\u2019, and would delete the word \u2018concerted\u2019 * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-17\">\u201cAs it now stands, section 8(b) (4) does not prohibit appeals or requests directed to supervisory or managerial employees because these individuals are not employees within the statutory definition. But they are surely individuals; and to substitute the word \u2018individual\u2019 for the word \u2018employees\u2019 would place requests and appeals to them within the prohibition of the law.\u201d Re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>marks of Senator Humphrey on the Goldwater amendment, 105 Daily Cong.Rec. 5580, April 17, 1959, II Leg.Hist. 1037.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">In the Senate Committee analysis of \u2018this change, it is stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-6\">\u201cThe present law bans the inducement of employees of a scondary employer when the object thereof is to cease doing business with another employer. The revision includes the following features * * *. (2) Inducement of a single employee or a supervisor employed by a secondary employer is banned. * * Senate Committee Analysis, Committee print, Subcommittee on Labor of the Committee on Labor and Public Welfare, United States Senate, 86th Congress, First Session, Sept. 10, 1959, I Leg.Hist. 965.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b715-8\">We do not agree that the plain wording of the new amendment is at variance with the purpose of the Act or the intent of Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-9\">Our attention has been called to the fact that the Second Circuit in N.L.R.B. v. Local 294, Internat\u2019l Bro. of Teamsters etc., 298 F.2d 105 (2d Cir. 1961), has reached a different result from that reached in this opinion. We have reviewed such opinion but are not persuaded. Rather, we are persuaded by the following quotation from Crooks v. Harrelson, 282 U.S. 55 (1930), at p. 60, 51 S.Ct. 49, at p. 50 where the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-10\">\u201cCourts have sometimes exercised a high degree of ingenuity in the effort to find justification for wrenching from the words of a statute a meaning which literally they did not bear in order to escape consequences thought to be absurd or to entail great hardship. But an application of the principle so nearly approaches the boundary between the exercise of the judicial power and that of the legislative power as to call rather for great caution and circumspection in order to avoid usurpation of the latter. Monson v. Chester, 22 Pick. [Mass.] 385, 387. It is not enough merely that hard and objectionable or absurd consequences, which probably were not within the contemplation of the framers, are produced by an act of legislation. Laws enacted with good intention, when put to the test, frequently, and to the surprise of the law maker himself, turn out to be mischievous, absurd or otherwise objectionable. But in such case the remedy lies with law making authority, and not with the courts. See In re Alma Spinning Company, L. R. 16 Ch.Div. 681, 686; King v. Commissioners, 5 A. &amp; E. 804, 816; Ab-ley v. Dale, L.J. (1851) N.S. Pt. 2, Vol. 20, 233, 235. And see generally Chung Fook v. White, 264 U.S. 443, 445 [44 S.Ct. 361, 68 L.Ed. 781]; Commr. of Immigration v. Gottlieb, 265 U.S. 310, 313 [44 S.Ct. 528, 68 L.Ed. 1031].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b715-13\">We disagree with the Board\u2019s conclusion that the handbilling of the various markets doing business with the petitioner was protected by the publicity proviso to \u00a7 8(b) (4). The proviso does not protect threats to handbill and hand-billing of secondary employers in furtherance of a dispute with a distributor. Petitioner is a distributor and does not produce any products. The effect of the proviso in the case of a distributor is fully discussed in the opinion of this Court in Great Western Broadcasting Corporation v. N. L. R. B., 310 F.2d 591. We deem it unnecessary to repeat here what is stated in that opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-14\">The Board erred in dismissing the unfair labor practice complaint. The Board\u2019s decision, findings and order are and each of them is set aside. The cause is remanded to the Board for further proceedings consistent with the views expressed herein.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b708-10\">.
