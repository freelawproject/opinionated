This contention is based on the fact that the indictment, following the language of the statute, set forth that Bentley and another \u201cdid knowingly transport in interstate commerce\u201d Dorothy Maxine Stancil and Sandra Goslin, \u201cwho had been unlawfully seized, kidnapped, confined, and carried away, and held for ransom or reward, or otherwise, and the said\u201d Dorothy Maxine Stancil and Sandra Goslin \u201chad not been liberated unharmed, but had been beaten, bruised and injured, in violation of Section 1201, Title 18, United States Code.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b733-19\">Appellant challenges his conviction upon an indictment that charged him with holding the victims for \u201cransom or reward, <em>or otherwise,\u201d </em>when the evidence related solely to a purpose other than ransom or reward; and he contends that the indictment must state the motive or reason of the accused for committing the act of kidnapping if the government intends to prove its case under the term, \u201cotherwise.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b733-20\">The background of the Federal Kidnapping Statute, and its amendatory provisions containing the term, \u201cotherwise,\u201d together with relevant legislative history, is found in Gooch v. United States, 297 U.S. 124, 56 S.Ct. 395, 80 L.Ed. 522.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-21\">There is a division of authority as to whether an indictment for kidnapping need contain any details of purpose or motive.</p>\n<p id=\"AYc\">We are of the opinion that such an indictment need not contain any details of purpose or motive, and that it is sufficient if it charges such purpose or motive to be for \u201cransom, or reward, or otherwise.\u201d In support of this view, see Hayes v. United States, 296 F.2d 657 (C.A.8); Dawson v. United States, 292 F.2d 365 (C.A.9); Clinton v. United States, 260 F.2d 824 (C.A.5) cert. den. 359 U.S. 948, 79 S.Ct. 731, 3 L.Ed.2d 681; Knight v. United States, 137 F.2d 940 (C.A.8). See contra, United States v. Varner, 283 F.2d 900 (C.A.7).</p>\n<p id=\"b733-24\">If appellant had desired information as to the specific motive or purpose claimed in the kidnapping indictment, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>could have secured it by asking for a Bill of Particulars, as did his co-defendant in requesting the government to set forth the meaning of \u201cotherwise,\u201d as authorized by Rule 7(f) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\">In accordance with the foregoing, the judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
