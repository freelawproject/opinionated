In this case, the papers disclose that the appellant did not have the notice required by the rules; the affirmance was for default of his appearance; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>it is nowhere shewn that he had actual notice. Besides, his affidavit is additional weight to satisfy us that he had not.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-4\">The judgment of affirmance must he set aside; and the cause restored to the calendar.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
