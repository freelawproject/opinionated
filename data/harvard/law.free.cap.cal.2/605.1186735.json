M. Smith, one of the defendants, and made payable ninety days after date to the plaintiffs; which note was indorsed by the other defendant Parke; the complaint avers that Parke indorsed the same before it was delivered to the plaintiff ; and that when it became due, it was duly presented to the maker and payment demanded, which was refused; of which demand and refusal due notice was given to Parke, the said, indorser.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b597-8\">The defendants were duly summoned, who made default; and judgment was entered thereupon; from which Parke, one of the defendants, the (indorser) appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b597-9\"><em>Meld, </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b597-10\">A default only admits the truth of the facts alleged. No other effect follows; and if the facts do not show a right to recover, the judgment cannot stand. Parke\u2019s liability in the case is that of indorser after the payee (the plaintiff); the latter must be the first indorser, and Parke the second. The payee whose liability comes immediately after that of the maker, cannot sustain an action against a subsequent party, unless such party is a guarantor, which is not the case here. This is in fact an attempt of an indorser to sue his indorsee. It makes no difference that Parke indorsed the note before its delivery; for it is to be presumed he knew that his liability was subsequent to that of the payee. Parke can be considered only an indorser, and not as a guarantor; for the note is negotiable, and as indorser, his liability is second to that of the payee. Sto. on Prom.

The default, upon proper averments, dispenses with this proof; and the judgment is consequently affirmed with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
