The summons was served on all the defendants,in San Francisco, on the 4th of June, 1851. At a special term of the District Court, held the 17th of February, 1852, after reciting that service had been duly made on the defendants, and no answer had been filed by them, and that it appeared from the evidence on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>the part of the people, that the defendants were indebted to the.

Act, sec. 25, (Quaere ?) 2d. The summons does not state that judgment by default would be taken unless the defendants appeared and answered; nor specify any amount for which judgment would be taken. Pract. Act, sec. 24; 150. 3d. The Court rendered judgment without ordering the damages assessed. 4th. The defendants were summoned to appear at Double Springs, which was not the county seat.</p>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b234-6\">The <em>Attorney Gteneral </em>declined arguing the case.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b234-7\">Chief Justice Murray</author>\n<p id=\"A9j\">delivered the opinion of the Court. The summons in this case is radically defective, and insufficient to support a judgment by default; so much so that the Attorney General expresses his unwillingness to urge the affirmance of the judgment. Under these circumstances, it is unnecessary to look further into the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">Judgment reversed, &amp;c.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
