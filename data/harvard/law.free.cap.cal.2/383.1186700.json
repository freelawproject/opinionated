Penfield, Charles Yan Pelt and Silas H. Bennett, and the certificates thereto appended; to the reading of which defendants objected on the ground that the notice was insufficient; that the depositions of Anthony Penfield and Yan Pelt were taken on a day different from that in the notice to defendant; and for the insufficiency of the certificates of the officers, before whom they were taken. The Court overruled the objection, and permitted the depositions to be read, and defendants excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b375-10\">The notice was addressed to Messrs. Robertson and Howell, attorneys of defendants, to the effect that the depositions of Pen-field, Yan Pelt and Anthony Ludlam would be taken before Justice Shephard, of San Francisco, on the 12th day of August, to be read, &amp;c.; and that the depositions of Anthony Bennett and Joseph H.

Hecox, Notary Public in and for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>the County of Santa Cruz, shows that the deposition of Bennett was taken before him on the 16th August, at the town of Santa Cruz, which certificate is sealed with the Notary\u2019s private seal, for want of an official one. The cause was taken by appeal to the Supreme Court, by whose decision, without any reference to the merits, the cause was remanded, the Court sustaining the exceptions taken to the reading of the depositions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b376-4\">No brief filed for respondent.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b376-5\"><em>T. Rolinson, </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b376-6\">The Court erred in admitting depositions taken at San Francisco, when defendants were notified that they would be taken at Santa Cruz, and also in admitting depositions taken on a day different from that stated in the notice to defendant. Laws of California, 1851, p. 118, sec. 4294 Porter, 446, 960, 162; 6 Alabama, 681; 4 Alabama, 649. The certificates to the same were not good.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b376-7\">Murray, Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"AhG\">On the trial of this cause, the plaintiff read in evidence certain depositions, which were objected to by the defendant, on the ground that the certificate of the officer before whom they were taken, was not in conformity with the statute, and that the depositions did not show that they were taken upon the day.of notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">We have before decided that this mode of taking testimony to be used in civil causes, is in derogation of the common law, and that the officer must follow the statute strictly. Every requisition of the statute ifiust appear upon the deposition, to entitle it to admission. In this case the certificate of the officer is defective, and the depositions should have been excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-9\">It is contended by the respondent, however, that the objections were not taken in time; that the exceptions should have been filed before the time of trial.'</p>\n<p id=\"b376-10\">There is nothing in the statute, which renders this necessary, and in the absence of statutory provision or an exp ress rule of Court upon the subject, the objection can be made at any time before the depositions are read in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-11\">We have carefully examined the facts of this case, with the view of sustaining the judgment of the Court below, without the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>assistance of this evidence, but are unable to do so without usurping the province of a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
