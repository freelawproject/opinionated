This mortgage to Ford and Goodwin, contains a power, authorising them, upon default in payment of the note at its maturity, or of its interest, to sell the mortgaged premises, \u201c either at private sale or public auction, after ten days previous notice of such intended sale, and to execute conveyances.\u201d \u201cAnd out of the money arising from such sale, to retain the amount of said note, and the interest which shall then be due thereon, together with the costs and charges of the sale of said premises, and to render the overplus of the proceeds of such sale, if any there be, unto the said party of the first part.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b380-5\">A like power is contained in each of the preceding mortgages.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b380-6\">That afterwards, on the 26th December, Field conveyed all his estate to Charles Ellet and D. C. Benham, in trust for the benefit of his creditors; which included his equity of redemption in the above mortgages. That on the 20th of September, 1851, the said Charles Ellet, one of the above trustees, with the approval of Benham and Field, conveyed to Franklin W. Shaeffer the trust estate contained in the foregoing deed, to hold the same in connexion with De Witt C. Benham, as joint trustee, and upon the same trusts, &amp;e. That sometime in February, 1851, the defendants, Goodwin and Ford, took possession of the property mortgaged to them, and agreed to divide the property covered by both of these mortgages, and keep it, and to execute conveyances to each other. And that by such agreement the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>said Goodwin and Ford were to keep and have from Rowe, a conveyance of a part of the property mortgaged to him, and the said Rowe was to keep the balance, and receive a conveyance thereof from Ford and Goodwin; and to make up for any irregularity in the division, the said Goodwin and Ford were to convey a portion of the property mortgaged to them, to the said Rowe, and also to pay Rowe, on account of said mortgage, $700; which it was agreed should be applied to the said mortgage of Cunningham and Brumagim; and also to give said Rowe a building, situated on a lot (2) which was covered by both of their mortgages.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b381-4\">That Rowe, on or about February 15, 1851, in pursuance of his agreement with Goodwin and Ford, took possession of, and removed from lot (2) the building thereon, and converted the same to his own use, worth $600; and received from Ford and Goodwin lots Nos. 1 and 2 of block six, and lots Nos. 6 and 7 of block three, which were worth $400 each, and the sum of $700, applied as above to the mortgage of Cunningham and Brumagim.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b381-5\">That Goodwin and Ford paid to Cunningham and Brumagim $1300, half the amount due on their mortgage, in addition to the said $700 paid for defendant Rowe; leaving a balance of $600 due on their said mortgage, which was paid with interest by Rowe; on the 10th July last. That on the 28th April, 1851, Goodwin and Ford executed in the name of Field, the plaintiff, pretending to act as his attorney in fact, under the power contained in their mortgage, a conveyance to Rowe of all the property described in their said mortgage, setting forth a money consideration of $3983. And that Rowe, on the 21st July last, conveyed back to the defendants Goodwin and Ford, a portion of the property contained in the said conveyance to him, as described in the said complaint, reciting a money consideration of $3000; which several conveyances, the said complaint charges, were made for the purpose of carrying into execution the agreement between the several parties thereto, as above set forth. The complaint further charges that no money consideration was paid on the alleged sales by either party to the other; but that the said conveyances were made by the defendants, for the purpose of more easily dividing the mortgaged property among themselves, and forfeiting the rights of the plaintiff thereto. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>And charges that no sufficient notice was given to Field of the intention of Goodwin and Ford to sell under the power in their mortgage, nor to Ellet or Benham, the trustees; but admits that the notice marked E. was given to Ellet and Benham, the sufficiency of which is denied; and plaintiff insists that the power only authorized a sale <em>for cash; </em>that no: such sale had been made; that the conveyances above stated conferred no new rights on the parties, or other title than they respectively held before the conveyances were executed among themselves. And charges that Rowe sold a lot to House about the month of April last, which is included in <em>Ms </em>mortgage, and not in the others, for \u00a71000, and, about the 12th June thereafter (1851), caused the same lot to be sold at public auction under the power contained in his mortgage, when the same was bid in by House'for $200; and insists that Rowe should be charged with the $1000, which should be credited on Rowe\u2019s mortgage, or with the fair value of the lot, which is worth more than $200, and is worth $800. And charges that since defendants took possession of the\" property about the 1st day of February last, they have remained in possession of their respective portions as agreed among themselves, and have leased the same, and received the rents; and that Rowe has received large sums as rent; plaintiffs knew not how much; and Rowe has refused to account, &amp;c., except upon the condition that he retain possession of the naortgag\u00e9d premises now held by him, and receive a quit claim deed for the same from the said assignees of Field; on the receipt of which he is willing to relinquish the notes of Field mentioned in the mortgages; and plaintiff avers that the property in Rowe\u2019s hands is worth $250 per month; and asks that he be charged therewith unless he produce his accounts, and show the true amount received by him. That Cunningham and Brumagim, their mortgage being paid by Goodwin, Ford and Rowe, assigned the same and their estate therein, one half to Rowe, and the other half to Goodwin and Ford,\" and passed the note of Field with the said assignment to the same parties.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b382-4\">That on the 26th September (the present month), the plaintiffs executed to Goodwin and Ford a conveyance of certain property described; who, on the 29th September, executed to Field a- general release of all mortgages, notes and demands whatsoever, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>and including the half of the mortgage assigned to them by Cunningham and Brumagim, against whom therefore no personal claim is made, they being made parties, because of the execution of their conveyance to Rowe, assuming to act as attorney in fact for Field.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b383-4\">The bill then asks to charge the defendant Rowe with the sums alleged to have been received by him with all rents, &amp;c., and to give him certain credits, &amp;c.; and avers that he was indebted to plaintiffs $1335, on the 26th September, 1851. And prays for an account, &amp;c., and for delivery up to plaintiffs of certain premises held by defendants, covered by his mortgage, and not conveyed by the deed of 26th September, instant, to Goodwin and Ford. That the conveyance of 29th April, 1851, be declared void so far as it covers certain lots ; and that defendants acknowledge satisfaction on the respective mortgages, and of the mortgage assigned by Cunningham and Brumagim, cancel the notes, &amp;c., and for an injunction to restrain Rowe from collecting rents, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b383-5\">The answer of Rowe admits the several mortgages and notes as laid in the complaint, the deed of assignment, &amp;e.; denies payment further than is confessed in the answer, and avers that Field frequently requested him to sell some of the mortgaged property to pay himself, or that Rowe, Ford, and Goodwin, should pay Cunningham and Brumagim\u2019s mortgage and notes, and take the land, and thus relieve Field\u2019s of this liability, &amp;e. That he sought a purchaser for the property without success. That in January, 1851, being able to do no better, and the trustees of Field paying nothing\u2014the said Ford and Goodwin gave the notice of sale stated in the complaint, which was directed to both trustees, but served on Ellet only, Bonham being absent. The sale was postponed for sometime; and in the month of February, 1851, Ellet informed Rowe that he had received information from Field on the subject, and he (Ellet) then and there made a formal delivery of the said mortgaged premises to the said Rowe, and the said Goodwin acting for the said Ford and himself. And it was agreed between Ellet and Rowe, and Field and Goodwin, that they should assume and pay the said Cunningham and Brumagim the note of Field to them, and for that, and the amounts due on those notes, they should have the mortgaged property; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>Ellet agreed that when Benham came home they would convey the same to the defendants; and that under this arrangement, Rowe, Ford and Goodwin,'took and held possession of the property. Rowe admits that in January, 1851, he took possession of some unoccupied property\u2014part of the mortgaged premises,\u2014 and gave Ellet notice of the fact, who resisted it, and Rowe abandoned it. After this arrangement with Ellet, Rowe, Goodwin and Ford took possession of the property, and divided the same, as they now hold it. Rowe agreeing to give Goodwin and Ford half of a small house for the choice, which he valued at $200. That a few days before the 10th March, 1851, Benham and Ellet, and Rowe, Goodwin and Ford, met, to determine in what manner the conveyance should be made for said property; and the said Goodwin and Rowe insisted, that if they gave up all their notes against Field, including the one to Cunningham and Brumagim, that they ought to receive a warranty deed for the said premises. This the other parties dissented to. And to settle the matter, it was agreed that a quit claim deed should be made by Ellet and Benham, to Rowe and Goodwin, for the said real estate; and that Rowe, and Field, and Goodwin, should hold the notes and mortgages as security for the title till Field should make a warranty deed to them, &amp;c; Rowe was to prepare the papers, and did so; and on the 10th March, 1851, the same were tendered to Ellet and Benham for their approval and execution; that the said Ellet and Benham had changed their minds, and would not accept or approve the said papers, which- compelled said Rowe, Goodwin, and Ford, to resort to the power of attorney, authorizing them to sell, contained in their several mortgages. That on the 16th April, 1851, they gave a notice to Benham of their intention to sell, &amp;c., as they had before given notice to Ellet.. That on the 28th April, 1851, the said Goodwin acting as attorney for Field, under the power, &amp;c., conveyed to Rowe, subject to the mortgages of Cunningham and Brumagim, and the said Rowe, the further consideration of the said conveyance being the amount due the said Ford and Goodwin on their note and mortgage, which was taken to be $3,983. That on the 1st July, Rowe quit claimed the lands described in exhibit D of plaintiff\u2019s complaint to Ford and Goodwin, and other property, (as described,) and that the object of the said conveyances to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>each other was to perfect the titles thereof in themselves, and accomplish what Ellet and Benham ought to have done.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b385-3\">That Rowe on 30th May, 1851, caused to be posted up the following notice on the City Hall, &amp;c., and published it three times in the Marysville Herald. <em>uPublic Sale. </em>Stephen J.

House, that being the best \u00a1Drice that could be obtained for it. That House paid for said lot $1000 of Tuba county warrants, worth at the time of sale about forty cents in the dollar, equal to $400 in cash; and Rowe made a deed to House as attorney of Field, under the power in his mortgage. That Goodwin and Ford after the agreement with Ellet, that they should have the mortgaged property, &amp;c., for the amount due on the three mortgages, in compliance with tho said agreement, paid to Cunningham and Brumagim on the 26th February, 1851, \u00a72000 on their note, &amp;c., which, when all paid, \u25a0was to be indorsed to Goodwin for the indemnity of himself, Ford and Rowe against Field; that \u00a71,300 of this sum was paid for Goodwin and Ford, and \u00a7700 was paid by them for Rowe\u2014 leaving \u00a7600 to be paid by Rowe, who some days after sold to Ford and Goodwin his interest (one-half) in the large frame house, for \u00a7700, which paid them the said $700 paid for Rowe to Cunningham and Brumagim.

House proposed to pay in county warrants; and it seems that Rowe would not receive them at a greater value than forty cents to the dollar. On the day of sale, a third person attends, and as the agent of House bids the sum of $200. Instead of this sum being paid according to the terms of sale, there seems to have been no attention paid to the bid, and Rowe, the mortgagee, in possession, making the sale, went on to perfect the contract, that he had previously and privately made with Judge House, and deeded to him the lot. There does not appear to be the least privity between the sale as made on the day advertised, (the 12th June, 1851,) and the deed to Judge House.

As to the <em>first, </em>the condition pre-, cedent to the exercise of the power, was never complied with. <em>Second, </em>No sale in fact ever took place. <em>Third, </em>Had there been a sale under the power, the mortgagees could not have been interested directly or indirectly, in the purchase. The power in the mortgage authorises a private, or public sale, \u201cafter ten days notice to the party of the first part, of such intended sale.\u201d This power must be strictly construed; the notice is a condition precedent to the exercise of the power. Notice of a private sale, must contain the name of the individual purchaser, the price, and day of sale, to enable the party to pay the mortgage in the mean time, if dissatisfied. Notice of public sale, must state time and place, that the party may see to it, and prevent a sacrifice of his property; the object in both cases is to ensure good faith and prevent fraud in the sale; 1 Kent\u2019s Com. 330, 331; Hawkins <em>v. </em>Kemp, 3 East, 410; Doe <em>v. </em>Peach, 2 Maule &amp; Selw. 576; Wright <em>v. </em>Barlow, Ib. 572; Wright <em>v. </em>Wakefield, 17 Ves. 434; Sugden on Powers, 205, 206. 220. 229, 230. 252. No notice was served on Field, the grantor of the power. The notice to Ellet, does not state whether the property will be sold at private sale, or public auction. It states no person, time or place. \u201c On the 1st day of February, <em>or as soon thereafter as convenient,\u201d </em>is not very definite.

The power only authorises a sale for cash. It directs a disposition of the proceeds, after payment of the mortgage. The conveyances were executed solely to make title, and no sale was ever made nor money consideration passed; 4 Kent\u2019s Com. 331. Mortgagees in possession are under like obligations to account for rents, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>&amp;c., as trustees; and cannot purchase the mortgaged property, at a sale made under a power to themselves.

Nor was there any part performance, to take the case out of the statute of frauds; defendants have always treated the mortgage as subsisting.</p>\n<p data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b394-5\">Ellet is one of the trustees; the power is joint, and could not be executed by one; Sinclair <em>v. </em>Jackson, 8 Cow. 544; Woolbridge <em>v. </em>Walker, 3 Bibb, 350; McRea <em>v. </em>Tanner, 4 Har. &amp; Munf. 444; Bergen <em>v. </em>Duff, 4 Johns. Ch. 368. Ellet never did make any contract. The letter of Field, from San Jose, contains a proposition to take the Levee property and cancel the mortgage, and give up the notes. This was never accepted. All the negotiations were broken off, because of the cancellation of the notes and satisfaction on the mortgages; the very conditions named in the letter, were rejected. The statute concerning fraudulent conveyances, sect. 8, page 267, makes every <em>contract </em>for the sale of land <em>void, </em>unless the same be in writing, and submitted by the party making the sale.</p>\n<p data-order=\"88\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b394-6\">There never was any performance to take the case out of the statute. If no contract, there could be no part performance. But his alleged part performance consists, as he alleges, in his taking possession and paying $&gt;700 to Cunningham and Brumagim. Now he and Goodwin took possession as mortgagees, and never relinquished possession. Goodwin says they never relinquished any portion of the property, from the time they went in as mortgagees. And as to the payment of $700, he says Rowe never had <em>one cent; </em>he gave to Goodwin, who paid the money in the first place, Field\u2019s property for the $900; that is, Field paid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>the money; 2 Story\u2019s Eq.

Our statute does not \u201c abridge,\u201d neither does it <em>\u201c </em>enlarge,\u201d the powers of the Courts of Equity, to decree a specific performance of contracts, in cases of part performance; 2 Story\u2019s Eq. Jur. 756, 7, 8. 760. 1, 2. 5 and 6. Defendants have always treated the mortgage as subsisting. The conveyance to Rowe of April 28th, so recites it, and it is under this he holds; and this was executed more than two months after the alleged part performance. As late as May 30th, he published a notice in the Marysville Herald and in the streets, that the sale would be made to <em>\u201c </em>satisfy in part, an amount due me by said Field, on his note and mortgage;\u201d and in June he sells under the mortgage; 3 Barb.

Rep. 308, 9..</p>\n<p data-order=\"89\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b395-4\">If, then, no title passed to Rowe under the conveyance from Goodwin and Ford, nor on the ground of part performance, &amp;c., he still holds as mortgagee; and plaintiffs seek to redeem the property by paying the debt, whatever it may be.</p>\n<p data-order=\"90\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b395-5\">The Court erred in setting aside the report of the referees; because the exceptions were not taken in the progress of the trial, but were drawn up and filed seventeen days after the report had been filed; Tyson <em>v. </em>Wells and Skinner; See Practice Act, sec. 188. But the ground on which it was set aside, is not taken in the exceptions, to wit, that the amount, if not collected by Rowe, is not stated in round numbers, but can only be ascertained from the report by calculation. The reference was made upon consent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"91\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b395-6\">Rowe appealed before the referees, and examined witnesses: in his motion to set it aside, he did not pretend it was not by consent. The objection is too late; 10 Johns. Rep. 486; 10 Wend. 560; 6 Hill, 17; 3 Ib. 221.</p>\n<p data-order=\"92\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b395-7\">The Court erred in ordering the cause to be tried at a continued general term in May. And erred in compelling the plaintiff to take the negative on the trial, because the issues call for proof on the part of the plaintiff in the first instance. And the plaintiffs alleging payment to defendants necessarily had the affirmative; and would have had if the action had been brought by Rowe to enforce the debt from plaintiff.</p>\n<p data-order=\"93\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b395-8\">The Court erred in excluding evidence of the amount of rents Rowe might have received from the mortgaged property, from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>5th April to October 1st, 1851, with ordinary diligence and care.

Rep. 350; Moor <em>v. </em>Cable, 1 Johns. Chan. 388. And in refusing the 8th instruction. The payment of $2000 was made by Ford and Goodwin; Rowe\u2019s proportion was paid by relinquishing to them half of Field\u2019s house. The payment must therefore enure to Field\u2019s and not to Rowe\u2019s benefit.</p>\n<p data-order=\"94\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b396-4\">The Court erred in giving the 1st instruction asked by defendant. Rowe was called on repeatedly for an account of rents, &amp;c., which he refused, insisting on a quit claim deed for the property as a condition\u2014on receiving which, he expressed a willingness to relinquish all personal liability of Field upon the notes. The suit is brought to compel a recognition of plaintiff\u2019s rights, and an account, &amp;c., which Rowe denies and refuses, and sets up his fraudulent acts, which he seeks to sustain, in order to confiscate plaintiff\u2019s rights, &amp;c. It would therefore be inequitable to allow him interest beyond the date of the commencement of the suit. The plaintiff could tender no amount, because Rowe denied that there was any debt, and plaintiff could not ascertain any amount. Defendant cannot, therefore, insist on the enormous rate of in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>terest. To allow him interest for want of a tender would be to allow him to gain by his own wrong.</p>\n<p data-order=\"95\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b397-4\">The Court erred in the form of the judgment. It does not cover the issues. It does not set aside the conveyances of Ford and Goodwin, or of Rowe. It does not decree a cancellation of the mortgages and notes; nor hold the mortgages as subsisting, or the title of the property in the plaintiff; or decree restitution upon payment of the balance; but simply orders a sale of the property to pay the balance. And in allowing interest upon interest at the rate of ten per cent, a month\u2014and in not allowing costs to plaintiff, there was error.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"96\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b397-5\"><em>W.

This cannot be made the subject of review by appellants, for these conveyances were held void by the Court, precisely in accordance with the prayer of plaintiff\u2019s complaint.

Pollock <em>v. </em>Smith and Wilson, Sup. Ct. Cases. But if regular, respondents took these exceptions at the proper time\u2014the grounds of exception only occurred after the trial had concluded. And viewing the report in the light of an award, or special verdict, the exceptions were filed in time. Tidd\u2019s Pract. 442; Ib. 762; 2 Wheat. Rep. 221. 228; Porter (Ala.)

Because a mortgagee is not bound to exercise ordinary care and prudence in the management of mortgaged premises, and Rowe exhibited leases showing the <em>precise amount he actually </em>received. Coots on Mortgages, 152-3; Davy and Barker, 2 Atk. Rep. 2; 1 Yern. 45; Mad. Chan. 533 and 537.</p>\n<p data-order=\"102\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b398-5\">The Court properly refused plaintiff\u2019s first instruction, because at the time this cause was tried, Marysville was not more than three years old; and it can hardly be said, that any custom had become so firmly established, as to govern the construction of contracts. But if so, still Rowe was not bound to let the premises on the most favourable terms\u2014(see authorities last cited.) Was five months an unreasonable time to lease property?</p>\n<p data-order=\"103\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b398-6\">The third instruction asked by plaintiff, even with. the. qualification of the Court, was too strong against defendants. A mortgagee is not even liable for the actual value of the mortgaged premises, but only for the amount of rents and profits received by him; and he is not required to use due diligence in procuring rents, &amp;e., for the property. The only event in which he can be charged with more is, when he is guilty of <em>wilful default. </em>So long as he remains <em>passive </em>he can be chargeable with no neglect. (See last authorities.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"104\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b398-7\">The effect of the qualification was nothing more nor less than to instruct the jury, to add the difference between the actual value of the property and what was received. Appellant was permitted to show what the property would have brought with due diligence. (See folio 414.) The jury could have drawn no other inference than that Rowe had rented for as much as the property was worth, as he at the time thought it his own.</p>\n<p data-order=\"105\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b398-8\">The Court properly refused to recognise the sale to House as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>it was sold for scrip. By the ruling of the Court, this lot is still in Field, and Rowe is responsible to House for the price of it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"106\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b399-4\">The 5th instruction asked by plaintiff, was entirely abstract, . and could have no bearing upon the case; argued as to 1st instruction asked by defendant; Chitty Plead.; Stephen on Plead.</p>\n<p data-order=\"107\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b399-5\">As to the pretended tender of appellants to stop interest, the bare declaration contained in plaintiff\u2019s complaint upon which they urge the fact of tender, does not even approach the requisites of a legal tender. In setting up a tender to stop interest and costs, the party must prove himself ready and willing to pay, &amp;c. A mere question as to how the accounts stood, will not be sufficient; and Field, so far from expressing himself ready to pay, &amp;c., insisted that Rowe was in his debt.

Rep. 348..</p>\n<p data-order=\"108\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b399-6\">As to the objections to the judgment as not cancelling the mortgages, this we say the judgment operates <em>per se. </em>But if not, then this Court, under sect. 8 of the Practice Act, can modify it by ordering the mortgages to be cancelled, &amp;c.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"109\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b399-7\">Heydeneeldt, Justice,</author>\n<p id=\"AJg\">delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Murray, Chief Justice, and Anderson, Justice, concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">Where a power of sale is contained in a mortgage, and under a sale by virtue of such power, the mortgagee becomes the purchaser, the equity of redemption still attaches to the property in favour of the mortgagor.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-9\">The Court below therefore treated this case properly as one in which the plaintiff \u2019a right to redeem was clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-10\">The errors complained of arise mainly upon the charges given and refused by the Court. The first three charges asked by the plaintiffs, were properly refused. The complainant does not charge the defendant Rowe with negligence or improper conduct in leasing the mortgaged premises. It requires him to account for the rent he actually received and no more. But even if he had been called on to answer a charge of that character, the instructions given by the Court were as favourable to the plaintiffs as the rules of law will admit.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>The fourth charge was also properly refused; but the one given by the Court on the question embraced in it, was equally erroneous. The bill did not seek to set aside the sale made to House, and as Rowe had the power to sell, the sale must stand when the mortgagor does not complain of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">As however the defendant Rowe did not affect the sale for money, but received instead an article of fluctuating value, he is clearly chargeable with the highest market value of the property sold, to be credited to the account of the plaintiff; and the Court erred in not so deciding.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">The fifth instruction asked by the plaintiff, was also properly refused. It embraces a question which is entirely abstract, in reference to the facts of this case. It might arise hereafter between Field and the tenant, but can have no place in this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">The sixth instruction asked by the plaintiff, ought to have been given. Where a mortgagee takes possession of the mortgaged premises, his care and trouble are bestowed for the furtherance and protection of his own interests. He is not like a mere naked trustee, nor is his capacity that of an agent. He is, while in possession quasi, its owner. It is a charge which he has taken voluntarily upon himself, and for which he has no right to seek a compensation out of the mortgagor.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">There is but one other error which it seems proper to notice. The Court decided that the defendants held the affirmative, and therefore gave them the opening and conclusion of the causes.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">This was clearly wrong; the plaintiff, always in contemplation of law, has the affirmative, and has the right to open and conclude.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-9\">For the errors that have been pointed out, the judgment is reversed, and the cause remanded with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
