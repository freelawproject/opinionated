The judgment is irregular; for after part of the proofs of the parties only were heard, and the case adjourned for <em>further </em>hearing, the Court, without any further hearing,\u2014and so far as appears, in the absence of appellant\u2014rendered a decision against him.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b510-10\">There is error in according damages for rents and profits, after the commencement of the suit.

No further proceedings were had until the 19th of January, when, on motion of plaintiff\u2019s attorney, the cause was referred, in order to ascertain \u201c the damages sustained by the plaintiff;\u201d and on the 18th of April, the Court entered up the judgment appealed from, upon the facts found by the referee. This proceeding of the Court was irregular. The action is for the recovery of a certain lot of land in the City of Sacramento, and for damages incurred by the use and occupation of the defendant, and is strictly a common law proceeding, and not such a case as would authorize a reference by the Court, without consent of both parties. The case having been submitted to the Court, it was the duty of the Court to find upon facts adduced by the parties, and not the facts presented in a referee\u2019s report.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">The judgment is reversed, and the cause remanded with costs, to the appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
