The defendants appealed. The testimony was annexed to the record: but it does not appear that any exception was taken, nor any motion -made for a new trial.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b79-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number><em>F. W. F. Sloan </em>and <em>J. K. Irving </em>for the appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Azf\">1. The partnership was still subsisting: and there was no dissolution by the decree, nor any settlement or account. 2. Error in the final decree, apparent on the face of the record, will be noticed in an appellate court.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b79-4\"><em>Thomas </em>and <em>Morse, </em>for the respondent.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ab6\">1st. As no motion was made for a new trial, nor any exception taken, the objections of the appellant go only to the sufficiency of the complaint: and by the Practice Act, sec. 45, all objections not raised by answer or demurrer, are deemed waived, except objections to the jurisdiction of the Court, \u201cand that the complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.\u201d The complaint sets forth a good cause of action. 2nd. The evidence justifies the verdict; and the judgment was the only one that could have been rendered on it.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b79-5\">Justice Heydenfeldt</author>\n<p id=\"Ach\">delivered the opinion of the Court. This is an action by one partner against his co-partners. The complaint is too defective to sustain the judgment. It asks for judgment for a particular sum, forming a part of partnership profits; and does not pray for an account of the partnership concerns, nor for a dissolution of the partnership. It is impossible that a correct decision can be attained as to the right of one partner, unless all the partnership transactions are brought before the Court and properly investigated and adjusted.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">The judgment must be reversed, and the case remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">Thursday, February, 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-8\">The Court overruled a petition for a re-hearing, filed by the appellants.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
