The appellants filed a demurrer, on the ground that the facts stated in the complaint disclosed no cause of action against them, &amp;c. The demurrer was overruled; and the appellants failing to answer, the Court heard the plaintiff\u2019s proof, and rendered judgment against the defendants for the amount claimed, and made an. order for the sale of the building, &amp;c. The Rector, &amp;c., appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b83-4\"><em>F. J.

Stats. 1850, p. 212. No such indebtedness being averred, the complaint shows no cause of action against the appellants.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b83-5\"><em>Hawes, Wood </em>and <em>OooJc, </em>for the respondent.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b83-6\">Justice Heydenfeldt</author>\n<p id=\"AYS\">delivered the opinion of the Court. This is an action by a material-man, under the mechanics\u2019 lien law. The object of the plaintiff is to obtain a money judgment against one of the defendants, to whom he sold the lumber, and to have a decree against the other defendants who own the building, for the enforcement of his lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">The statute certainly never contemplated that a lumber merchant should have the right of following the materials which he had sold to another, in general terms, and obtaining a lien upon any building to which the materials had been applied. The language of the act is sufficiently explicit, and must be strictly construed, because it gives rights in derogation of the common law. The materials must not only have been used in the construction of the building, but they must have been, by the express terms of the contract, furnished for the particular building on which the lien is claimed: and to entitle a material man to enforce such lien at law, these terms of the contract must be alleged and proved.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-8\">The declaration in this case avers that the lumber was used in the building, &amp;c. This is not only an insufficient allegation, but, standing by itself, it excludes the conclusion which would be necessary to entitle the plaintiff to recover against the owners of the building. It shows upon its face no right whatever in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>plaintiff, as against the Rector, Wardens, and \"Vestry of Grace Church; and therefore- cannot sustain the judgment against them.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">The judgment against the Rector, &amp;c., is reversed; and the cause remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
