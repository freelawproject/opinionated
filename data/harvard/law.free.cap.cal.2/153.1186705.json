Prayer, that the defendants be required to account, and charged with the damages sustained by their noncompliance with the agreement, and decreed to pay the amount found due the plaintiff; that the partnership be dissolved; and for general relief, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b146-4\">The answer denied the complaint; and alleged that the plaintiff had failed to perform his part of the agreement; and that the defendants had fully paid him his proportion of the profits, &amp;c.; and claimed damages for the plaintiff\u2019s failure to comply with the agreement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b146-5\">The cause was tried by the Court, the parties waiving a jury. A great deal of evidence was adduced. The Court found that the complaint was substantially true; and that upon a settlement of the partnership accounts, the sum of $325.39 was due from the defendants to the plaintiff; and decreed that the plaintiff recover of the defendants the sum found due, with costs; and further, that the partnership be dissolved, and a receiver appointed to take charge of and sell the partnership effects, and bring the proceeds into Court, to abide its further order, &amp;e. The defendants appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b146-6\"><em>Heydenfeldt </em>and Morse, for the appellants,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Axx\">argued that no judgment could be rendered in favour of the plaintiff for any sum certain, until the final adjustment of all the partnership accounts; and that, in this case, such final adjustment still remained to be made, after the disposition of the partnership effects. Grow on Partn. 73-5. They also objected, that the evidence did not warrant the finding of the Court.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b146-7\">\n<em>O\u2019 Conner,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AUD\">in person, cited 2 T.

He also argued, that as there was no case stated, &amp;c., the finding of the Court was conclusive, as to the facts.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b147-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>Chief Justice Murray</author>\n<p id=\"AmR\">delivered the opinion of the Court. This was an action brought by the plaintiff to recover a certain amount of monthly profits, arising from a partnership between himself and the defendants. The Court, sitting as a jury, found the facts as alleged in the plaintiff\u2019s complaint; and upon such finding, decreed a dissolution of the partnership, appointed a receiver to take charge of, cultivate, and sell to the best advantage the growing crop, and pay the proceeds thereof into Court; and rendered a judgment in favour of the plaintiff, against the defendants, for the sum of $325.39. Erom this judgment the defendants appeal, and allege as error, that one partner cannot sue another upon an isolated partnership item; that the Court had no authority to enter judgment for the said sum, except upon a full adjustment of all the partnership accounts; and that the Court had not disposed of the partnership effects, but left them in the hands of the receiver, subject to future distribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">These objections do not apply to this case. The Court have found that the parties were entitled to monthly dividends, by the terms of their contract, and that the sum of $325.39 was due the plaintiff. This was not an amount to be made from the future proceeds of the partnership effects, but was a subsisting liability of the defendants to the plaintiff. Consequently, there was no reason for delaying the plaintiff until the final distribution of the partnership property by the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">As the case was tried by the Court as a jury, we cannot go into the sufficiency of the evidence, but must presume the issues of fact properly found.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">Judgment affirmed, with costs; and the case remanded to the Court below for a final settlement of the partnership effects.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
