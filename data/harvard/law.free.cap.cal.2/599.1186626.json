After signing the agreement, it was agreed that Norman should build the frame of certain increased dimensions specified, for the additional sum of $200, \u201cmaking in all, the full sum of $2450.\u201d This paper is marked, \u201cfiled October 11th, 1852.

R. Turner, Dis. Judge.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b592-13\">The defendant moved the Court to set aside the above judgment, and that the same be expunged from the record. 1st. Because the judgment was entered upon an award made by persons who were not parties to any action or suit in this Court. 2nd. Because there was no suit commenced in this Court, and no complaint or answer served or filed in the same, and this Court have therefore no jurisdiction. 3rd. Defendants were never in Court by themselves or counsel, and had no notice of the in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>tended application for judgment upon the award. The report does not warrant the entry of such judgm\u00e9nt.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b593-4\">The motion to set aside, was overruled by the Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b593-5\"><em>Field, </em>for appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b593-6\">The award is void for uncertainty; it directs payment <em>\u201cagreeable to contract in </em>writing.\u201d The amount to be paid agreeable to contract, could only be ascertained by a jury; from the $2450, for which the building was to be erected, there was to be deducted by the contract, \u201c the moneys and provisions\u201d furnished for the hands, &amp;c. The contract requires payment of the balance only; 2 Halst. 90; 3 Har. &amp; J. 383; U. S. Dig., cases cited, 213; secs. 346, 348, 352.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b593-7\">The award does not conform to the submission, and is void; the arbiters were to inquire <em>\u201cwhether </em>or not <em>Norman was part-owner and proprietor of the said alley,\u201d </em>the only question submitted.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b593-8\"><em>Hager, </em>for respondent.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b593-9\">There is no pretence that the award was made through partiality, fraud or mistake. It is sufficiently certain. The contract was before the arbitrators and the Court. And the award that defendants should pay according to the contract, reduced the amount to a mere matter of calculation. If provisions or money had been paid, defendants might have shown it. Every thing must be intended in favour of an award. Watson on Arb. 209 ; U. S. Dig. 213, secs. 357 and 8, 360, 61, 64, and 394; 2 Wend. 156; 1 McMullan S. Cas. 302. If ambiguous, may be explained by parol; 1 Hill. 489.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b593-10\">Heydenfeldt, Justice,</author>\n<p id=\"AgV\">delivered the opinion of the Court, with which Murray, Chief Justice, and Anderson, Justice, concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-11\">An award, to be effectual, must be certain and conclusive, and all intendments must be in favour of giving it certainty. The Court must lean to such construction as will support it; and the uncertainty, if any, must expressly appear upon its face.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-12\">In the case before us the auditors award, \u201cthat said Norman is not any part-owner or proprietor of said alley; and that said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>Rolfe, Pierson, et al., pay said Norman for said building, agreeable to contract in writing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">The submission left the whole subject-matter in dispute to the arbitrators, and expressly stipulating that their award shall stand as the final settlement of the case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">It is evident, from merely reading the award, that it is uncertain and incomplete, and defeats the object of the submission, which is to make an end of litigation. It has not certainty, to a common intent. It is true there is a contract attached to the exemplification, and marked filed, by the clerk below. This, however, has no verity, and is no part of the record. It is not described in the award, and we cannot know that it is the one referred to. But even if it was a part of the award, the latter would not be aided; for, with both together, the rights of the parties are unascertained.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">The judgment is reversed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
