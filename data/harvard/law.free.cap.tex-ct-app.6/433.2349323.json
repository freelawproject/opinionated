Tried below before the Hon. S. Ford.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b439-19\">The indictment charged that the appellant murdered Charles E. Roberts, in the town of Hearne, Robertson County, on the fifth day of April, one thousand \u201ceiget\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>hundred and seventy-six. A change of venue to Milam County was granted. He was there tried, and a verdict of guilty of murder in the first degree found against him, with the punishment of confinement in the penitentiary for life assessed against him, \u2014 the homicide having been committed before the Constitution of 1876 went into-effect.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b440-5\">The first witness who testified for the State related, in substance, that about three o\u2019clock on the evening of the killing, he saw the deceased, the defendant, and a policeman together. About eight or nine o\u2019clock that night he heard the report of a pistol from a point some hundred yards north of his (witness\u2019s) saloon, where the body of deceased was subsequently found. About five minutes later, defendant came into the saloon alone, and called for a drink. He there and then said that he had just \u201claid a fellow out,\u201d and pulled out a pistol, with which he said he did it. He did not seem to be excited, but somewhat in liquor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b440-6\">The second witness for the State testified that he saw the deceased and the defendant together on the morning of the 4th of April, 1876, and again later in the day, or about three o\u2019clock in the evening. The store of Mr. Morris had been burglarized the night before the killing, and the deceased had got a horse the next morning from a negro boy at Exom\u2019s livery-stable, during the absence of the proprietor, and had gone, it was understood, to a store some seven miles in the country. The defendant and others pursued the deceased, and returned about twelve or one o\u2019clock. About three o\u2019clock, p. M., on the evening of the homicide, Exom said to the defendant, in the presence of the witness, that deceased wanted his money back that he had paid for the hire of the horse; that he was mad because he had been brought back, and had said that he would \u201c fix some of them \u201d if they didn\u2019t let him alone. Defendant replied, \u201cWait until night, and see who will fix him.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b440-7\">A third witness testified that, between the hours of eight <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>and ten on the fatal night, the defendant and the deceased came into his saloon and took a drink together. The deceased seemed to be angry with the defendant. They passed out of the saloon together, and in a very few minutes witness heard the report of a pistol. The report did not sound to witness as coming from the direction in which the body was found.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b441-6\">The essence of Perry\u2019s testimony, for the defence, was that, at seven o\u2019clock on the evening of the killing, he was sent with a message to the defendant by one Brown, for whom the defendant worked. He found him in a saloon, and called him to the door and delivered it. From the-saloon, the defendant accompanied witness and one Murphy to witness\u2019s house, and remained there, without leaving, until half-past eleven o\u2019clock that night. Witness saw two strangers in the saloon spoken of, who left in advance of witness, the defendant, and Murphy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b441-7\">In rebuttal, the State introduced the proprietor of the saloon spoken of by Perry, and he testified that he saw the \u25a0two negroes who looked into the saloqn. They called no one out, that witness heard, but passed on up the street. There were four men besides witness in the saloon at the time, \u2014 defendant and the deceased, and two men asleep. No one went out of the saloon except the deceased and the defendant, and they -went off together, and with no one else.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b441-8\">No brief for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b441-9\"><em>Thomas Ball, </em>Assistant Attorney-General, and <em>W.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"An8\">The defendant was indicted in the District Court of Eobertson County, for the murder of Charles E. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>Roberts, on the fifth day of April, 1876. A change of venue was granted, on the application of defendant. He was tried at the March term, 1879, of the District Court of Milam County, convicted of murder in the first degree, and his punishment assessed at confinement in the penitentiary for life.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">The evidence shows that Roberts was killed in the city of Hearne, in Robertson County, on the night of the 5th of April, 1876. He came to his death from a pistol or gunshot wound. The shot entered the back of the neck, passed through the spinal column and lower part of the head, and the left jaw. The ball with which he was shot was larger than a buckshot. The report of a pistol was heard between the hours of eight and nine o\u2019clock at night, in the direction of where the body of deceased was found in about five minutes afterwards. No eye-witness of the killing was produced.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">The first error assigned is : \u201c The court erred in overruling defendant\u2019s objections to the testimony of Morris, as shown by bill of exceptions.\u201d On the trial of the cause, the State introduced H. Morris as a witness, and asked him to state whether or not, on or about the fourth day of April, 1876, goods were stolen from his store, in the town of Hearne, in Robertson County, and whether, or not, he recovered his goods aftewards, and if he did, to state all about it; to which counsel for defendant objected, because the questions \u25a0did not call for answers that were competent and relevant \u25a0evidence. His objections were overruled, and the witness was permitted to state that his store was broken open by \u00aborne person on the night of the 4th of April, 1876, and a quantity of dry goods stolen; that he made search for his goods next morning, and that there was some excitement in Hearne in consequence; that he got an officer, and started to search some negro cabins ; that they met one Code Brown, who told him he could find his goods, and who introduced Somerville to him ; that Somerville said he and another man <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>were coming into town, late the night before, and they saw two men, who dropped the goods in the street and ran. Witness and defendant then went to a negro cabin; could not get in at the front door, and defendant went round to the rear, and, after a little while, opened the front door. There was a colored girl in the house, and at defendant\u2019s request she opened two trunks and took out the goods which had been stolen from witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">Counsel for defendant objected to this evidence from time to time, as it was given in, because it was irrelevant, incompetent, and calculated to prejudice the minds of the jury against him; which objections were overruled, as appears by his bill of exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">Counsel for the State insist that this evidence was admissible, to show the motive for the crime. When a crime has been proved, and the circumstances point to the accused as the perpetrator, facts tending to show a motive, though remote, are admissible. We have searched the record carefully, and we fail to see that the evidence excepted to has the most remote bearing as tending to show a motive on the part of the defendant to kill the deceased. Proof of a distinct crime, as a general rule, is inadmissible. The goods of Morris were stolen on the night of the 4th of April, and Eoberts was killed on the following night. The acts and conduct of the defendant having relation to the recovery of the stolen property were calculated to produce in the minds of the jurors a prejudice against the defendant, and create the belief that he was a <em>particeps criminis </em>in the theft of Morris\u2019s goods. It neither shed light on the killing of Eoberts, nor strengthens the chain of circumstances connected with the crime for which he was on trial. We believe that the court committed a material error in admitting this evidence. When a defendant is on trial for a capital felony, it is a matter of the highest importance to him that no improper testimony be admitted against him, over his objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>Mr. Wharton says : \u201cIn criminal cases, courts will\"rarely .presume that the particular evidence which has been wrongfully admitted could have no influence on the deliberations of the jury.\u201d Whart. Cr. Law (7th ed.), sect. 3258; <em>Preston </em>v. <em>The Slate, </em>4 Texas Ct. App. 186 ; <em>The People </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>18 Cal. 187; <em>Peek </em>v. <em>The State, </em>2 Humph. 78.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">The evidence set out in the second bill of exceptions was clearly competent. The rule that a party introducing a witness shall not attack his testimony, is so far modified as that any party, when facts stated by a witness are injurious to his cause, may attack his testimony in any other manner except by proving the bad character of the witness. Pasc. Dig., art. 3133.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">In the printed part of the indictment, a typographical error occurs in the alleged date of the offence, making \u201c eight\u201d read \u201c eiget.\u201d It is believed that, as the allegation stands in the indictment, it admits of but one construction, and the intention of the pleader is unmistakable. It is certain and intelligible, the \u201ch\u201d being substituted for the \u201c e \u201d by intendment. It certainly could not have misled the defendant as to what he was called upon to answer, and the conviction had would bar a subsequent prosecution. <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>The State, </em>2 Texas Ct. App. 293; <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>The State, </em>5 Texas Ct. App. 569; <em>Parp </em>v. <em>The State, </em>41 Texas, 487; <em>The State </em>v. <em>Williamson, </em>43 Texas, 501.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">Because the court erred in admitting the evidence set out in the first bill of exceptions, the judgment rendered below is reversed, and the cause remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
