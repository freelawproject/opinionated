The determination by the Family Part that it had jurisdiction to proceed was not a final order and was not appealable as of right. The proceedings should have been conducted expeditiously. However, the parties briefed the appeal as if from a \u201cfinal\u201d order and the issue under review relates to jurisdiction. We grant leave to appeal <em>nunc pro tunc </em>to settle the subject of jurisdiction. <em>R. </em>2:4-4(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b38-9\">The parties were married and lived in Florida. They were divorced by judgment entered in that state on August 15, 1977. Plaintiff was awarded custody of the two minor children of the marriage, and defendant was granted \u201cliberal visitation\u201d. Defendant was ordered to make support payments. Each party was \u201crestrained from permanently removing any of the children from the jurisdiction of the Court without the permission of the other parent or of the Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b38-10\">Subsequently, the children moved with their mother to New Jersey. Defendant challenged the move in Florida and sought additional visitation. The Florida court conducted a hearing and concluded that \u201c[t]he father\u2019s visitation was curtailed and because of the move to New Jersey by the mother with the minor children, the father\u2019s visitation has been totally cut off.\u201d The court also concluded that \u201cin spite of the father\u2019s serious illness he is entitled and indeed must have established for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>himself and the well-being of his minor children, David and Dara, visitation privileges.\u201d Accordingly, by order entered on September 27, 1983, the Florida court directed, among other things, that the defendant be allowed visitation at certain designated times, including holidays, one month during the summer and whenever able to visit the children upon giving reasonable notice. Specifically, the court ordered that \u201cthe father shall be entitled to summer visitation from July 1 to 31st 1984.\u201d The September 27, 1983 order also included the following paragraphs:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-6\">This Court retains jurisdiction for the purposes of enforcing the provisions of this order allowing the father visitation privileges. There is no proof that any State but Florida is the homestate of the minor children.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-7\">Finally, this Court is aware that the mother is seeking the transfer of this case to the New Jersey Courts on the basis of her move to New Jersey. This court does not comment on that matter. It assumes that under the Uniform Child Jurisdiction Custody Act, that if the mother pursues a transfer to the New Jersey Courts, the New Jersey Courts will abide by the act, this Court\u2019s Orders and the Laws of the State of Florida, and will contact this Court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b39-8\">After entry of the September 27, 1983 order, plaintiff moved in Florida for a modification and limitations of its provisions. On July 23, 1984, plaintiffs motion was denied except that the dates for summer visitation in 1984 were amended, with visitation to occur during the month of July in subsequent years unless modified by written agreement. The order of July 23, 1984 further provided that \u201cVisitation shall otherwise be as stated in the Court Order of September 27, 1983.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b39-9\">On November 3, 1983 plaintiff filed a complaint in the Chancery Division, Bergen County, seeking modification of the Florida order of September 27, 1983. That complaint alleged jurisdiction by virtue of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:34\u201431(a)(1)\u2014(3), asserting that New Jersey is the home state of the minor children; that the children have been residents of New Jersey for more than six months and that the \u201cbest interests of the children\u201d requires that visitation be decided here because:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-10\">1. The plaintiff and the children have a significant connection to this state;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>2. There is available in New Jersey substantial evidence concerning the present and future care, protection, welfare and personal relationships of the children;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-6\">3. The children are physically present in New Jersey and it is necessary to protect them, on an emergent basis, from the operation and effect of an order of the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit Court of Palm Beach, Florida, and from the defendant herein.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b40-7\">The complaint also indicated that plaintiff and the children had lived in Fort Lee, Bergen County, New Jersey for two years after having left Florida. Plaintiff further alleged that defendant suffered from a chronic mental illness which posed a \u201cthreat ... to the safety of the children ...\u201d and \u201c... that defendant will seek to disappear with the children, if given that opportunity, or perhaps do them and himself mortal injury.\u201d The complaint, accompanied by a certification, also asserted that \u201cthere should be no visitation whatever until a single, independent court-appointed psychiatrist advised otherwise\u201d and that any \u201c[visitation thereafter should be at plaintiff\u2019s home and supervised.\u201d In essence, plaintiff asked the Chancery Division to exercise jurisdiction pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:34-28 <em>et seq., </em>to enter \u201csuch order or orders as to visitation with the children by defendant as are just and proper in the childrens\u2019 best interest,\u201d and to \u201cmodify the Florida Court\u2019s order of September 27, 1983 to eliminate all visitation by defendant outside plaintiff\u2019s presence and as is in the childrens\u2019 best interests.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b40-8\">On January 13, 1984, the Chancery Division (as of then the Family Part) rendered an opinion indicating that the judge spoke with his counterpart in Florida and further stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Abt\">... it appears that the plaintiff mother seeks to use the New Jersey courts as an appellate vehicle to seek relief from the orders of the Florida court. Judge Wessel [of Florida] and I are in agreement that the standard criteria for the acceptance of jurisdiction in a custody/modification matter does not exist in the instant case. Mrs. Genoe has voluntarily participated in the Florida proceeding and she may not now move from court to court seeking results she finds more desireable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b40-9\">Accordingly, the judge dismissed the complaint, citing <em>E.E.B. v. D.A., </em>89 <em>N.J. </em>595 (1982) and <em>Bowden v. Bowden, </em>182 <em>N.J.Super. </em>307 (App.Div.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>A confirming order was entered on February 6, 1984.</p>\n<p id=\"A-W\">As noted, the litigation in Florida continued. Ultimately, defendant moved there for a change of custody, and plaintiff moved to dismiss the motion. After a hearing, the court entered an opinion and order on October 12, 1984 which stated, in part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-6\">Following the decree ordering that Mrs. Genoe be awarded permanent custody of the two minor children of the parties, Mrs. Genoe, without consent of the Court, removed the children to the State of New Jersey. There followed a Court hearing sometime later, resulting in the Court allowing Mrs. Genoe to continue to reside in the State of New Jersey with the minor children. Mrs. Genoe and the children have resided in New Jersey since approximately 1982. Dr. Genoe has not left the State of Florida____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-7\">The Former Husband has now filed a Motion for Change of Custody of Minor Children/Motion For Change to Joint Custody/Motion to Compel Return of Children to Florida. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-8\">The Former Wife asserts that pursuant to \u00a7 61.1308 Florida Statutes, the Court lacks jurisdiction to rule upon the motion for change of custody and pursuant to \u00a7 61.1316 Florida Statutes, even if the Court does have jurisdiction, it should decline to exercise it in that the State of New Jersey is the more appropriate forum to rule upon the custody question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-9\">The parties have each submitted numerous cases to the Court in support of their respective positions and having considered all of these matters, the Court finds that the question of custody should be resolved in the State of New Jersey because this Court either lacks jurisdiction or the forum is not convenient.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b41-10\">The Florida court considered cases decided in that state under sections of the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act equivalent to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:34-31 (jurisdiction) and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:34-35 (finding of inconvenient forum). The Florida court concluded that New Jersey was \u201cthe home state of the children\u201d (and had been \u201cwithin the six months before the commencement of the proceeding to modify the custody decree\u201d), <em>see N.J.S.A. </em>2A:34-30(e); 2A:34-31(a)(1), \u201cand that the former husband has failed to demonstrate to the Court that it is in the best interest of the minor children\u201d that the Florida court assume jurisdiction. The court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-11\">... the Court finds that it lacks jurisdiction over this cause. Further, the Court finds that even if it has jurisdiction, it should decline to exercise such jurisdiction pursuant to \u00a7 61.1316, Florida Statutes, in that New Jersey is the home state of the children, New Jersey has closer connections with the children and Mrs. Genoe and substantial evidence concerning the children\u2019s present and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>future care, protection, training, and personal relationships is more readily available in New Jersey than in the State of Florida.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">After entry of the October 12, 1984 order in Florida, plaintiff moved before the Family Part for an order reinstating the New Jersey complaint and \u201cfor an order directing that all future and further applications by plaintiff or defendant in the above matter relating in any way, shape or form to the children, be made in the Superior Court of New Jersey, Chancery Division, Family Part, for so long as the State of New Jersey remains the home state of said children.\u201d On February 25, 1985, the Family Part concluded that it had \u201cjurisdiction over the children who had been residents of this state for several years\u201d and that \u201c[t]he removal of the children from the State of Florida to the State of New Jersey was authorized by order of the Florida court dated January 18, 1982.\u201d Based on those findings and the fact that Florida had declined jurisdiction, the Family Part entered its order of February 25, 1985 reinstating the complaint. That order is the subject of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b42-8\">We first deal with defendant\u2019s contention that New Jersey has no <em>in personam </em>jurisdiction. Defendant relies upon <em>Kulko v. California Superior Court, </em>436 <em>U.S. </em>84, 98 <em>S.Ct. </em>1690, 56 L.Ed.2d 132 (1978) in which the Supreme Court held that California had no <em>in personam </em>jurisdiction to require a New York resident to pay support for his daughter who lived with the mother in California. <em>Kulko, </em>of course, did not involve an issue of custody; it concerned only <em>in personam </em>jurisdiction for the purposes of entering a support decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-9\">Jurisdiction in this case is based on the fact that the children live in this state and have lived here by lawful order of the courts of Florida. The action filed in the Chancery Division, while seeking counsel fees, costs and \u201csuch other relief as may be deemed proper\u201d essentially requests modification of a custody award. It does not seek modification of a support order. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>We, therefore, conclude that New Jersey has jurisdiction to enter an order modifying custody or visitation, provided that there is a sufficient statutory basis for doing so, without entering any order amending the Florida support order or otherwise directing defendant to pay costs, fees or support, for which <em>in personam </em>jurisdiction or \u201cminimum contacts\u201d sufficient to satisfy due process, <em>see e.g., International Shoe Co. v. Washington, </em>326 <em>U.S. </em>310, 66 <em>S.Ct. </em>154, 90 <em>L.Ed. </em>95 (1945), would be required. <em>See Shaffer v. Heitner, </em>433 <em>U.S. </em>186, 208, 97 <em>S.Ct. </em>2569, 2581, 53 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>683 (1977) (ftn. 30) <em>McAtee v.

Pratt </em>(R.I.1981), 431 A.2d 405, 409; <em>In re Marriage of Hudson </em>(Ind.App.1982), 434 N.E.2d 107, 119 <em>cert. denied </em>(1983), 459 U.S. 1202, 103 S.Ct. 1187, 75 L.Ed.2d 433; <em>In re Marriage of Leonard </em>(1981), 122 Cal.App.3d 443, 459, 175 Cal.Rptr. 903; Commissioners\u2019 Note, UCCJA \u00a7 12, 9 Uniform Laws Annotated 150 (1979)), because its subject matter, the \u2018custody determination,\u2019 expressly \u2018does not include a decision relating to child support or any other monetary obligation of any person.\u2019 (IIl.Rev.Stat.1981, ch. 40, par. 2103.02.) The UCCJA thus has been found applicable for modifying custody and visitation orders <em>(e.g. In re Custody of Bechard </em>(1978), 40 Colo.App. 516, 577 P.2d 778; <em>Bahr v. Galonski, </em>(1977), 80 Wis.2d 72, 257 N.W.2d 869), but, as in the instant case, not applicable to modify support orders pursuant to its provisions <em>(e.g., Kioukis v. Kioukis </em>(1981), 185 Conn. 249, 440 A.2d 894, 896; <em>Rodgers v. Rodgers </em>(Wyo. 1981), 627 P.2d 1381).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-7\">The custody status of a child or children may be decided <em>quasi in rem (In re Marriage of Hudson, </em>434 N.E.2d at 118; Friedman and Marcus, <em>The Continuing Jurisdiction Dilemma in Interstate Child Custody Disputes, </em>70 Ill.B.J. 304, 305 (1982)), and once that jurisdiction is assumed pursuant to the UCCJA, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>custody and visitation orders can be made and modified without regard to whether either parent has submitted to the court\u2019s jurisdiction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">Accordingly, we hold that <em>in personam </em>jurisdiction is not required to entertain an application to modify an order for custody or visitation under the UCCJA provided that notice and opportunity to be heard are given as required by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:34-32 and -33.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See R. </em>4:4-4; 4:4-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b45-8\">We now turn to the statutory basis for the assertion of jurisdiction. This requires analysis of the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:34-28 <em>et. seq. </em>(UCCJA). That Act seeks \u201cto protect the welfare of children in interstate custody disputes by introducing certainty and stability in the choice of forum and by encouraging interstate cooperation in the interest of the child.\u201d <em>E.E.B. v. D.A., </em>89 <em>N.J. </em>595, 603 (1982). As Justice Pollock pointed out, the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws proposed the Uniform Act</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-9\">in response to the \u2018public concern over the fact that thousands of children are shifted from state to state and from one family to another every year while their parents or other persons battle over their custody in the courts of several states.\u2019 Commissioners\u2019 Prefatory Note to UCCJA, 9 <em>U.L.A. </em>at 111. To avoid jurisdictional conflicts and the accompanying trauma they inflict on the parties, especially the children, UCCJA urges that one state, albeit with help from others, should determine the issue of custody. UCCJA \u00a7 1, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:34-29. <em>[Id. </em>at 607.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b46-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>The UCCJA rejects a rigid rule vesting jurisdiction automatically in the home state and favors, instead, \u201ca more flexible approach.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 610. As Justice Pollock further stated, at page 611:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-6\">A custody dispute is more than a jurisdictional chess game in which winning depends on compliance with predetermined rules of play. A child is not a pawn. In exercising its discretion within the confines of UCCJA ... a court should consider not only the literal wording of the statutes but their purpose: to define and stablize the right to custody in the best interest of the child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-7\">[The Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act of 1980, 28 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1738A] and UCCJA also share a common goal of limiting the ability of sister-states to modify custody decrees. Both statutes permit modification only if the forum has jurisdiction and the rendering state has lost jurisdiction or has declined to exercise it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b46-8\">This is precisely what occurred in this case. Based on the record, including the opinions of the State of Florida, <em>see Evid.R. </em>9, the Family Part properly concluded that it had jurisdiction because New Jersey is the \u201chome state\u201d of the children, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:34-31(a)(1), and because Florida had declined to exercise jurisdiction on the ground that New Jersey was the more appropriate forum, <em>see N.J.S.A. </em>2A:34-31(a)(4)(i). As a result, the Family Part had jurisdiction to modify a custody decree entered in another state because (1) the Florida court had \u201cdeclined to assume jurisdiction to modify the decree,\u201d and (2) the courts of this State had statutory jurisdiction. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:34-42. Unlike <em>Neger v. Neger, </em>93 <em>N.J. </em>15 (1983), here the plaintiff sufficiently proved that Florida \u201chad declined to assume jurisdiction to modify the decree\u201d and that the Superior Court of New Jersey had jurisdiction under the criteria of the UCCJA. <em>See Neger v. Neger, supra </em>at 31. As Justice Schreiber indicated in <em>Neger, </em>there is a difference between exercise of jurisdiction in the absence of a custody decree or ongoing proceedings in another state and the exercise of jurisdiction to modify a decree of another jurisdiction. Not all the statutory criteria and policy considerations are the same. <em>Neger, supra </em>at 27-29.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-9\">Although more than one state may potentially have initial jurisdiction, the litigation invoking original jurisdiction should ordinarily commence in the state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>with which the child and his family have the closest connection and where significant evidence concerning the welfare of the child is more readily available. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:34-34. The UCCJA admonishes the courts to \u2018decline the exercise of [initial] jurisdiction when the child and his family have a closer connection with another state\u2019 <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:34-29(c). The point is that the initial jurisdictional provisions do not come into play when there is a prior custody decree in another state that continues to have jurisdiction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-6\">Two provisions of the statute establish the guidelines concerning the deference to be accorded custody decrees of another state, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:34-41 and -42. These are the key provisions that inhibit child snatching and \u201cguarantee a great measure of security and stability of environment to the \u2018interstate child\u2019 by discouraging relitigations in other states.\u201d <em>[Neger v. Neger, supra </em>at 28-29].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b47-7\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:34-41 requires recognition of out-of-state custody decrees entered in accordance with statutes similar to ours \u201cso long as the decree has not been modified in accordance with jurisdictional standards substantially similar to those of this act.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:34-42, however, permits modification of a custody decree of another state where this state has jurisdiction, and the other state either no longer has jurisdiction or has declined to assume it. In this case, the prerequisites of both <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:34-31 and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:34-42 have been met. There is statutory jurisdiction in New Jersey, and, rightfully or wrongfully, Florida has declined to exercise continuing jurisdiction.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See </em>and <em>compare e.g., L.F. v.

Anderson, </em>345 <em>U.S. </em>528, 73 <em>S.Ct. </em>840, 97 <em>L.Ed. </em>1221 (1953) do not require <em>in personam </em>jurisdiction in these circumstances, see <em>McAtee v. McAtee, supra </em>at 616-618; <em>In re Marriage of Leonard, supra, </em>122 <em>Cal.App.3d </em>at 449-457, 175 <em>Cal.Rptr. </em>903; <em>In re Marriage of Hudson, supra </em>at 117-119. As stated in <em>McAtee, supra </em>at 617:</p>\n<p id=\"b44-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>The basis for most decisions upholding the jurisdictional provisions of the UCCJA is found in the Supreme Court's decision in <em>Shaffer v. Heitner, </em>433 U.S. 186, 97 S.Ct. 2569, 53 L.Ed.2d 683 (1977). In that case the Court abolished the distinctions formerly recognized between actions <em>in rem </em>and actions <em>in personam, </em>and held that the minimum contact standard of <em>International Shoe Co. v. Washington, </em>326 U.S. 310, 66 S.Ct. 154, 90 L.Ed. 95 (1945) applies to both. \u2018[A]I1 assertions of state-court jurisdiction must be evaluated according to the standards set forth in <em>International Shoe </em>and its progeny.\u2019 433 U.S. at 212, 97 S.Ct. at 2584.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-9\">The Court in <em>Shaffer, </em>however, recognized that although the single standard of <em>International Shoe </em>\u2018could be easily applied in the vast majority of cases,\u2019 it could not accommodate all necessary litigation. Thus, the Court carved out certain exceptions from the new rule. The Court wrote: \"We do not suggest that jurisdictional doctrines other than those discussed in text, such as the particularized rules governing adjudication of status, are inconsistent with the standard of fairness.\u2019 <em>Shaffer v. Heitner, supra, </em>n. 30. 433 U.S. at 208, 97 S.Ct. at 2582 n. 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-10\">Footnote 30 of <em>Shaffer </em>has been interpreted as recognizing adjudications of status as an exception to the \u2018minimum contacts' requirement. <em>Hudson v.
