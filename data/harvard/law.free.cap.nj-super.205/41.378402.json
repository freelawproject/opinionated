Most of the factual background is contained in the trial court\u2019s opinions reported as <em>Reiss v. Reiss, </em>195 <em>N.J.Super. </em>150 (Ch.Div.1984) hereafter <em>\u201cReiss </em>I\u201d and <em>Reiss v. Reiss, </em>200 <em>N.J.Super. </em>122 (Ch.Div.1984) hereafter <em>\u201cReiss </em>II\u201d. The husband\u2019s contentions in <em>Reiss I </em>are that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-12\">Point I THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN FIXING THE AMOUNT OF REIMBURSEMENT ALIMONY TO BE PAID BY HUSBAND..........</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-13\">Point II THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN AWARDING WIFE ONE-HALF OF HUSBAND\u2019S SAVINGS ACCOUNT ACQUIRED AFTER THE SEPARATION OF THE PARTIES..............</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>Point III THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN ORDERING HUSBAND TO CONTRIBUTE TO WIFE\u2019S EXPENSES IN OBTAINING A MASTER\u2019S DEGREE IN BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION................</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">In Point I the husband objects to Judge Imbriani\u2019s calculation of $46,706.50 reimbursement alimony as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-7\">... one half of [the wife\u2019s] earnings in Spain used to maintain her husband, or $40,414.50, and one-half of the difference in their earnings during his residency in the calendar years 1979 through 1981, or $6,292. [Reiss I 195 <em>N. J.Super. </em>at 161.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b74-8\">Although the judge\u2019s calculations are not directly contested, Dr. Reiss contends that only one-half of estimated expenses in Spain are reimbursable, excluding estimated vacation expenditures and further excluding any reimbursement for the post-Spain residency period. In our view, plaintiff reads <em>Mahoney v. Mahoney, </em>91 <em>N.J. </em>488 (1982) too narrowly. At page 501 of that seminal case, Justice Pashman states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-9\">To provide a fair and effective means of compensating a supporting spouse who has suffered a loss or reduction of support, or has incurred a lower standard of living, or has been deprived of a better standard of living in the future, the Court now introduces the concept of reimbursement alimony into divorce proceedings. The concept properly accords with the Court\u2019s belief that regardless of the appropriateness of permanent alimony or the presence or absence of marital property to be equitably distributed, there will be circumstances where a supporting spouse should be reimbursed for the financial contributions he or she made to the spouse\u2019s successful professional training. Such reimbursement alimony should cover all financial contributions towards the former spouse\u2019s education, including household expenses, educational costs, school travel expenses and any other contributions used by the supported spouse in obtaining his or her degree or license.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b74-10\">Under the circumstances of this case and substantially for the reasons set forth by the trial judge in <em>Reiss I, </em>we are satisfied that the earnings technique utilized in computing reimbursement alimony was appropriate. There were no children and the couple returned from Spain \u201cwith no savings and minimal personal property,\u201d <em>Reiss I, supra </em>195 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 155. We also approve the differential earnings technique used for Dr. Reiss\u2019 residency period, which is really an extension of his \u201csuccessful professional training\u201d as contemplated to be within the scope of a reimbursement alimony period in <em>Mahoney, supra </em>91 <em>N.J. </em>at 501. The difficulty in calculating a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>supporting spouse\u2019s \u201ccontributions\u201d toward a former spouse\u2019s education, or the amount of appropriate reimbursement alimony, is apparent from the figures supplied the court by the parties. The wife sought $40,414.50, or one-half of her $84,329 earnings in Spain less $3,500 used for vacations, when the husband earned virtually nothing. For this period the husband suggested $8,030.50 or one-half of certain estimated expenses of $16,061 for rent, utilities, food costs, etc. The record contains no explanation of the difference between the wife\u2019s earnings of $84,329 and the $16,061 except some estimates for vacations, movies, ballet, etc. Since there were no savings and minimal personal property upon the couple\u2019s return from Spain, the only reasonable conclusion is that the pair otherwise spent the money for undocumented living expenses. In any event, to the extent the differential may have been expended for things like social security taxes creditable only to the wife and not deemed properly includable in reimbursement alimony, we are satisfied they are roughly offset by the delay in reimbursement of the wife, between the earnings periods from 1973 through part of 1978 and the date the monthly payments would have terminated in 1986 without interest.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In other words, the time value of money is not included in the calculation of reimbursement alimony although the remedial concept of such alimony recognizes financial contributions of the supporting spouse as a loss of an investment in future material benefits. The same analysis is applicable to the residency period from 1979 through 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">Point II is really an objection to a portion of the equitable distribution of all property of the parties that had been acquired prior to the filing of the divorce complaint. Here we are satisfied that the trial court\u2019s findings of fact are adequately supported by evidence and all related issues of law raised are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>clearly without merit. The judgment in this respect is accordingly affirmed. <em>R. </em>2:11-3(e)(1)(A) and (E).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">In Point III of <em>Reiss I </em>the husband objects to the trial judge\u2019s determination that he pay one-half of the wife\u2019s \u201ctuition, books, college fees and transportation expenses\u201d if she pursues an MBA degree by the summer of 1986. Judge Imbriani denied permanent alimony and rehabilitative alimony, but found that the wife \u201cis entitled to receive funds from the marital assets before distribution to enable her to complete her education ... [because] . . . . The husband used marital assets to educate and advance himself and she is entitled to do likewise.\u201d <em>Reiss I, supra </em>195 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 156. We disagree with Judge Imbriani\u2019s analysis because the reimbursement alimony has already returned to the wife her one-half of the marital assets expended for the husband\u2019s education in Spain and the subsequent residency. Although the judge\u2019s opinion suggests that this unliquidated amount should be reserved from the marital assets before the balance is equitably distributed, the nature and rationale of such allowance contradicts the finding that rehabilitative alimony is unwarranted in the circumstances of this case. This portion of the divorce judgment is therefore reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-9\">On March 17, 1984, less than two months after the judgment of divorce, Sherry Reiss married Daniel Brosnahan. Plaintiff, Dr. Reiss, had made the February 1 and March 1, 1984 reimbursement alimony payments and thereafter Judge Imbriani denied his motion to terminate such payments upon the remarriage. In <em>Reiss II, supra, </em>the judge concluded, in effect, that reimbursement alimony is <em>sui generis </em>and \u201cneither alimony nor a marital asset.\u201d He concluded that reimbursement alimony was a flexible concept and that under the circumstances of this case termination upon remarriage would be inappropriate. The issue presented on this appeal is the degree of finality or permanency to be accorded an award of reimbursement alimo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>ny\u2014which was specifically reserved for future determination in <em>Mahoney, supra </em>91 <em>N.J. </em>at 503 n. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">Courts throughout the country have struggled with the problems resulting from the divorce of a professional person following a supporting spouse\u2019s financial contributions to the educational attainments of such professional. In addition to the cases cited in <em>Mahoney, supra, </em>see generally, Note \u201cTraditional Alimony Can Be Restructured to Provide Reimbursement to a Spouse Who Supports His or Her Partner in the Quest for an Advanced Degree\u201d, 14 <em>Seton Hall Law Rev. </em>437 (1984). See also <em>Lovett v. Lovett, </em>688 <em>S.W.2d </em>329 (Ky.1985); <em>Lehmicke v. Lehmicke, </em>339 <em>Pa.Super. </em>559, 489 A.2d 782 (1985); <em>Washburn v. Washburn, </em>101 <em>Wash.2d </em>168, 677 <em>P.</em>2d 152 (1984). The inter-relationship of conventional alimony, rehabilitative alimony, reimbursement alimony and equitable distribution of property is evident from <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:34-23 and the trilogy of <em>Mahoney, supra; Hill v. Hill, </em>91 <em>N.J. </em>506 (1982); and <em>Lynn v. Lynn, </em>91 <em>N.J. </em>501 (1982). Although we concur with the result reached in <em>Reiss II, </em>we believe that the New Jersey Supreme Court used the term advisedly when it introduced the concept of reimbursement alimony in <em>Mahoney, supra </em>91 <em>N.J. </em>at 501. As such, it is alimony\u2014subject to revision and alteration \u201cfrom time to time as circumstances may require\u201d as provided in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:34-23 and not dischargeable in bankruptcy (see <em>Lynn, supra </em>91 <em>N.J. </em>at 515, n. 1. It does not follow, however, that reimbursement alimony must terminate upon remarriage of the spouse receiving such payments. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:34-25 antedates the concepts of reimbursement and rehabilitative alimony. Furthermore, this statute speaks only to conventional alimony, referring specifically to \u201cthe payment of money for the support of the former wife.\u201d We also concur in the determination below that under the facts and circumstances of this case the reimbursement alimony should not terminate upon Mrs. Reiss\u2019 marriage to Mr. Brosnahan.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>In summary, we affirm all determinations by Judge Imbriani except as to Point III in <em>Reiss I. </em>We remand to the trial court solely for the purpose of entering an amended judgment of divorce deleting the requirement that Dr. Reiss reimburse Mrs. Brosnahan for any expenses of obtaining an MBA degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">No costs or counsel fees on this appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b75-7\">The total reimbursement alimony of $46,706.50 was payable under the January 26, 1984 dual judgment of divorce at the rate of $1500 per month without interest (except for late payments) beginning February 1, 1984.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
