Although the report of an orthopedist for the defendant Gilberto Sanchez set forth in degrees the results of his range of motion testing of the plaintiff, he did not compare those findings to a normal range of motion. \u201cThus, the defendants\u2019 proof failed to objectively demonstrate that the plaintiff did not suffer a permanent consequential or significant limitation of use of [her] cervical as a result of the subject accident\u201d <em>(Aronov v Leybovich, </em>3 AD3d 511, 512 [2004]; <em>see also Claude v Clements, </em>301 AD2d 554 [2003]).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">In light of our determination, the remaining issues have been rendered academic.
