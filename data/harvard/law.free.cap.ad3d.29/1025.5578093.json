The charges arose from deviate sexual acts committed with a male cousin over a two-year period, and an incident in which defendant masturbated in front of that 12-year-old victim and several of his friends. In 2002, defendant appeared in County Court for a risk level determination pursuant to the Sex Offender Registration Act <em>(see </em>Correction Law art 6-C). The risk assessment instrument prepared by the Board of Examiners of Sex Offenders assigned defendant a total of 80 points, and recommended an upward departure from the presumptive risk level II to level III. The case summary justified the upward departure with the aggravating fact that defendant\u2019s 1990 conviction in Pennsylvania for indecent exposure and open lewdness, to which he had pleaded nolo contendere, arose from him stalking, and masturbating in front of, a 12-year-old boy. The case summary further recited a list of materials\u2014including photographs of children, a list of elementary schools and a list of people involved in a sex ring\u2014that were seized from defendant\u2019s home following his arrest. The presentence investigation report and the police report, which included the State Police investigation as well as statements by the victim, witnesses and defendant, were submitted to County Court. Defendant testified at the risk assessment hearing, during which he offered innocent explanations for the inculpatory materials that were seized, attempted to minimize his sexual contact with his cousin and blamed his Pennsylvania conviction on his attorney. County Court rejected defendant\u2019s testimony as incredible, characterizing it as \u201cmanipulative, cunning and deceptive,\u201d concluded that defendant \u201ccontinues to suffer a bizarre sexual obsession for young children for which he has no genuine intent or desire to seek treatment,\u201d and expressed doubt that defendant would avoid future contact with young <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1027\">*1027</page-number>children. County Court adjudicated defendant to be a risk level III offender, and defendant now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-4\">Defendant contends that County Court\u2019s upward departure from the presumptive risk level II assessment was not supported by clear and convincing evidence. In light of County Court\u2019s ability to observe the demeanor of a witness at a hearing, its credibility determinations are accorded great deference <em>(People v Hunter, </em>270 AD2d 712, 713 [2000]), and its findings will be reversed only if \u201cthe record reveals that the court clearly erred in its resolution of the credibility issues\u201d <em>(People v Earley, </em>244 AD2d 769, 770 [1997]). Inasmuch as defendant\u2019s rambling testimony offered only implausible explanations and excuses, we find no clear error in County Court\u2019s rejection of that testimony. Further, there is no requirement that County Court\u2019s conclusions regarding defendant\u2019s propensity to commit sexual offenses or his lack of willingness to undergo treatment be supported by expert testimony. Rather, the risk level determination must be supported by facts that have been established by clear and convincing evidence, and those facts may be offered in the form of reliable hearsay, including the case summary and other materials upon which County Court relied <em>(see </em>Correction Law \u00a7 168-n [3]; <em>People v Dickison, </em>24 AD3d 980, 981 [2005], <em>lv denied </em>6 NY3d 709 [2006]; <em>People v Ashley, </em>19 AD3d 882, 883 [2005]; <em>see also People v Brown, </em>25 AD3d 924, 925 [2006]). Here, the documents submitted to County Court, particularly when considered with defendant\u2019s evasive testimony at the hearing, provide clear and convincing evidence that defendant is a pedophilic sex offender and that he is unlikely to volitionally undergo counseling to address his conduct. Accordingly, we find no basis to disturb County Court\u2019s determination that defendant is a risk level III sex offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-5\">Crew III, J.P., Peters, Carpinello and Lahtinen, JJ., concur. Ordered that the order is affirmed, without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
