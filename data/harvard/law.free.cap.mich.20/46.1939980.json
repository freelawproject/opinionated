The defendants objected that \u201c the paper is variant from the contract described in the declaration, and because the defendant, Christopher J. Dickerson, is not a joint contractor in said paper, nor an original maker, and cannot be sued with the defendant Daniel Bolles, he not being a joint contractor with the said Daniel Bolles.\u201d The Circuit Judge sustained the objection and rejected the evidence as inadmissible, to which the plaintiffs excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b48-7\">The verdict having been found for the defendants, the judgment entered thereon is brought into this Court by writ of error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b48-8\"><em>G. A. Knickerbocker and A, Dickerman, </em>for plaintiffs in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b48-9\">I. The undertaking of the defendant in error, Dickerson, by the terms of his agreement, is an original one and the action is properly brought against both defendants in error, Dickerson and' Bolles. Dickerson is a surety and not a guarantor. The terms surety and guarantor have acquired a fixed signification, and when used are decisive of the nature of the contract. To be security in a contract is equivalent to becoming a party to it m the character of a surety. <em>Norris v. Spencer, 18 Maine, p. 824 p BurrilVs Law Dictionary </em>\u2014 \u201c <em>Security </em>; \u201d \u201c <em>Guaranty.\u201d</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b48-10\">In this case the language of the agreement of the defendant in error, Dickerson, is equivalent to his signing his name immediately under that of the defendant Bolles, and adding the word \u201c surety.\u201d <em>Norris v. Spencer, 18 Maine, 324; Hunt, Administrator, v. Adams, 5 Mass., 358. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>Dickerson\u2019s agreement was contemporaneous with the contract signed by Bolles, and they are parts of the same transaction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b49-5\">II. The defendant in error, Dickerson, can make every defence in this suit, that he could have made, had an action been brought against him alone. As in case of recoupment, courts of law seek to avoid circuity of action and a multiplicity of suits, and in this suit the rights and equities of the parties could be much better settled in one suit than two. <em>Norris v. Spencer, 18 Maine, 324; Allen v. Hubert, 49 Penn. St. 259.</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b49-6\"><em>G. J. Dickerson and B. W. Ricdby, </em>for defendants in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b49-7\">The contract offered in evidence on the trial of this cause executed by the plaintiffs in error, and the defendant in error, Bolles, is not an original undertaking on-the part of the said Dickerson, but merely collateral. <em>2 Pars, on Gont. pp. 9, 12 ; Tilleston v. Nettlston, 6 Pick., 509; Nelson v. Boynton, 3 Met., 396; Tinker v. McCauley, 8 Mich., 180; Rapelye v. Bailey, 3 Conn., 438; 5 Conn., 149; Dale v. Young, 24 Pick., 250; Thaxton v. Bugbee, 5 Cush., 221; Bunt v. Horton, 1 Met., 24.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b49-8\">The undertaking signed by the said defendant in error, Dickerson, is merely that of a guarantor, and he could not therefore be joined in a suit with the said Bolles.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b49-9\">The agreement made and signed by the plaintiffs in error, and the defendant in error, Bolles, bears date on the 7th of September, and specifies clearly and distinctly what each party is to do. Although the agreement may not have been executed on the day it bears date, it should be treated as the agreement of the parties on the day it bears date, because they adopted that as the day of their agreement. It was clearly the intent of the parties to adopt the 7th and the 15th as the dates of the respective undertakings and therefore were not contemporaneous.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b49-10\">The undertaking signed by Dickerson does not appear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>to be based upon tbe same consideration as the one signed by Bolles. The consideration upon which Bolles undertook to perform certain labor, was the payment of money. The words \u201cfor value received,\u201d in the undertaking signed by Dickerson, seem to indicate a different and independent consideration from the one expressed in the agreement signed by Bolles; and the words \u201cforegoing contract,\u201d indicate clearly that the parties considered the undertakings separate and distinct from each other. <em>Nelson v. </em>Boynton, <em>3 Met., Bainridge, 6 Blackford, 12; Chitty on Contracts, p. 397.</em></p>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b50-5\">Guayes, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">The plaintiffs in error sued the defendants jointly in <em>assumpsit, </em>and in stating their cause of action set forth an agreement in writing dated the seventh of September, 1868, between the defendant Bolles of <em>the </em>first part and the plaintiffs.of the second part, by which Bolles in consideration of the agreement by the plaintiffs to pay him a specified price promised the plaintiffs that he would, in a particular manner and by a specified time, remove a dwelling house, mentioned' in the agreement, and perform certain work upon and about said building. The declaration further set forth that such contract was executed on the 15 th of September, 1868, and that at such time the defendant Dickerson, executed and delivered to the plaintiff a certain paper writing in the words and figures following, that is to say: \u201cFor value received I hereby agree to become surety for the performance of the foregoing contract by the said Daniel Bolles. September 15 th, 1868. 0. J. Dickerson.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">The declaration then proceeded to aver a breach of the agreement, to perform the specified labor in and about the dwelling house, and claimed of the defendants a large amount of damages as resulting from such breach.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-8\">The defendants having pleaded the general issue, the parties went to trial before a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>The plaintiffs proved the execution of the two instruments set forth in the declaration, and that both were executed on the same day, and then offered them in <em>evidence; </em>but their introduction was resisted by defendants\u2019 counsel on the ground, among others, that defendant, Dickerson, was not a joint contractor with defendant. Bolles, and that the defendants were not jointly liable. The Circuit Judge sustained the objection, and excluded the evidence, whereupon a verdict passed for defendants, and the question for us is whether this ruling of the Court helow was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">It is not deemed necessary to the determination of this question to discuss the distinction between the contracts of guarantee and suretyship, or to dwell upon the consequences flowing from such distinction. What we have to decide is, whether the plaintiffs by their declaration disclosed and set forth a joint undertaking on the part of defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">On a written agreement parties can only be sued in the manner in which they have made themselves liable, and whatever difficulty there is in ascertaining who are proper parties to be sued, must arise from an ambiguity in the writing. <em>Barlour on Parties, j&gt;. 118.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">But whatever the difficulty in deciding who ought to be made parties, and who may be joined as defendants, it is incumbent upon the plaintiff, when he proceeds against two or more to show by his declaration that the defendants are jointly liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-8\">It is generally true that this will sufficiently appear when the declaration follows the words of the contract; but there are cases, and this appears to be one of them, where a simple transcription of the writings by the pleader will not suffice.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-9\">We think it was, at least, indispensable to a joint liability on the part of these defendants, that the two instruments signed by them respectively should not only have been contemporaneously executed, but that they should likewise have been made upon the same consideration. But whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>appearance of these requisites would have been sufficient to show a joint liability, is a matter on which we express no opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">The declaration avers that they were executed simultaneously, but it altogether omits to aver that the undertakings of defendants were upon the same consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">We cannot regard the acknowledgment of \u201cvalue received]\u201d in the instrument signed by Dickerson, as implying the same consideration for his promise, as that upon which the defendant Bolles undertook to perform the services specified in the other <em>writing; </em>and hence the declaration wholly fails in stating a 'cause of action against the defendants, involving a joint liability on their part.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">We think, therefore, that the ruling of the Court below was right, and that the judgment should be affirmed with costs.</p>\n<judges id=\"b52-8\">The other Justices concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
