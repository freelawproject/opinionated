That three thousand dollars, the whole, exceeds and is greater than one hundred dollars, one of its parts, neither requires nor admits of proof. The Circuit Court is a court of common law and general jurisdiction, and jurisdiction will be presumed until the contrary is <em>shown. </em>\u2014 Greenvault <em>v. F. &amp; M.

Pray, </em>for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b266-8\">The affidavit is insufficient to give the Court jurisdiction. It must, upon its face, show <em>a mm certain </em>within the jurisdiction of the Court, and affirmatively show, <em>prima facie, </em>that the affiant <em>has the means </em>of stating that sum certain \u201cas near as may be.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AuD\">It is not swearing or proving that the amount <em>is </em>so much, \u201c as near as may be,\u201d and the question 'is to prove <em>what </em>the amount\u2019 is \u201c as near as may be \u201d before it is ascertained by legal adjudication. The matter must be shown by affidavit <em>so that it appears, prima facie, </em>that the amount is set forth as near as may <em>be. </em>\u2014 1 <em>Hill, 204, 206 ; 3 McLean, 326; 6 Hill, 314; 20 N. Y., 354; 25 N. Y., 624 ; 7 Hill, 187; Lothrop et al. v. Snyder, 16 Wis., 293. </em>\u2014 The language of the statute is that the plaintiff, or some one in his behalf, shall make an affidavit <em>stating </em>that the defendant therein <em>is </em>indebted to the plaintiff and <em>specifying </em>the amount \u201cas near as may be.\u201d If the amount be not over $100, the Circuit would not have jurisdiction by the Con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number><em>stitution. </em>\u2014 Const., \u00a7 <em>18, art. 6. </em>\u2014 And the writ would be expressly forbidden by the statute. \u2014 \u00a7 <em>4145 Comp. Laws, p. 1270.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b267-5\">The proceeding by attachment is a harsh remedy, statutory in character, and is to be construed <em>accordingly. </em>\u2014 2 <em>Mich;, 418; 1 Doug. 380, 850 ; 2 Doug. 98, 498 ; 3 Mich., 277, 535; 5 Mich., 98, 409 ; 8 Mich., 64; 10 Mich., 264, 409. </em>\u2014 \u00a7\u00a7 <em>4148 and 4145 </em>are to be considered together, and they show plainly with what care the Legislature guarded against abuse and sought to confine parties adopting the remedy to the jurisdiction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b267-6\">That the affidavit is a <em>jurisdictional prerequisite, </em>is apparent from the statute and cases cited. The <em>jurisdiction </em>is made to depend upon the <em>amount, and that </em>is to be <em>shown </em>by affidavit, before the writ can lawfully issue. The <em>amount </em>is to be <em>shown </em>\u201c as near as it can be.\u201d This is the <em>end </em>required, and the party must see to it that the means are adequate. If the required affidavit could not be made, the plaintiff would not be legally \u201centitled to the benefit of the <em>action.\u201d </em>\u2014 2 <em>Mich., 329.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b267-7\">The language and <em>object </em>of the statute are to be observed. The amount is to be \u201cspecified as near as may be,\u201d and <em>there is no qualification </em>in the statute and none can be imported into <em>it. </em>\u2014 12 <em>Adol. &amp; Ellis, 468; 8 Queen\u2019s B. 920; 4 Scott, N. C., 581; 2 Adol. &amp; Ellis, 875 ; 4 </em>Scott, <em>N. C., 188 ; 1 Strange, 69. </em>\u2014 The language is <em>not </em>that the amount is to be specified as <em>near </em>as it may be stated by any one <em>willing to make the affidavit, </em>or as near as any one may be <em>able </em>to state it, but the person who does make it must be <em>able </em>to specify it \u201cas near as may be,\u201d and it ought to appear affirmatively on the face of the affidavit, <em>prima facie, </em>that the affiant <em>is </em>able and <em>does specify </em>the amount \u201c as near as may <em>be.\u201d </em>\u2014 1 <em>Hill, 204, %06. </em>\u2014 As to the certainty required in <em>affidavits: </em>\u2014 8 <em>Caines\u2019 Rep., 105; 1 Chitty\u2019s Rep., 831; 18 E. C. L., 99.</em></p>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b268-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>Graves, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">In this case the only question is upon the sufficiency of an affidavit upon which an attachment issued under chapter 140 of the Compiled Laws. The Court below dismissed the writ, upon the ground, that the affidavit was fatally defective, and the plaintiff assigns this for error.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">The statute allowing the proceeding by attachment provides among other things, that the plaintiff,- or some one in his behalf shall <em>\u201c </em>make and annex to the writ an affidavit <em>stating that the defendant is indebted to the plaintiff, and specifying the amount of such indebtedness as near as may be over and above all legal set offs,\u201d &amp;c. </em>\u2014 \u00a7 <em>IflliS Com. L. </em>\u2014 And further <em>that no writ shall be issued \u201c unless the amount stated in such affidavit \u201d </em>shall <em>exceed </em>the sum of one hundred dollars. \u2014 \u00a7 <em>Iff Iff Com. L.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">By a series of decisions this' Court has determined that the statutory requirements respecting the affidavit must be strictly complied with.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">Guided by the spirit of these decisions, by the nature of the proceeding, and the phraseology of the law, I have been led to conclude, that in order that a party may avail himself of this remedy, it must be shown affirmatively and positively on the face of the affidavit, that a sum certain above one hundred dollars, is due to the plaintiff over and above all legal set offs; and that the sense and meaning of the statute will not allow the employment of the words of the provision, or words of equivalent import. I have supposed that the paragraph requiring the affiant to specify the amount, was intended to point out the <em>end </em>to be accomplished; and not to prescribe a <em>formula </em>for the affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-9\">According to this view an affidavit in the words of the statute, or otherwise drawn with some qualification, which must leave the Court uninformed by the oath of the affiant as to his ability to state the real amount, would be defective in a jurisdictional point: the Court would neither <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>have a positive statement of the amount, nor any evidence, on oath, as to the circumstances covered by the qualification, or the interpretation put upon it by the affiant.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">The affidavit in the present case states that the defendant is indebted to the plaintiff in the sum of three thous- and dollars, \u201c as near as can be specified by this deponent,\u201d and since the Court could not know the ability of the affiant to fix the real amount, in the absence of any showing on that subject, it has seemed to me that the qualification in the affidavit, left the- proof essentially defective.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">My brethren, however, think differently. They are satisfied that a construction which would make this affidavit insufficient on the ground mentioned, would conflict with the practice of the courts, and the uniform opinion of the bar, for the whole period in which the proceeding by attachment has been authorized. And they are likewise of opinion, that the affidavit substantially meets the design of the statute, and proves with reasonable certainty, for the purpose of authorizing the writ, that there was an amount exceeding one hundred dollars due from the defendant to the plaintiff, when the affidavit was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">From this it follows that the judgment of the Court below must be reversed with costs.</p>\n<judges id=\"b269-8\">The other Justices concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
