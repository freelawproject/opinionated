Upon the trial of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>the cause, the plaintiff offered evidence to show that in the spring of 1867, she sold the defendant a yoke of oxen, and for the price of one hundred dollars. To the admission of this evidence the defendant objected that such proof was not competent under the declaration, \u2014 there being no count in said plaintiff\u2019s declaration charging defendant with said cattle. The Circuit Judge overruled the objection, and received the evidence, to which decision the - defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b354-5\">A 'judgment having been rendered for the plaintiff below on this evidence, the defendant removes the record to this Court by writ of error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b354-6\"><em>Grofoot &lt;&amp; Brewer, </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b354-7\">It is a general rule that in pleadings, words must be construed according to their general acceptation.\u2014 # <em>GMtty Pleading, 218. </em>\u2014 We think the words, <em>goods, wares </em>and <em>merchandise, </em>cannot include <em>cattle </em>or <em>oxen j </em>that neither of said words in their general acceptation, include <em>animate </em>objects. Bouvier says \u201cthe term <em>chattels </em>is more comprehensive than that of <em>goods, </em>and will include all <em>animate </em>as well as <em>inanimate </em>property. \u2014 <em>1 Bouvier's Diet., 608, title goods. </em>\u2014 All our forms of pleading seem to indicate that where a party seeks to recover for <em>cattle </em>sold and delivered under the common counts, it is necessary to use the words <em>cattle </em>or <em>chattels, </em>or something more comprehensive than that of <em>goods, wares </em>and <em>merchandise. </em>\u2014 <em>1 Ghitty\u2019s Pleading, 54-</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b354-8\">Mr. Chitty says, \u201cIt seems that the price or value of <em>fixtures, </em>and perhaps <em>crops, </em>sold, may be recovered under the common count, provided there be inserted therein, besides the word <em>goods, </em>the term, <em>fixtures, crops, chattels, effects, &amp;c. </em>If <em>cattle </em>were sold, that word should be introduced into the count; though the word <em>chattels, </em>which includes <em>animate </em>as well as inanimate things, would suffice.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>Nor, he says, is the price of <em>fixtures </em>or <em>cattle </em>recoverable, it seems, under a count for <em>goods </em>sold; the words, <em>chattels, fixtures, cattle </em>and <em>effects, </em>should be added.\u2014 <em>Ghitty on Gont., </em>\u2014Neither do the words, <em>goods, wares </em>and <em>merchandise, </em>include <em>building materials. </em>\u2014 6 <em>Taunton, 825; Ghitty on Gont., </em>ifi2.\u2014 \u201cMovables consist of, \u2014 first, <em>inanimate </em>things such as <em>goods, </em>plate, money, jewels, &amp;e.; and secondly, <em>animate </em>things, as animals, <em>&amp;c.\u201d </em>\u2014 2 <em>Stephen\u2019s Com., 67.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b355-6\"><em>Williams on Executors, vol. 2, 10H, </em>speaking of what property passes in a devise, under particular words, says, the word, <em>\u201cgoods,\u201d </em>is <em>nomen generalissimum, </em>and when construed in the abstract, will comprehend all the personal estate of the testator, as stocks, bonds, notes, wares, plate, furniture, &amp;c. And to sustain the above principle, the author <em>cites </em>\u2014 Ryal <em>v. Rolle, 1 Atk., 180, 2; Crichton v. Symes, 3 ib. 62; Stukey v. Stukey, 1 Hill S. C. Ch. 309.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b355-7\">None of the above cases go far enough to sustain the broad doctrine laid down in the text; and we have been unable to find any case holding that the word <em>goods, </em>in its general acceptation, includes <em>animate </em>objects. It is true that the word <em>goods, </em>in <em>wills, </em>has at times a very broad signification, but its meaning is generally limited or enlarged by the context of the will; and in pleadings, there is no such controlling influence, and the word must be used in its general acceptation.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b355-8\"><em>A. G. Baldwin, </em>for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b355-9\">The words \u201cgoods, wares and merchandise\u201d are very general in their character, and, as I believe, comprehend all property of a personal nature. The usual printed forms of the common counts of a declaration contain only the word \u201c goods,\u201d and the word \u201c chattels,\u201d is seldom or never found. The word \u201cgoods,\u201d was sufficiently comprehensive to entitle the plaintiff by law to recover.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b355-10\">In Webster\u2019s Dictionary, edition of 1856, \u201c Goods,\u201d is de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>fined as \u201cpersonal or movable estate as horses, cattle, utensils, etc.; and in the edition of 1864, the word is defined as \u2014 \u201ca valuable possession or piece of property; goods, wares, commodities, chattels.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b356-5\">In Worcester\u2019s Dictionary, the word is defined as, \u201cthe term goods comprehends a person\u2019s furniture, and other movable and personal property; cattle, implements of husbandry, etc.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b356-6\">At one time it was supposed that shares in an incorporated company were not included in these terms, and the twelve Judges were equally divided upon the question. The question has since been settled in England, that shares are included under the term <em>\u201cgoods.\u201d </em>\u2014 Picker<em>ing v. Appleby, Comyn\u2019s Rep., 354 </em>\u2014 But by the whole current of American authorities, that question is now finally settled. \u2014 In <em>Tisdale v. Reed, 20 Pick., 13, </em>the question was fully examined by the Court, Chief Justice Shaw giving the opinion.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b356-7\">It will be considered that this was an action brought before a Justice of the Peace. No bill of particulars was called for, and no demurrer or objection interposed to the looseness or generality of the declaration. Declarations in Justices\u2019 Courts have always been <em>favored. </em>\u2014 People <em>v. Foote, 1 Doug., 102; Hartford v. Holmes, 3 Mich., 460.</em></p>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b356-8\">Grates, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b356-9\">The defendant in error prosecuted Weston before a Justice, and declared orally for the price of goods, wares and merchandise, sold and delivered, and having recovered judgment, Weston appealed to the Circuit Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-10\">The declaration remaining as it was before the Justice, the plaintiff in error pleaded the general issue thereto in that court, and the parties proceeded to trial on that issue. The defendant in error, under objection, gave in evidence the sale by her to Weston of a yoke of oxen, and judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>again passed for defendant in error. The only question is, whether the sale of the oxen was provable under the pleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">It is claimed on the part of Weston, that the phrase \u201cgoods, wares and merchandise\u201d did not authorize proof of the sale of animate property, and that the word \u201cchattels\u201d or \u201ccattle\u201d or some equivalent or equally comprehensive word or term was needed to admit of such evidence as was given on the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">There has been some diversity of opinion as to the legal scope in pleading, in criminal as well as civil cases, of the words \u201cgoods, wares and merchandise;\u201d and some writers of authority have supposed it to be necessary, or at least the safer course, to use the word \u201c chattels \u201d in the common count, when the price of cattle is sought to be recovered; and it is possible, that in earlier times, when the rules of pleading were much more technical than at present, and the meaning of \u201c goods and merchandise \u201d according to general and approved usage, was somewhat more narrow than it has beeome since, it was necessary to take the precaution suggested.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">There seems, however, to be no good ground, at this time, for the distinction which has been mentioned, when the question relates to the structure of the common <em>indebitatus </em>count, for property sold and delivered. For whatever may have been the received meaning formerly of the words goods and merchandise, it is quite certain that at present according to our standard linguistic authorities, the word \u201cgoods\u201d may well include oxen. The language of the law itself affords an example of the use of the words found in this declaration, in a sense broad enough to include cattle. The third section of the statute of frauds, \u2014 \u00a7 <em>8181^ Comp. </em>L.\u2014 provides that \u201c no contract for the sale of any <em>goods, wares or merchandise, </em>for the price of $50 or more, shall be valid, unless,\u201d &amp;c., and the succeeding section provides what shall be a sufficient memorandum in case of a sale of \u201c goods \u201d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>auction. It has always been considered that the phrase \u201cgoods, wares or merchandise\u201d in the third section, and the word \u201cgoods\u201d in the fourth of this statute, embraced animate as well as inanimate property, and no reason is perceived for giving a narrow meaning to the words when used in the common count.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">The goods themselves are not to be recovered in the action or any damages for them. What is sought is to recover damages for nonpayment of the price for which the articles were sold, and hence the goods are said to be quite collateral to the action. The party need not be misled by the general language of the declaration. He can always compel a more specific and detailed statement of the items of the plaintiff's demand, by calling for a bill of particulars.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">The judgment below should be affirmed with costs.</p>\n<judges id=\"b358-7\">The other Justices concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
