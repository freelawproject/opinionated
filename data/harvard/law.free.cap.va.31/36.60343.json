At the time of his.death he owned, among other property, about eight acres of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>land lying onMossey creek in said county, on which he had erected a grist-mill and saw-mill, both of them operated by water from a dam built across the creek, and drawing the water by separate channels. By his will, which was published in January, 1813, he gave one-half of- this property to his son James, and the other half to his wife and small children, of whom there were two, one named Hannah, who afterwards married Abraham Hanna, and the other named John. In September, 1818, James Erwin sold and conveyed to John Landes his half of this property. In January, 1827, John Landes sold and conveyed to Abraham Hanna \u201c one-half of a certain lot of ground, including -one-half of the interest of the saAv-mill, forebav and part of the tail race; also the use and benefit of the Avater for said saAv-mill, AArhen it can be coirveniently spared from the grist-mill so as not to do it any injury\u2014that is, the grist-mill\u2014said lot of ground to be occupied for no other purpose than for saAV-logs and planks.\u201d This <em>gave </em>to Hanna in his OAAm right onelialf and in right of his wife one-sixth of the saAv-mill property. In February, 1835, Landes sold and conveyed to John Envin his half of the mill property, except Avhat. he had conveyed to Hann\u00e1. And in September, 1836, Hanna and wife coirveyed to said ErAA-in the interest of Mrs. Hanna in all the property except the saw-mill property. Mrs. Envin died in 1851, and by her Avill gaAe her interest in the A\\diole property, mill and saAv-mill, to John Erwin ; so that John Envin then oAA\u2019ned the AA'hole of the grist-mill property, and two-sixtlis of the saw-mill; and Hanna and Avife oAvned the other four-sixth in the saw-mill property.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b61-4\">\"When EdAvard Envin died there was one pair of burrs and one pair of choppers in the mill, and this continued until the purchase by John Envin from Landes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>and Iianna and wife. He then put in another pair of burrs, and probably added other improvements. But although it had always been the ease that the mill was understood to have the preference to the water when there was not enough for both, no difficulty seems to have occured between the owners of the mill and saw-mill in relation to it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b62-10\">By deed bearing date January, 1851, John Erwin and wife conveyed to James T. Clarke, Anthony Miller and Jefferson Miller \u201c all their right, title and interest, both present and prospective, to and in a certain merchant-mill property and saw-mill property situated upon Mossey creek, in the county of Augusta, bounded as follows, viz :\u201d setting out the boundaries, \u201c containing eight acres, more or less, with all and singular the appurtenances thereto belonging or in anywise appertaining to said interest conveyed in the above premises.\u201d And they set out the interest conveyed as five-sixths of the mill property, the other sixth on the death of Mrs. Erwin ; and one-sixth of the sawmill property and another sixth on Mrs. Erwin's death, and in the meantime they were to hold this interest without rent. \u201c The water right conveyed with the said merchant-mill property to be not less than the quantity of water which a chute five feet two inches by three and a half inches under a three feet head of water or the equivalant, would discharge\u2014the preference to the above extent over other right, in point of water,\"having always been conceded to said merchant-mill property, both before and since the death of the testator, from whom the rights were derived.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b62-11\">The vendees, Clarke, Miller and Hall, purchased this, property for the purpose of establishing a paper-mill, and soon after their purchase they proceeded to convert the mill into a paper-mill. In doing this they changed the large waterwheels which propelled the machinery <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>of the mill, which had been breast wheels, into overshot wheels, which required the water to he taken from the dam at a higher level, and which were more readily affected by the lowering of the Avater in the pond; and very soon a controversy arose betAveen those parties and Hanna, Avho was operating the saAv-mill. In August, 1851, they filed their bill in the circuit court of Augusta county, in aaTl\u00edcIi they set out their right to the Avater as granted by Envin and Avife, and alleged that this preference of the mill to the Avater had always been recognized, and Avas recognized in the deed from Landes to Hanna; and that said Hanna was so using the AArater at his saw-mill as to interfere most materially with the Avork of their paper-mill, and inflicting upon them irreparable damage. And they prayed' that he might be enjoined from using the Avater from said dam in such .way as to stop or obstruct their machinery. And as some of the purchase money had not been paid, they prayed that Envin might be restrained from collecting it until he can clearly establish plaintiff\u2019s right under his deed to the use of the water as provided.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b63-6\">Hanna answered the bill at much length. He denied that there eAer had been a usage giving preference to the water to the grist-mill to the extent ErAvin had undertaken to commy to the plaintiffs. He says that the parties being interested in both mills, it Avas usual in seasons of extreme drought, and when Avater Avas scarce, and both mills could not run at the same time, to give preference to the grist-mill. These occasions, however, Avere A'ery rare, the supply of Avater being sufficient at almost all seasons for both mills. Under these circumstances and with this understanding respondent accepted the deed from Landes. He insists that the provision in that deed was intended to express nothing more than that, for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>benefit of the grist-mill, a sufficient supply of water to keep it running, as it then was, should be yielded to it; so that the grist-mill might not be injured in the business it was then- doing. He says that since the Jear 1827 and down to the obtaining the injunction *U SU^\u2019 ^ie ^aS euj\u00b0.Ye&lt;^ the uninterrupted use of such a supply of water from the dam, which supplied both the grist and saw-mill, as to keep his saw-mill constantly at work, except at rare and remote intervals of time, when extreme drought had so reduced the flow of water, as that it became necessary for a short time to suspend sawing, in order that a head of water might bo accumulated. He insists that the paper-mill requires much more water than was required by the merchant-mill under any of the arrangements of wheels and machinery that has existed since 1829. And he insists that the water right granted by John Erwin to the plaintiff, to use as much water as a chute five feet two inches wide and throe and a half inches deep under a head of three feet, is a direct infringement of the rights of respondent; that such a chute will discharge more water than ordinarily flovrs in the stream. And he asks that commissioners may be appointed to fix and establish a- permanent water mark to regulate the rights of the parties.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b64-6\">A great many depositions were taken by both parties, and of course their views and opinions were conflicting. The cause came on to be heard on the 7th of July, 1856, when the court perpetuated the injunction as to Hanna, with costs; but dissolved it as to Erwin, and dismissed the bill as to him. But the decree was to be without prejudice to the right of Hanna to sue at law, &amp;e. And thereupon Ilanna applied to this court for an appeal.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b64-7\"><em>Hugh W.

The court is of opinion that the relative rights of the respective proprietors of the grist-mill and saw-mill, in the proceedings mentioned, t,o the waterpower capable of'being derived from the dam on which the said mills were dependent for their operation, continued to be the same after the execution of the deed of the 2d day of January, 1851, from John Erwin and wife to Clarke, Miller and Hall, in the proceedings mentioned, as they were at the time of the execution of that deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-9\">\u2022 2. The court is further of opinion that the said right of the proprietors of the grist-mill were prior and paramount to the said right of the proprietors of the saw-mill; so that whenever and while there was not more than water-power enough for the operation of the grist-mill, the proprietors of the saw-mill had no right to use the water-power so as to obstruct or affect the operation of the grist-mill.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-10\">3. The court is further of opinion that the proprietors of the grist-mill had a right, after they acquired the same, to convert it into a paper-mill, and were entitled to the same priority over the proprietors of the saw-mill in the use of the water-power for the operation of the paper-mill to which they were previously entitled in the use of the water-power for the operation of the grist-mill; but were so entitled only to the same extent to which they were so previously entitled to the use of the water-power.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-11\">4. The court is further of opinion that the controversy in this case was a proper subject of equitable jurisdiction; and the circuit court, therefore, instead <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>of rendering the decree which it did, thus turning the parties out of a court of equity, in which their controversy was pending and might have been settled in a single suit, and leaving them to their remedy at law, where a multiplicity of suits would have been necessary, ought to have proceeded, according to the prayer of the bill, to \u201c ascertain, define and settle the rights of all parties to the use of the said water, and grant such other and further relief as is suited to equity and the nature of the case, &amp;c.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b66-10\">5. The court is, therefore, further of opinion that the said decree of the circuit court is erroneous; and it is decreed and ordered that the same be reversed and annulled, and that the appellant recover against the appellees his costs by him expended in the prosecution of his appeal aforesaid here. And it is further decreed and ordered that the cause be. remanded to the said circuit court for further proceedings to be had therein in conformity with the foregoing opinion and decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-11\">\"Which is ordered to be certified to the said circuit court of Augusta county.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-12\">Decree reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
