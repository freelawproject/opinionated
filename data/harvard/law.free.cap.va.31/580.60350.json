Brockenbrough, executrix of Littleton Brockenbrough, deceased, and Ferdinand Shackleford, administrator of Thomas B. Shackleford, deceased, judgment creditors of John M. Brockenbrough, to set aside as fraudulent three deeds of trust made by the said John M. Brockenbrough. The creditors secured, as well as John M. Brockenbrough, answered denying the fraud.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b605-9\">The first of these deeds bears date the 26th of October, 1870, and by it John M. Brockenbrough and Austina, his wife, for the purpose of securing the payment of four notes therein described, due to I. M. Parr, of Baltimore, conveyed to Thomas Croxton a tract of land called The Island, and personal property, &amp;c. This deed' and its provisions are fully set out in .the opinion of <em>Burks, </em>J. It appeared very clearly from the evidence that Parr lent to Brockenbrough $10,000 at twelve <em>per cent, </em>interest, and the notes mentioned in the deed were given for that loan; and certainly as to him and the trustee, Croxton, there was no fraudulent intent; and as to Brockenbrough, there was no evidence of fraud unless it was to be inferred from the provisions of this.and subsequent deeds.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b605-10\">The second deed bore date the 28th of February, 1878, and by it John M. Brockenbrough conveyed to T. B. B. Wright a farm called The Cottage, contain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>ing two hundred and eighty-four acres-, in trust to^eure to Lucy C.

And the said Brockenbrough reserved to himself the right to and use of said property until the 1st of January, 1877, unless he, th\u00e9 said Brockenbrough, shall consent to. a sale at an earlier day; and upon the further trust that the said Wright, with the consent of the said Brockenbrough, shall sell at any time; but after the 1st of January, 1877, if payment is demanded by said creditors, upon the terms and in -the manner prescribed by \u00a7.6, eh. 117, Code of Virginia, in all respects, except that it shall not bo for cash, but upon such terms as are provided for in the act of the general assembly entitled an act to regulate judicial sales and prevent a sacrifice of property, approved July 11th, 1870. And upon the further trust that the said Wright, with the consent and under the direction of said Brockenbrough, shall at any time sell the said tract of land in part or in whole, as said Brockenbrough might deem most expedient, and also cut and sell any wood and timber, and appropriate the proceeds of the same, as well as the rents and profits, to the payment of the debts secured. And it is expressly covenanted and agreed by the said Brockenbrough that he reserves to himself and family all exemptions and property allowed by the constitution of Virginia and all laws passed in pursuance thereof, and in addition thereto all exemptions allowed under the bankrupt law. This deed was admitted to record on the 6th of March, 1873.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b606-6\">By deed of the same date as the last named, the said John M. Brockenbrough, reciting that his wife, Austina, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>had united with him to convey all her right and interest in certain lands mentioned, devised to her by her father, and also in conveying her contingent right of dower in The Island, and that it was agreed between them that in lieu thereof he should settle upon her for her benefit certain other property of adequate value and amount; and whereas her brother, Austin Brockenbrough, did by his will give to said Austina personal property to the amount of $0,000, which, with interest, now amounts to $8,000, to be made over to her by her husband by deed, which said sum has been received by the said John M. Brockenbrough; he, in consideration of the premises, and the further consideration of the natural love and affection which the said John M. Brockenbrough has for his wife, conveys to T. R. B. Wright his farm called The Cottage, after the payment of the debts due Lucy C. Brockenbrough and F. Settle; also his interest in The Island, subject to the payment of the debt to Parr, with all crops, horses, &amp;c., &amp;c., in trust for the use and benefit of himself and wife, and in no way subject to his debts, during their joint lives and the life of the survivor, and then to their children.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b607-4\">It appears that the plaintiff, Lucy C. Brockenbrough, had brought a suit on the bond held by her against John M. Brockenbrough, and that at the March term of the county court, which commenced on the third day of the month, she recovered a judgment against him. And she refused to accept the deed executed for her security.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b607-5\">It appears further that Settle had not instituted an action on the bond due to him, but on the first day of the March term of the court Brockenbrough went into court and confessed a judgment for the amount of the bond without any process having been issued against him. And upon this ground the plaintiffs in their bill contested the validity of his judgment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b608-11\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>It appears further that the tract called The Island was devised by Moore E. Brockenbrough to his five sons; \u2022 that under a decree for partition of the land, in 1853, the \u2022 commissioners allotted the whole tract to B. W. Brockenbrough, who agreed to take the same at the valuation put upon it, and he conveyed it to Bichard H. Harwood and others in trust to secure the several parties interested in the property their proportions of the purchase-money. One of those parties was Jno. M. Brockenbrough, and another was Littleton Brockenbrough, the testator of the plaintiff, Lucy O. Their shares were each $5,595.18f-. Another share of the same amount was due to Edward Brockenbrough, who seems to have died previous to the year 1870.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b608-14\">By deed dated the 30th of August, 1870, B. W. Brockenbrough, in consideration of the payment of all debts due by him to Edward Brockenbrough, deceased, as well as the payment by J. M. Brockenbrough of the liabilities incurred by the said B. W. Brockenbrough on account of The Island property, the release of all demands held by the said L M. against the said B. W. Brockenbrough in any way, and of the further consideration of $3,250 paid to the said B. W. by the said J. M. Brockenbrough, conveyed to the said J. M. Brockenbrough the tract of land called The Island, with all the personal property thereon, and his, the said B. W. Brocke.nbrough\u2019s, interest in the estate of Edward Brockenbrough, deceased.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b608-15\">In the progress \u2022 of the cause the court directed a commissioner to ascertain and report what moneys are still unpaid and due by B. W. Brockenbrough as purchaser of the farm called The Island, and to whom the said moneys are due, and also what liens, whether by deeds of trust or otherwise, there are upon the realty and personalty mentioned in the complainant\u2019s bill, and any other matter deemed pertinent by him, or .that he may be requested to report specially by any party in interest.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b609-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>In pursuance of this decree the commissioner made a report of the debts of \u00abT. M. Brockenbrough which were liens, and their priorities. The first is a judgment recovered by Thomas Shackleford on the 8th of April, 1867, for $300 of principal, interest and costs $154.15. The second is the four notes due I. M. Parr, secured by deed to Croxton, amounting to $13,240. He states the judgment of Settle as of March 3d, 1873, the first day of the court, and that of Mrs. Lucy O. Brockenbrough as of the 5th of March, the last day of the term, when the office judgment was confirmed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b609-4\">The amount due hy B. W. Brockenbrough on the purchase of The Island farm, and secured by deed of trust to Harwood and others, principal and interest $11,860.88 to Edward Brockenbrough, and to \u00a5m. E. Brockenbrough a balance of $286.17. John M. Brockenbrough was the administrator of Edward Brockenbrough, and the estate was debtor to him on his administration account $1,048.03, and the other outstanding debts of Edward, not paid, were $475.76. The commissioner also makes what he calls an approximate estimate of division of the estate of Edward Brockenbrough, and after deducting the outstanding debts, including the amount due the administrator and the expenses of collecting the fund, he makes \u2022 the amount for division $10,030.88, one-sixth of which, $1,671.81, wTas due to B. W. Brockenbrough, \"W. W. Brockenbrough, John H. Brockenbrough, Robert Knox and wife, and W. R. Aylett and wife, and one-sixth was due to the three children of Littleton Brockenbrough, each the sum of $557.27.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b609-5\">\"While the cause was pending in \u2019the court, and after the commissioner had settled the accounts as before stated, the plaintiffs filed a supplemental bill, in which, after referring to these accounts,- they charge that since the filing of their bill the debt to Parr, secured by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>deed to Croxton, had been paid off and satisfied by John M. Brockenbrough, and that he has been discharged of the same by the said Parr, and the notes specified in said deed of trust have been surrendered to said Brockenbrough, but that Croxton has not executed to Brockenbrough a deed of release, but still holds the legal title to the property specified in said deed. And making John M. Brockenbrough, Parr, and Croxton parties defendants to the bill, they pray that the property may be sold for the payment of their debts, and for general relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b610-9\">Croxton and Parr answered the supplemental -bill. Croxton denied the allegations of the bill that the notes due to I. M. Parr and secured by the deed of trust had been satisfied by J. M. Brockenbrough. Respondent had advertised for sale The Island and other property to satisfy said notes, and the sale was enjoined. In this state of matters Brockenbrough made and executed a deed of quit-claim to The Island and certain personal property mentioned in said deed of quit-claim, and put said Parr in possession of the same until the court shall have settled the question of the validity of various claims sought to be enforced against said property, some of which existed by virtue of a deed of trust made by B. <em>\"W. </em>Brockenbrough many years before the deed to respondent was made. The sole interest of J. M. Brockenbrough was his equity of redemption and possession, the value of the first to him. being nothing; no sale could be made on account of the interdict of the court, and when that should be removed this respondent, as well as Parr, knew that liens to the amount of from five to six thousand dollars at least existed ahead of his claim for the notes due said Parr; the possession of the land was valueless to Brockenbrough because of his inability to cultivate it, and hence he was anxious for a sale; but as he could not sell he made the deed and quit-claim to his largest creditor. He avers that no sale of The Island <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>and other property has ever been made, nor has respondent ever heard of any arrangement to make a deed of release or surrender of the notes secured in the trust to him; certain it is that nothing of the sort has been done.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b611-4\">Parr denied that Brockenbrough had paid the notes given him by Brockenbrough aud secured by the deed of trust. Up to October 13,1874, Brockenbrough had paid him $792.38, arising from sales made from The Island, as he understood, and that was all.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b611-5\">The deed from J.

Brockenbrough to Parr bears date the 16th of November, 1874, and in consideration of the sum of five dollars Brockenbrough doth grant, sell, convey and forever quit claim unto the said Parr all his right, title and interest in the farm called The Island, with the following personal property, specifying it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b611-6\">Several witnesses were examined as to what had been said by Brockenbrough and Croxton in relation to this transaction. It is sufficiently referred to by Judge <em>Burks </em>in his opinion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b611-7\">The cause came on to be heard on the 25th of November, 1875, when the court held that the deed of trust made by J. M. Brockenbrough and wife to T. Croxton for the benefit of I. M. Parr was good against all creditors seeking to establish liens upon the farm called The Island, except those named in the commissioner\u2019s report secured in the deed of trust made by B. W. Brockenbrough to Harwood and others; and it appearing from receipts filed that W. B. Brockenbrough, \"Wb B. Aylett and wife, the heirs of Littleton Brockenbrough, and Knox and wife have been paid the sums reported due them in said report, and it being the opinion of the court that the claims reported as due J. M. and B. \"W. Brockenbrough passed under the deed to Croxton; and it further appearing that J. M. Brockenbrough has since the death of his wife made to I. M. Parr a deed granting all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>his interest in said Island farm, the injunction awarded in the case of <em>Shackleford </em>v. <em>Croxton, &amp;c., </em>is dissolved.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AW3\">The court was further of opinion that the personal property, of J. M. Brockenbrough, not in existence on The Island farm at the date of the deed to Croxton, embraced in the deed to I. M. Parr .of November, 1874, except such as was substituted or exchanged for that then on said farm, is liable to the existing lien of B. W. Brockenbrough; and it was ordered that one of the commissioners of the court should ascertain and report what personal property passed under the deed from J. M. Brockenbrough to Parr, of November, 1874, not embraced in said deed to Croxton, or substituted or exchanged therefor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b612-10\">The deed to T: R. B. Wright having created interests iu The Island farm which could not and did not pass under the deed from J. M. Brockenbrough to I. M. Parr, it is ordered that said Croxton, trustee, proceed, as directed by the deed from Brockenbrough and wife to him, to sell said land and report his proceedings to the court. And the court further orders that I. M. Parr surrender to J. M. Brockenbrough the notes taken and secured in the deed to Croxton, trustee. And the trustee, Wright, was directed to proceed to sell The Cottage farm, embraced in the deed of trust to him, and report to the court.

Broekenbrough.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-4\">The deed bears date the 26th day of October, 1870, and after reciting that the grantor is indebted to I. M. Parr, of Baltimore, Maryland, by four promissory notes, all of the same date with the deed, for the following sums, and payable as follows, to-wit: one note for $3,200, due November the 1st, 1871; another for $2,960, due November the 1st, 1872; another for $3,720, due November the 1st, 1873; and the last for $3,360, due November the 1st, 1874, purports to convey to the trustee a tract of land called \u201cThe Island,\u201d lying on the Rappahannock river, with all the buildings, improvements, crops then upon or thereafter grown upon- the said land, until the said notes are fully paid, all stock of horses, mules, cattle, sheep and hogs, with the increase of the same then on the said land, or thereafter placed on the same, and all farming implements used in the cultivation of the land, in trust to secure the payment of the notes aforesaid to the said Parr, as they respectively become due and payable. In default of the payment of any one of the said notes at maturity, the trustee, on request by the said Parr, is empowered and required, after advertising, to proceed to sell the property conveyed, for cash, to an extent sufficient to pay all the costs and charges attending the execution of the trust, including the usual commissions, and whatever sum may be then due to the said Parr on any or all of said notes that may have matured, and upon such credit for the residue as will raise the sum or sums necessary to satisfy any of said notes which may not have matured at the time of the sale; and after fully satisfying the said notes with all interest and the costs, &amp;c., aforesaid, the trustee is required to pay the balance arising from the sale to the grantor. No schedule or inventory of the property conveyed was annexed to the deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>It is contended, in the first place, by the learned counsel for the appellants, that this deed is fraudulent on its face. There is no doubt that the provisions of a mortgage or deed of trust may be of such a character as of themselves to furnish evidence sufficient to justify the inference of a fraudulent intent. Such is the case where the grantor reserves a power over the property conveyed incompatible with the avowed purposes of the trust and adequate to the defeat thereof. This principle was enunciated in <em>Lang </em>v. <em>Lee &amp; </em>others, 3 Rand. 410, and has been repeatedly recognized by this court in subsequent decisions. <em>Sheppards </em>v. <em>Turpin, </em>3 Gratt. 357, 373, 397, 398, <em>et seq.; Spence </em>v. <em>Bagwell, </em>6 Gratt. 444; <em>Addington </em>v. <em>Etheridge, </em>12 Gratt. 436; <em>Quarles &amp; others </em>v. <em>Kerr, </em>14, Gratt. 48; <em>Perry &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Shenandoah Nat. Bank &amp; others, </em>27 Gratt. 755.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-9\">While, however, the principle referred to is established by these decisions, it is equally well settled, in this state at least, that no irresistible inference of intent to defraud is deducible from a provision in a deed of trust postponing a sale of the property conveyed for a reasonable length of time and reserving the use of the property to the grantor until sale, even although a portion of the property conveyed may be perishable in its nature and consumable in the use; nor is such inference a necessary deduction from the omission to annex a schedule or inventory of the property to the deed; nor is the inference a necessary one where ail these circumstances exist in the same case. <em>Lewis </em>&amp; <em>others </em>v. <em>Caperton's ex'or &amp; others, </em>8 Gratt. 148; <em>Cochran </em>v. <em>Paris, </em>11 Gratt. 348; <em>Dance &amp; others </em>v. <em>Seaman &amp; others, </em>Id. 778; <em>Sipe </em>v. <em>Earman &amp; others, </em>26 Gratt. 563.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-10\">I do not mean to say that these circumstances, apparent by the deed, when taken in connection with extrinsic evidence, are not entitled to weight in determining the question of intent. I think they are so entitled; but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>alone they are not sufficient to establish fraud. They are consistent with an honest purpose.- The presumption of law is in favor of honesty, and \u201cthe court cannot-presume fraud unless the terms of .the instrument preclude any other infe<em>rence.\" Allen, </em>J., in <em>Dance &amp; others v. Seaman others, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"A4qg\">Recurring to the deed in question, I find nothing in it particularly distinguishing it from other deeds held by this court to be valid, except the provision conveying or purporting to convey the crops <em>to be grown </em>on the land until the secured notes are fully paid, and the further provision purporting to convey horses, mules, cattle, &amp;c., <em>which might be thereafter placed on the land.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b615-9\">It is contended that these provisions are indicative of fraud; that while the professed object was to secure the debt to Parr, the real design was, while securing Parr, to shield the property from other creditors and secure the control and use of it to the grantor; and thus that the whole deed was vitiated and rendered void as to such creditors.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-10\">This would seem to be a harsh inference. If, as was thought b}- the judge below, the deed was inoperative to bind the future crops and the stock which might thereafter be placed on the land, a futile effort to convey under a mistaken view of the grantor\u2019s right would not he a sufficient ground for the charge of fraud. A man may well mistake the law in such a case and he innocent. Ror, in this view, would the creditors be injured. They might, by legal proceedings, subject the crops and the after-acquired stock to their debts if they chose to do so. If, on the other hand, these provisions were effectual to pass the title at law to the crops and stock, or to bind the same in equity, I do not perceive how fraud can be justly predicated of them. It would seem that the scheme of the deed ivas, that until default in the payment of the sums secured, the crops made on the farm, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>as well as any stock of the description mentioned which nbght be placed thereon, should constitute a part of the subject. Ho benefit is reserved to the grantor. should such an arrangement be regarded as fraud-u^ent ? To my mind, it is rather indicative of an honest purpose in the grantor to dedicate not only what he had, but also what he might make or acquire, to the payment 0f pjg debts.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-12\">It is a maxim of the common law that a man cannot grant a thing which he has <em>not\u2014nemo dat quod non habet. </em>To constitute a valid sale at law the vendor must have a present property, either actual or potential, in the thing sold. <em>Smithhurst </em>v. <em>Edmunds, </em>1 McCarter (14 N. J. Chy. Rep.) 409. It is said \u201c that things have a potential existence which are the natural product or the expected increase of something already belonging to the vendor.\u201d 9 Bush. (Ky.) 319. Hence, trees, grass, and corn growing and standing on the ground, fruit upon the trees, and wool upon the sheep\u2019s back may be mortgaged. The legal title passes. <em>Idem. </em>There is conflict tin the authorities as to whether unplanted or future <em>crops\u2014fructus in</em>dustriales\u2014can be conveyed so as to pass the title at law. It was held in a recent case in the supreme court of New York that while at law a mortgage or sale of future acquired personal property, the mortgagor neither having acquired the thing nor the agent of its production at the time of making the contract, creates no valid subsisting property, yet if the future-acquired property be the product of present property in the mortgagor, as the wool growing on a flock of sheep, or the produce of a dairy, or of a farm, or anything of that character, the mortgage will take effect upon the property as soon as it comes into existence, and will be perfectly binding at law. <em>Corderman </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>41 Barb. 404.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-13\">In <em>Beale </em>v. <em>White, </em>94 U. S. R. (4 Otto) 382, it is said that the law will permit the grant or conveyance to take <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>effect upon the property when it is brought in to existence and belongs to the grantor, in fulfilment of an express agreement, if founded on a good consideration, and it appears that no rule of law is infringed and the rights of third parties are not prejudiced; but it is there admitted that decided cases may be found (and some of them are cited) in which the rule,.as stated, is greatly qualified, and others where it is expressly denied if applied in the ordinary business transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-4\">There are cases to the effect that while a mortgage of unplanted crops does not operate to pass the legal title, yet in equity a lien attaches as soon as they are produced, which will be enforced. See <em>Butt </em>v. <em>Ellet, </em>19 Wall. 544; <em>Sillers &amp; wife </em>v. <em>Lester others, </em>48 Miss. 513; <em>Cayee, trustee, </em>v. <em>Stovall, </em>50 Miss. R. 396; <em>White </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>52 Miss. 49; <em>Euurman &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Robb, </em>52 Miss. 653.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">Upon the general doctrine in equity as to liens or charges upon after-acquired property, Mr. Justice <em>Story </em>in <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Winslow, </em>2 Story, 630, after an examination of the authorities, says: \u201c It seems to me a clear result of all the authorities' that wherever the parties, by their contract, intend to create a positive lien or charge, either upon real or upon personal property, whether then owned by the assignor or contractor or not, or if personal property, whether it is then in <em>esse </em>or not, it attaches in equity as a lien or charge upon the particular property as soon as the assignor or contractor acquires a title thereto against the latter, and all persons asserting a claim thereto under him, either voluntarily, or with notice, or in bankruptcy.\u201d And this would seem to be the doctrine on which <em>Holroyd </em>v. <em>Marshall, </em>9 Jur. M. S. 213, was decided by the House of Lords in 1863.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">Rumerous cases upon the general subject are referred to in 2 Wrait\u2019s Actions and Defences, 170, <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b618-11\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>. I have referred to these decisions to show the somewhat uncertain state of the law on the subject of the transfer of titles to and the creation of charges upon fu- . ture crops and after-acquired property generally; and as I do not deem it absolutely essential in this case to determine what is the rule on the subject, I desire to be understood as expressing no opinion upon it. The crops raised on the land after the deed was made have all been consumed, except a portion conveyed to Parr by the deed of November the 16th, 1874. The judge below decided that these crops remaining are subject to the lien of the execution of 13. W. Brockenbrough. This decision is adverse to the appellees, and they are not complaining. And so as to the property, if any remains, which may have been acquired by substitution or exchange for property specifically conveyed in the deed. The decree appealed from seems to determine the right to this property in favor of Parr\u2019s trustee. The only party who could complain of this is the execution creditor, and he has not appealed and is making no objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-12\">Looking to the evidence in the case, I find nothing indicating a fraudulent purpose on the part of any concerned in the transaction which is the subject of investigation. The debt secured was for money lent in good faith. No one can doubt that. It is admitted by the counsel for the appellants. The grantor in the deed was more or less embarrassed with debt when he made the deed, but was the owner of a <em>large </em>and valuabte estate, and there is no reason to doubt the truth of what he alleges, that he supposed by borrowing the money and getting indulgence on the payment he would be able to discharge all his liabilities. The Island farm was estimated to bo worth at least \u00a720,000, The Cottage farm \u00a78,000 or more, and he had other property besides. I have not made the calculation, but from the report of the commissioner it would seem that his liabilities did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>not exceed the then estimated value of his property. There seems to have been, at the date of the deed,- only one judgment against him, the principal of which was $800. Although The Island was incumbered by the deed of trust made by B. W. Brockenbrough in 1853, The Cottage farm and other property were not incumbered, except by the comparatively small judgment before mentioned. He was left in the possession of the property conveyed to the trustee, Croxton, as contemplated by the deed, and as is usual in mortgages and deeds of trust. The evidence shows that he managed the property badly, that the seasons were unfavorable, that his crops were inferior, and that no profit was realized from the farm. It does not appear that his creditors, at the time the deed was executed, complained of any unfairness in the transaction. Certainly, no suits were brought against him until more than two years had elapsed. I find nothing in the circumstances of the case which cannot be reconciled with good faith in the making of the deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-4\">It is convenient, in this connection, to notice the charge made in argument by the counsel for the appellants, that the debt to Parr is usurious. It might be a sufficient answer to say that the question of usury is not presented by the pleadings. Usury is nowhere charged or insinuated in any of the bills. If the appellants, as creditors, would have been allowed to make such a defence at all for the debtor, which he did not choose to make for himself, the extent of the relief, if usury had been proved, would \u25a0 have been the abatement of the usurious premium. <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Hull, </em>9 Gratt. 8. But it does not appear that the transaction was in fact usurious. The sum borrowed was $10,000. The rate of interest then allowed by law was twelve <em>per centum, per annum. </em>Interest was computed at that rate, averaged for the four years, and included in the notes, the instalments of prin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>cipal-money,it would seem, being $2,000 for each of the first two years and $3,000 for each of the last two. This is apparent from a calculation furnished by the\u2019counsel for the appellees.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b620-9\">The reservations in the deed which was made to Wright (trustee) to secure the debts due to Mrs. Brockenbrough and Settle do not vitiate the deed. The grantor had the right to convey his property subject to the exemptions allowed by law, and such is the effect of the deed. The other objections to this deed need not be noticed, after what has. been said in passing upon the validity of the deed to Croxton.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-10\">The other deed to Wright, settling the property therein mentioned upon the grantor\u2019s wife and children, is, of course, void as to existing creditors, un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>less supported by a valuable consideration. If any consideration therefor moved from the wife, the deed would be upheld to that extent. Such consideration is recited by the deed, but the recitals are not evidence against the creditors. <em>Blow </em>v. <em>Maynard, </em>2 Leigh, 29; <em>William and Miry College </em>v. <em>Powell </em>and <em>others, </em>12 Gratt. 372, 384; <em>Price </em>v. <em>Thrash, </em>30 Gratt. 515. Kb answer to the bill was filed for the wife. In his answer, the husband says that he had gotten by his marriage quite a large amount of money and property, and lie felt that no law would be violated or any injustice done in an effort to secure a bare subsistence to his wife and children out of the remnants of quite a large estate, and that this is all he attempted to accomplish. He does not allege any such agreement for the settlement as is set out in the deed, and there is no proof of any such, nor, indeed, of any valuable consideration for the conveyance. As, however, the decree appealed from does not pass definitely upon the validity of this deed, the rights of the parties under it may be enquired into and adjudicated by the circuit court in the further proceedings to be had in the cause after it shall have been remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-4\">It is further insisted that even if the deed to Croxton (trustee) were valid, the rights of Parr, the <em>cestui que trust, </em>were extinguished by the deed of the 16th of Kovember, 1874. Such would be the ordinary effect at law, on the principle of merger. But, in equity, it is a question of intention. The general rule is, that the mortgagee\u2019s acquisition of the equity of redemption does not merge the legal estate as morgagee so as to prevent his setting up his mortgage to defeat an intermediate title, if such appears to have been the intention of the parties and justice requires it. 1 Jones on Mortgages, \u00a7 380, and authorities cited in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>note (1). In the case of <em>Forbes </em>v. <em>Moffat, </em>18 Ves. R. 384, 890, the master of the rolls, Sir <em>William Grant, </em>\u201c It is very clear that a person becoming entitied to an estate, subject to a charge for his own hen-may\u00bb if be chooses, at once take the estate and keep up the charge. Upon this subject a court of equity is not guided by the rules of law. It will sometimes hold a charge extinguished where it would subsist at law; and sometimes preserve it where at law it would be merged. The question is upon the intention, actual or presumed, of the person in whom the interests are united.\u201d And it is said that even where the parties have undertaken to discharge the mortgage upon the uniting of the estates of the mortgagor and mortgagee in the latter, it will still be upheld as a source of title wherever it is for his interest, by reason of some intervening title or other cause, that it should not be regarded as merged. \u201cThis is based upon the presumption' as matter of law,\u201d says Chief Justice <em>JBelloivs </em>in the recent case of <em>Stantons </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>49 New Hamp. R. 272 (cited in 1 Jones on Mortgages, \u00a7 873), \u201c that the party must have intended to keeji on foot his mortgage title, when it was essential to his security against an intervening title, or for other purposes of security; and it is no matter whether the parties through ignorance of such intervening title, or through inadvertence, actually discharged the mortgage and cancelled the notes and really intended to extinguish them; still on its being made to appear that such intervening title existed, the law would ju\u2019esume conclusively that the mortgagee could not have intended to postpone his mortgage to the subsequent title.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">I think it sufficiently appears from the evidence and \u2022 the circumstances of the ease, that whatever might have been the object and purpose of the deed of November, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>1874, it could never have been intended, and was not expected, that the security of the deed of trust to Parr should be discharged. The consideration for the deed was nominal, and it is incredible that Parr, against his most obvious interest, should have been willing and have designed to surrender his security and let in the intervening claimants, thus defeating the very object he had in view in the pending litigation, to-wit: the preservation of the security which he held. The deed of trust was never actually released, nor the notes surrendered, although it seems to have been the understanding that they should be surrendered. I think the substance of the agreement was, that Parr should hold it subject to the existing incumbrances, including his own, according to their relative priorities, and that if Parr\u2019s debt should not be full}\u2019 satisfied under the deed of trust held by him, he should not look to the grantor for the deficiency and this agreement should be upheld in a court of equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\">As to the judgment of Settle:</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">1. It is contended that it is void, because confessed without a writ being issued. It ivas confessed in open court; the court had jurisdiction of the subject , and the defendant appeared and confessed judgment in proper person. Such a judgment is not void. The prime object of the writ is to notify the defendant of the plaintiff\u2019s action. It was waived by the appearance of the defendant and the confession of judgment. A judgment on confession is equal to a release of errors. Code of 1873, ch. 177, \u00a7 2. Besides, a judgment not void cannot be collaterally assailed because erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-8\">2. It is further contended that if the judgment is not void, the appellant\u2019s judgment has priority as a lien. The latter was a judgment by default in a pending suit, and has relation to the first day of the term of the court in which it was rendered. The judgment of Settle was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>confessed in the same court and on the first day of the same term. Both must be treated as judgments rendered on the same day, at the same time. Neither has precedence over the other in point of time. In such case the court takes no notice of the fractions of a day. <em>Coutts </em>v. <em>Walker, 2 </em>Leigh, 268; <em>Skipwith's ex\u2019or </em>v. <em>Cunningham, </em>8 Leigh, 271, 279, 280; <em>Withers </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>4 Gratt. 407; Freeman on Judgments, \u00a7\u00a7 369, 370. See the provision of the statute, Code of 1873, ch. 182, \u00a7 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-12\">The omission in the decree of any provision for the payment of the debts chargeable on the estate of E. C. Brockenhrough, if error at all, is not an error for which the decree should be reversed. It is not a final decree. These debts may be provided for in the further proceedings to be had in the cause in the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-13\">IJpon the whole case, I am of opinion to affirm the decree of the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-14\">The other judges concurred in the opinion of <em>Burles, </em>J.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-15\">Decree affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b620-11\">Note.\u2014Statement furnished by Appellee\u2019s Counsel:</p>\n<p id=\"b620-12\">Transaction\u2014$10,000 was loaned at 12 per cent, interest, the interest being payable yearly, and the principal being payable in annual instalments\u2014 $2,000 at one year, $2,000 at two years, $3,000 at three years, and $3,000 at four years.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-13\">In accordance with sail agreement, notes were taken as follows, viz:</p>\n<p id=\"b620-14\">1st.
