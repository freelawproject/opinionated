For the reasons that follow, we affirm Correll\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">I. <em>Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">It is well settled that \u201c[o]n appeal, we review the evidence in the light most favorable to the party prevailing below, together with all reasonable inferences that may be drawn.\u201d <em>Benton v. Commonwealth, </em>40 Va.App. 136, 139, 578 S.E.2d 74, 75 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-8\">So viewed, the evidence established that on October 27, 2000, Paxton died, while a patient at Roanoke Memorial Hospital. Paxton was 83 years old. The cause of her death was \u201cpneumonia due to corporeal emaciation and inanition due to chronic starvation.\u201d However, Paxton had suffered from Parkinson\u2019s disease, dementia and hypertension for several years prior to her death.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-9\">On August 3, 2001, a Bedford County Grand Jury indicted Correll for abuse or neglect of Paxton, an incapacitated adult, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-369. During Correll\u2019s three-day trial on the charge, the Commonwealth and Correll presented testimony from a number of witnesses, including medical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>experts, and presented a voluminous amount of medical documentation. A summary of the relevant evidence follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">Correll was appointed as Paxton\u2019s legal guardian in 1997 and was Paxton\u2019s primary caregiver at the time of her death. Correll and Paxton\u2019s other family members began caring for Paxton on a consistent basis in 1991. At that time, Paxton was hospitalized for \u201cbad\u201d weight loss and fluid in her lungs. After a short period in the hospital, Paxton began to gain weight and the fluid in her lungs cleared.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">Paxton was hospitalized again in 1997 for a broken hip. When Paxton was released from the hospital, doctors explained to Correll that she should make sure that Paxton \u201cexercised every day\u201d and was \u201cup and going.\u201d Paxton\u2019s doctors explained that if this was not done, Paxton would suffer from \u201cother complications like pneumonia, bedsores and things of this sort.\u201d Accordingly, Correll hired a home health aide to assist with Paxton\u2019s rehabilitation. She also advised family members who helped with Paxton\u2019s care that they should make sure Paxton ate, make sure she took her pills, and make sure to \u201cmove her and keep her walking\u201d so that Paxton \u201cwouldn\u2019t get sore.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">When visiting Paxton in 1997 and 1998, Carol Gray, Correll\u2019s sister, observed that Paxton appeared to be losing weight again, but \u201cnot drastically.\u201d Paxton\u2019s weight at that time was \u201caround 130, 35 maybe.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Gray asked Correll about Paxton\u2019s continued weight loss and Correll told her Paxton\u2019s doctor had advised \u201c[Paxton] would deteriorate, this was part of the disease or her Parkinson\u2019s disease.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">Paxton was admitted to the hospital again in 1999, for another broken hip. Paxton put on \u201ca little more\u201d weight while she was in the hospital. After Paxton\u2019s hospital stay, Correll arranged for physical therapy for Paxton. Despite her advancing Parkinson\u2019s disease, Paxton healed substantially and \u201cgot up and was walking and everything.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>Gray saw Paxton again during Christmas of 1999 and observed that Paxton had lost more weight. She also heard Paxton say, consistently, that she \u201churt.\u201d When Gray asked Correll about this, Correll explained that Paxton said that \u201call the time, so basically they just, you know, ignored it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">Correll took Paxton to Dr. Adel Salama for a routine medical examination in January of 2000. At that time, Dr. Salama found that Paxton suffered from \u201cadvanced Parkinson-ism, multi infarct dementia, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, osteoarthritis, along with early Stage 2 [bedsores].\u201d Paxton displayed an albumin level of 3.9, indicating that she was not malnourished or undernourished at that time. Dr. Salama prescribed Duoderm patches for Paxton\u2019s bedsores, explained the care procedure for the bedsores to Correll, and advised Correll to keep him updated on Paxton\u2019s condition and to return for Paxton\u2019s regular follow-up examination in July of 2000. Paxton did not return to Dr. Salama in July of 2000 as scheduled.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">In August of 2000, Gray visited Paxton again. Gray observed that Paxton \u201clooked like a skeleton\u201d and that her mental faculties had deteriorated to the point she was not sure Paxton \u201cknew [she] was there.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">Gray testified that when she saw Paxton again on September 9, 2000, during her niece\u2019s wedding, \u201c[She (Gray) ] almost passed out.\u201d Gray said Paxton was in a wheelchair and that Paxton looked so \u201cbad,\u201d she \u201clooked like she should have been laid out in the coffin.\u201d Gray testified that she did not mention this to Correll, but asked Correll\u2019s daughter about it. Correll\u2019s daughter stated that Paxton \u201cate more than her and her dad put together,\u201d but \u201cthis was just her medical condition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b365-8\">Letice Baldwin, Gray\u2019s daughter, also observed Paxton during the wedding on September 9, 2000. Based on Paxton\u2019s appearance, Baldwin \u201cwas surprised [Paxton] was alive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b365-9\">Francis Paxton, Correll\u2019s sister-in-law, testified that Paxton had always had a \u201csmall frame\u201d \u201cfrom the waist up.\u201d However, when she saw Paxton at the September 2000 wedding, she was \u201cshocked\u201d at Paxton\u2019s appearance.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>A few days later, on September 18, 2000, Correll called an ambulance claiming that Paxton \u201chad not eaten for the last day and had gotten dehydrated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">Emergency medical technicians found Paxton sitting in a chair, unresponsive, severely dehydrated, and \u201cpretty close to going into shock.\u201d Paxton required \u201cadvanced life support.\u201d Sherry Weeks, one of the EMTs that responded to Cornell's call, testified that Paxton\u2019s condition was \u201cnot consistent with only being dehydrated for a day.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">When Paxton arrived at the hospital emergency room, she was unresponsive and cachetic, or \u201cextremely emaciated.\u201d \u201cYou could see her ribs\u201d and her \u201cspine bones.\u201d Paxton also had a \u201chealing ulcer on her sternum, mid chest [sic],\u201d an ulcer on her \u201csacral area,\u201d and a \u201csevere\u201d \u201cactive or open ulcer on her right hip.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">Correll told emergency room nurses that Paxton \u201cbegan two days ago with decreased appetite and fluid intake,\u201d and had been \u201closing weight for three weeks.\u201d Dixie Daniel, an emergency room nurse who treated Paxton, testified that her assessment of Paxton indicated that Paxton\u2019s condition would have taken \u201cmore than two days to occur\u201d and that the bedsores found on Paxton would generally take \u201cweeks\u201d to form.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-8\">Another emergency room nurse, Tracey Allison Mann, testified that Paxton\u2019s condition upon arrival at the hospital was \u201cshocking.\u201d Paxton was \u201cmorbidly emaciated,\u201d \u201ccovered with ... bedsores,\u201d and \u201ccontracted at every extremity in a fetal position.\u201d According to Mann, Paxton\u2019s contractures had \u201cbeen in place for some time and were fixed.\u201d Mann testified that although Correll told her Paxton had been ambulatory just two days prior to her admission to the hospital, she believed Paxton had been \u201ccontracted\u201d for greater than one month. Mann opined that Paxton\u2019s most severe bedsores, which displayed \u201cblack, dead tissue,\u201d would have resulted from a \u201cprolonged\u201d period of pressure of a \u201cmonth or greater.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b366-9\">Dr. Salama examined Paxton when she was admitted to the hospital and observed that Paxton appeared clean, but suf<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>fered from \u201c[v]ery severe\u201d \u201cundernutrition,\u201d \u201c[mjoderately severe to severe\u201d dehydration, and \u201c[a]dvanced Stage 3\u201d or \u201cearly Stage 4\u201d bedsores. Because of Paxton\u2019s undernourishment and bedsores, as well as her age and Parkinson\u2019s disease with dementia, Salama thought, \u201cI\u2019m going to lose her.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A-m\">Dr. Salama testified that bedsores are caused by \u201cthree or four factors\u201d: 1) \u201c[t]he patient sitting in one position for a long time\u201d; 2) \u201cmoisture of the skin\u201d; and 3) \u201cfriction.\u201d He stated that Paxton was predisposed to suffer from bedsores, but that with proper care, such sores would not advance \u201cinto Stage 3.\u201d Salama also stated that although Paxton\u2019s albumin had significantly decreased since January of 2000 (indicating undernourishment), albumin has \u201ca long life,\u201d taking 21 days to display a change. However, he testified that refusal to take in fluids for 48 hours would be a sufficient time for Paxton to have displayed such severe dehydration.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">Dr. Salama opined that Paxton\u2019s undernourishment and bedsores were severe:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-6\">But definitely what I\u2019m guessing, that [sic] they developed over days, weeks \u2014 to [sic] weeks, but not hours or not 24. I don\u2019t think I have ever seen Stage 4 or Stage 3 [bedsores] developing over 48 hours.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">He testified that it was not Paxton\u2019s Parkinsonism or atrial fibrillation that brought her to the hospital that day, but it was the bedsores, the undernourishment and the severe dehydration that \u201cposed a significant threat on her life and health.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Al\">Paxton \u201cslow[ly]\u201d responded to treatment during her stay in the hospital. Paxton was discharged to a nursing home on October 3, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">Just prior to Paxton\u2019s discharge to the nursing home, Bedford County Social Services contacted Martha Anderson, a geriatric nurse, and asked her to perform an assessment of Paxton\u2019s condition. Anderson reviewed Paxton\u2019s medical records, performed a \u201cbrief physical assessment\u201d of Paxton and interviewed Correll. Correll advised Anderson that she provided constant care to Paxton, with the help of her two daughters, that Paxton ate \u201cvery well up until last [sic] week <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>or so,\u201d that Paxton was able to ambulate with her walker, and that Paxton sat in a plastic kitchen chair during the day. Correll contended that Paxton \u201cprobably ... got that scrape on her chest from leaning forward and slumping onto the table.\u201d Correll also informed Anderson that she did not know how to use the Duoderm patch Dr. Salama prescribed for Paxton\u2019s bedsores. Anderson noted in her interview notes that Correll didn\u2019t seem to understand the \u201clevel of care\u201d necessary for Paxton\u2019s bedsores.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">Hunter Sisler, Director of Admissions and Social Services at Burrell Nursing Center, asked Correll about Bedford County Social Services\u2019 investigation when she admitted Paxton to the nursing home. Sisler asked Correll what impact the investigation would have on any discharge plan for Paxton. Correll told Sisler that \u201cthe problems with care which evolved into Adult Protective Services being called in were because of the care given by [Correll\u2019s] granddaughter.\u201d Correll stated that \u201cshe herself was going to step in and take over and, therefore, the plan was that she would hopefully get [Paxton] back home under her care.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">Paxton\u2019s condition improved during her stay in the nursing home. Paxton was \u201cinteracting with the staff,\u201d was \u201ceating better,\u201d and her \u201cwounds had begun to heal.\u201d However, Paxton contracted aspirational pneumonia, on or about October 27, 2000, and died from that condition. Dr. Salama testified that such an infection is caused when a person is \u201cnot feeding properly,\u201d vomits, and then suffers from a related infection in the lungs.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">Dr. William Massello, the medical examiner who performed the autopsy on Paxton, testified that he found Paxton to be in a \u201cstate of chronic starvation.\u201d He further stated that, in his experience, individuals suffering from Parkinson\u2019s disease, even in conjunction with dementia, are \u201cvery often well nourished\u201d \u201cwhen they come to autopsy.\u201d He found Paxton\u2019s cause of death to be \u201cpneumonia due to corporeal emaciation and inanition due to chronic starvation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>Dr. Massello agreed that pneumonia is a \u201cnatural foreseeable consequence of starvation.\u201d He stated that in order to display that type of chronic starvation, in general, \u201cin a woman who is 83 years old,\u201d \u201c[i]t would take several weeks\u201d to lose the weight involved. He further stated that he found no condition, upon examination of Paxton, that would have prevented her from consuming food, or any \u201cprior medical problems or conditions\u201d that would have prevented her from \u201cabsorbing and metabolizing the food.\u201d He stated that her condition was not consistent with someone who was eating \u201cthree wholesome meals a day.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">At the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence, Correll presented testimony of several witnesses establishing her devotion to her mother\u2019s constant care. Dr. Donald Nolan, a neurologist who treated Paxton from 1991 to 1998 (\u201con and off\u2019), testified that Paxton \u201calways looked terrible. She was just emaciated.\u201d Dr. John Wenger, who was admitted to testify as an \u201cexpert in family practice,\u201d testified that geriatric patients can suffer from \u201ccachexia,\u201d or starvation/\u201dwasting away,\u201d even though they may be eating on a regular basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">In rebuttal, the Commonwealth presented the testimony of Dr. Rose Jensen, Director of Gerontology at Lynchburg College. After presenting her qualifications, the Commonwealth moved that she be deemed an expert in the \u201carea of gerontology.\u201d Other than questioning what the field of \u201cgerontology\u201d encompassed, and asking whether any \u201cmedical\u201d opinions Jensen would render would come from her background as a nurse, Correll\u2019s counsel raised no objection to her qualification as an expert in the field.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">When the Commonwealth asked Jensen whether Correll\u2019s statement that Paxton \u201chad been eating regularly\u201d was \u201cconsistent or inconsistent with the condition of [Paxton] on admission to the hospital,\u201d Correll\u2019s counsel objected. Correll\u2019s counsel gave the following as the grounds for the objection: \u201cIs she just supposed to read and interpret the evidence?\u201d The trial court responded, in relevant part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>[T]he Supreme Court said that the question can be asked but care must be taken in asking of the question to make sure that the question does not ask the expert to voice an opinion as to or to comment upon credibility of witnesses, weight of the evidence, that kind of thing. Because no witness we know can do that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-5\">But if the expert is just \u2014 and it\u2019s being brought to the expert witness\u2019s attention [sic] matters that are in evidence. And if the expert is merely using those matters to formulate his or her own opinion, you may do that. But of course cannot [sic] comment upon the weight to be accorded any other evidence or credibility of witnesses____So within that context take care in asking the questions, and I think that provides us guidance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-8\">After the Commonwealth rephrased the question, Correll\u2019s counsel again objected, stating \u201cThat\u2019s where my objection comes in, Your Honor.\u201d The trial court ruled that the question \u201ccan be formed in the hypothetical ... so that is not a comment upon the credibility or weight.\u201d The Commonwealth again rephrased the question and Correll\u2019s counsel objected for a third time, stating \u201cI raise my objection, Your Honor.\u201d The trial court ruled, \u201cI\u2019m going to allow that question to be asked.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b370-9\">Nevertheless, the Commonwealth rephrased the question once again and asked \u201cIs the patient\u2019s condition upon admission to the hospital consistent or inconsistent with someone who had been moved frequently, turned, repositioned, and had proper wound care for those wounds?\u201d Dr. Jensen responded, \u201cInconsistent.\u201d The Commonwealth then asked \u201cIs the patient\u2019s condition upon admission to the hospital on September the 18th consistent or inconsistent with someone who has been fed and received proper hydration?\u201d Dr. Jensen responded, \u201cInconsistent.\u201d Correll\u2019s counsel did not object to these newly phrased questions, nor did Correll\u2019s counsel object to Dr. Jensen\u2019s responses to the questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>In closing, Correll\u2019s counsel argued that the evidence presented by the Commonwealth was insufficient to prove any knowing and willful neglect on the part of Correll in caring for her mother. Correll\u2019s counsel contended Paxton\u2019s injuries were merely a result of her terminal illness and advanced age. Specifically, Correll\u2019s counsel stated, \u201cJudge, we\u2019d ask for the Court to dismiss on both charges ... this lady was not killed by my client. And, secondly, that any failing of my client in the care of her mother were [sic] not willful, they were not knowing, and they were not felonious, and they were not criminal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">The trial court subsequently found Correll guilty of neglect, pursuant to Code \u00a7 18.2-869, finding that Correll was the appointed guardian for Paxton, that Paxton was an incapacitated adult, that Paxton suffered from \u201clife-threatening conditions\u201d at the time of her admission to the hospital, and that the conditions resulted from Paxton\u2019s \u201cknowing and willful\u201d failure to provide Paxton with \u201ctreatment, care, goods and services.\u201d In reaching its conclusion, the court specifically considered the fact that Correll had taken care of her mother for several years, that Paxton suffered from a terminal illness, that Paxton was difficult to care for, and that Paxton had been a thin woman. However, based upon the totality of the evidence, the trial court found that the Commonwealth had carried its burden.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">Prior to sentencing Correll, the trial court reaffirmed its findings and its verdict of guilt. The trial court then sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>tenced Correll to serve two years in prison, with one year and eleven months suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">II. <em>Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">On appeal, Correll argues the trial court erred in finding the evidence sufficient to support her conviction. Specifically, Correll contends \u201cthere was no evidence [she] knowingly, willfully or maliciously caused any injuries or failed to provide treatment, care, goods or services\u201d to Paxton as required by Code \u00a7 18.2-369.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In support of her argument, Correll claims the Commonwealth was required to prove the element of \u201cmalice\u201d with regard to the acts in the indictment which allegedly occurred before July 1, 2000, the date upon which the statute was amended by substituting the terms \u201cknowing and willful\u201d in place of \u201cmalicious.\u201d <em>See </em>2000 Va. Acts, ch. 796. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>Correll further claims that the Commonwealth failed to prove her conduct \u201cresulted\u201d in Paxton\u2019s condition. Finally, Correll argues the trial court erred in allowing Dr. Jensen to testify as a \u201cmedical expert,\u201d and in allowing her to testify as to the credibility of Correll\u2019s statement to police, as well as to an \u201cultimate issue in the case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">We find no merit in Correll\u2019s contentions and affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">As stated above, in reviewing a claim of sufficiency of the evidence on appeal, we \u201cconsider the evidence and all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth[,]\u201d the party prevailing below. <em>Derr v. Commonwealth, </em>242 Va. 413, 424, 410 S.E.2d 662, 668 (1991). We must affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment unless \u201cplainly wrong,\u201d <em>Phan v.

Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 299, 308, 494 S.E.2d 484, 488 (1998); Rule 5A:18. The same argument must have been raised, with specificity, at trial before it can be considered on appeal. <em>See Buck v. Commonwealth, </em>247 Va. 449, 452-53, 443 S.E.2d 414, 417 (1994); <em>Floyd v. Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 575, 584, 249 S.E.2d 171, 176 (1978). The purpose of this rule is to insure that the trial court and opposing party are given the opportunity to intelligently address, examine, and resolve issues in the trial court, thus avoiding unnecessary appeals. <em>See Lee v. Lee, </em>12 Va.App. 512, 514, 404 S.E.2d 736, 737 (1991); <em>Kaufman v. Kaufman, </em>12 Va.App. 1200, 1204, 409 S.E.2d 1, 3-4 (1991). Therefore, \u201ca challenge to the sufficiency of the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence is waived if not raised with some specificity in the trial court.\u201d <em>Mounce v. Commonwealth, 4 </em>Va.App. 433, 435, 357 S.E.2d 742, 744 (1987). For these reasons, we do not address the merits of Correll\u2019s newly-coined arguments for the first time on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">Turning next to Correll\u2019s claim that the evidence was insufficient to prove she \u201cknowingly\u201d and \u201cwillfully\u201d caused injury to Paxton or failed to provide her with proper care, as well as her claim that the evidence was insufficient to prove Paxton\u2019s condition \u201cresult[ed]\u201d from her conduct, we find no error in the trial court\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">As Correll correctly points out, the statute reqxiires such neglect or failure to provide \u201ctreatment, care, goods or services\u201d to be \u201cknowing and willful.\u201d The meaning of \u201cwillful,\u201d as it is used in Code \u00a7 18.2-369, appears to be an issue of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>first impression. Nevertheless, we find the meaning of the word in other contexts applies here. <em>See King v. Commonwealth, 2 </em>Va.App. 708, 710, 347 S.E.2d 530, 531 (1986) (\u201cThe validity of using other Code sections as interpretive guides is well established. The Code of Virginia constitutes a single body of law, and other sections can be looked to where the same phraseology is employed.\u201d).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-5\">\u201cWillful\u201d generally means an act done with a bad purpose, without justifiable excuse, or without ground for believing it is lawful. <em>See Richardson v. Commonwealth, </em>21 Va.App. 93, 99, 462 S.E.2d 120, 123 (1995). The term denotes \u201c \u2018an act which is intentional, or knowing, or voluntary, as distinguished from accidental.\u2019\u201d <em>Snead v. Commonwealth, </em>11 Va.App. 643, 646, 400 S.E.2d 806, 807 (1991) (quoting <em>United States v. Murdock, </em>[290 U.S. 389, 394, 54 S.Ct. 223, 78 L.Ed. 381] (1933)). The terms \u201cbad purpose\u201d or \u201cwithout justifiable excuse,\u201d while facially unspecific, necessarily imply knowledge that particular conduct will likely result in injury or illegality. <em>See Murdock, </em>290 U.S. at 395-96, 54 S.Ct. 223.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"An8\"><em>Ellis v. Commonwealth, </em>29 Va.App. 548, 554, 513 S.E.2d 453, 456 (1999). In the absence of direct evidence of intent, such \u201cwillfulness\u201d must be established through circumstances. <em>Lambert v. Commonwealth, </em>6 Va.App. 360, 363, 367 S.E.2d 745, 747 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">Although we have recognized that \u201cwillful maltreatment of a [victim] requires \u2018something worse than good intentions coupled with bad judgment,\u2019 \u201d <em>Ellis, </em>29 Va.App. at 556, 513 S.E.2d at 457 (quoting <em>Mullen v. United States, </em>263 F.2d 275, 276 (D.C.Cir.1958)), we do not find the trial court\u2019s determination of knowing and willful conduct, on this record, to be plainly wrong. Indeed, considering the totality of the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the record clearly reflects that Paxton was severely emaciated and dehydrated when she was admitted to the hospital in September of 2000. The testimony and evidence proved that Paxton\u2019s emaciation was so severe, it would have taken \u201cseveral weeks\u201d to occur. Further, Paxton was covered with \u201csevere\u201d bedsores, several of the type that were so deep as to invade muscle tissue and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>bone. The testimony also proved that the bedsores suffered by Paxton contributed to her life threatening state and that bedsores demonstrating the level of acuteness as those suffered by Paxton would, likewise, take several weeks to develop.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">Dr. Massello testified that, during his autopsy examination of Paxton, he found no condition which would have caused her to be unable to eat, nor which would have caused her body to fail to absorb and/or metabolize food. He also testified that her condition was not consistent with an individual who had been eating \u201cthree wholesome meals a day.\u201d Indeed, no testimony was offered indicating that, <em>at the time of her death, </em>Paxton suffered from any specific condition that would have caused her body to fail to absorb food or water. Nor was there any evidence establishing that Paxton suffered from any condition that would have caused her to spontaneously develop severe, life threatening, bedsores.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">Moreover, several witnesses testified that, at least as of early September, Paxton\u2019s condition and appearance was \u201cshocking.\u201d Although there was no dispute that Paxton was a relatively thin woman and had consistently lost weight during the final few years of her life, the evidence proved that as of the time of her admission to the hospital, family members and friends were very concerned about her condition. Yet, Correll failed to seek medical help for Paxton for some eight months prior to her admission to the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">The evidence in this record, when considered in its totality, demonstrates that Correll was clearly capable of comprehending the seriousness of Paxton\u2019s condition, as well as her need for constant and immediate care. In fact, Correll had cared for Paxton for years prior to her death, and had specifically cared for Paxton in relation to her weight problem and the various bedsores that she had developed over the years. Thus, we simply cannot hold that the trial court\u2019s finding of willful and knowing neglect was plainly wrong. Indeed, testimony given during the trial established that Correll acknowledged Paxton was not being properly cared for prior to her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>admission to the hospital and that those \u201cproblems\u201d were what prompted the investigation by Bedford County Social Services.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">Given the totality of this evidence, including the extreme nature of Paxton\u2019s condition at the time of her admission to the hospital, we find sufficient evidence in the record from which the trial court could find that Correll\u2019s failure to provide Paxton with the appropriate food and/or care, including medical care, amounted to more than bad judgment. Specifically, the evidence supports the trial court\u2019s finding that Correll\u2019s conduct amounted to a voluntary, knowing omission which Correll could not have reasonably believed was lawful or excusable. <em>See Commonwealth v. Hudson, </em>265 Va. 505, 514, 578 S.E.2d 781, 785 (2003) (\u201cWhile no single piece of evidence may be sufficient, the \u2018combined force of many concurrent and related circumstances, each insufficient in itself, may lead a reasonable mind irresistibly to a conclusion.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Derr, </em>242 Va. at 425, 410 S.E.2d at 669)).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">For these same reasons, we conclude that the trial court committed no error in determining that the evidence proved Correll\u2019s conduct, or lack thereof, \u201cresulted\u201d in Paxton\u2019s condition when she presented to the hospital in September of 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">Although Correll accurately points out that circumstantial evidence may establish the elements of a crime, <em>provided it excludes every reasonable hypothesis of innocence, see, e.g., Tucker v. Commonwealth, </em>18 Va.App. 141, 143, 442 S.E.2d 419, 420 (1994), \u201c[t]he statement that circumstantial evidence must exclude every reasonable theory of innocence is simply another way of stating that the Commonwealth has the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Hudson, </em>265 Va. at 513, 578 S.E.2d at 785. This Court must determine \u201cnot whether \u2018there is some evidence to support\u2019 \u201d Correll\u2019s hypothesis of innocence, but, rather, \u201cwhether a reasonable [fact finder], upon consideration of all the evidence, could have rejected [Correll\u2019s] theories ... and found [her] guilty ... beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Whether a hypothesis of innocence is reasonable is a question of fact. <em>See Cantrell v. Common</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number><em>wealth, </em>7 Va.App. 269, 290, 373 S.E.2d 328, 339 (1988). Such factual findings by the trial court are binding on appeal unless plainly wrong. <em>See Glasco v. Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 763, 774, 497 S.E.2d 150, 155 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">Finding no such plain error, w\u00e9 affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">We next address Correll\u2019s contention that the trial court erred in allowing Dr. Jensen to testify as a \u201cmedical expert,\u201d and in allowing her to testify as to the credibility of Correll\u2019s statement to police, as well as to an \u201cultimate issue\u201d in the trial. Once again, on this record, we find that we are precluded from considering these alleged errors because Correll failed to properly preserve them for purposes of appeal. <em>See </em>Rule 5A:18. Indeed, the record reflects that Correll raised no argument below with regard to Dr. Jensen\u2019s qualifications, or her ability to testify as a \u201cmedical expert.\u201d Further, although Correll\u2019s counsel objected to several of the Commonwealth\u2019s questions on the sole grounds that Dr. Jensen should not be allowed to \u201cread and interpret the evidence,\u201d counsel raised no specific argument that the Commonwealth\u2019s questions improperly sought comment on Correll\u2019s credibility. Nor did Correll\u2019s counsel argue that the Commonwealth improperly sought comment on an ultimate issue in the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-8\">Perhaps more importantly, the record demonstrates that Correll\u2019s counsel raised no objection at all to the Commonwealth\u2019s ultimate questions to Dr. Jensen, which the Commonwealth had <em>rephrased, </em>in accordance with the trial court\u2019s rulings on the earlier objections \u2014 rulings that specifically admonished the Commonwealth to refrain from asking Dr. Jensen to comment on Correll\u2019s credibility or the weight of the evidence. Moreover, Correll\u2019s counsel raised no objection to Dr. Jensen\u2019s responses to these questions. Accordingly, we find that we are precluded from considering these issues on appeal because Correll failed to put the trial court on notice of these specific grounds, and ultimately failed to contemporane<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>ously object to the ultimate questions at issue in this appeal. <em>See </em>Rule 5A:18; <em>Clark v. Commonwealth, </em>30 Va.App. 406, 411, 517 S.E.2d 260, 262 (1999) (\u201cAn objection made at trial on one ground does not preserve for appeal a contention on a different ground.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">For the reasons stated in this opinion, we find no error on the part of the trial court and we affirm Correll\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b363-10\">. Correll was also charged with felony murder of Paxton, in violation of Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-33 and 18.2-369.
