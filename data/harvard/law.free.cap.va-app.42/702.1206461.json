Appellant argues the trial court erred in refusing to suppress the evidence discovered on his computer by a hacker, known as \u201cUnknownuser.\u201d Specifically, appellant contends that because Unknownuser had helped secure the arrest and conviction of a child pornographer one year earlier, <em>see United States v. Steiger, </em>318 F.3d 1039 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>538 U.S. 1051, 123 S.Ct. 2120, 155 L.Ed.2d 1095 (2003), Unknownuser was, in fact, a government agent. We disagree, and determine Unknownuser was not a government agent.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We affirm the trial court for the reasons that follow.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-11\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b755-12\">\n<em>Previous E-mail Relationships Between Unknownuser and Police Agents</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b755-13\">On July 16, 2000, Major Kevin Murphy of the Montgomery, Alabama Police Department, received an e-mail from an anon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>ymous sender.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> With a subject line reading \u201cthis is urgent,\u201d Unknownuser told Murphy \u201cI have found a child molester on the net.\u201d Unknownuser included an attachment depicting a man, Steiger, torturing a child; he told Murphy he. knew the man\u2019s name, internet account, home address, and when the molester was on-line. Unknownuser asked Murphy what he could do.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">Murphy contacted the FBI. His police department had a working relationship with Special Agent Margaret Faulkner in the FBI\u2019s Mobile office. From then on, Faulkner acted as a \u201cgo-between\u201d for Murphy and Unknownuser, telling Murphy what to say and how to respond to Unknownuser. Murphy asked Unknownuser to call him in his office. Unknownuser responded by saying he lived in Istanbul, Turkey, \u201c[could] not speak English fluently,\u201d and could not afford an overseas call. Instead, Unknownuser offered to send \u201ceverything by e-mail.\u201d Murphy urged Unknownuser to \u201csend the information you have. We will do everything we can.\u201d Unknownuser e-mailed Steiger\u2019s name, address, fax number, internet account information, and the phone numbers Steiger used to access the internet. Neither Murphy nor Faulkner knew, at first, that Unknownuser was illegally hacking into Steiger\u2019s computer for his information.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">On July 17 and 18, Unknownuser wrote again to Murphy, asking whether Murphy had followed up on the information and asking Murphy to respond. Murphy responded July 19, telling Unknownuser the investigation was continuing and asking Unknownuser to provide him -with Steiger\u2019s \u201cIP address.\u201d Unknownuser provided that information the same day; he also supplied additional information about Steiger in subsequent July e-mails.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-7\">Between July 17 and August 7, 2000, the FBI obtained a search warrant for Steiger\u2019s home and seized his computer. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>However, Steiger\u2019s computer was password encrypted and the FBI needed help in accessing his computer files. Faulkner asked Murphy to request Unknownuser\u2019s assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">Therefore, on August 7, Murphy, in an e-mail with the subject line, \u201cwe need to reach you right away,\u201d asked Unknownuser to get in touch with him. Unknownuser explained he was on vacation and needed his own computer to fulfill Murphy\u2019s request, but that he would be home August 11. In an undated e-mail written between August 9 and 11, Murphy sent another message, \u201cPlease reestablish contact with us. Sorry for the delay, but we have been working on the case. We need for you to assist us in gaining entry into the suspect\u2019s computer. Your assistance will insure the possibility of a conviction on the suspect.\u201d Unknownuser responded August 11, with the subject line, \u201cI am back\u201d and the message, \u201ctell me what you want.\u201d Murphy did not respond. The FBI had received the assistance it needed through other means. Murphy had no more e-mail exchanges with Unknownuser from August 11, 2000 until December 2001, when Unknownuser contacted him about appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">Faulkner, however, maintained her involvement in the Steiger case. She sought the help of the FBI\u2019s Baltimore office to determine Unknownuser\u2019s identity. The Baltimore office found a United States phone number for Unknownuser. Faulkner called the number twice and left two voice mail messages, asking Unknownuser to call the FBI in Alabama.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The FBI determined that Unknownuser\u2019s internet provider was located in Turkey.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-7\">In Turkey, Special Agent James Duffy worked as the FBI\u2019s legal attach\u00e9. In November 2000, Faulkner communicated with Duffy, asking him to help her identify Unknownuser. Faulkner also told Duffy that the United States Attorney had \u201cno interest\u201d in prosecuting Unknownuser should he be persuaded to come to the United States for Steiger\u2019s trial. Duffy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>understood from Faulkner\u2019s request that Unknownuser was a computer hacker; he told Faulkner that Turkish police would be of no assistance since the treaty between the countries<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> did not include computer crimes. However, Duffy attempted to help identify Unknownuser on his own by sending an e-mail to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">Unknownuser called Duffy a few days later. This phone conversation was the only one any of the law enforcement officers ever had with Unknownuser. A man, in Turkish-accented English, identified himself as \u201cUnknownuser\u201d but refused to provide any additional information about himself. Duffy, using questions Faulkner had faxed to him, asked Unknownuser a series of questions about the Steiger matter. He also told Unknownuser that no one was interested in prosecuting him. Unknownuser admitted to Duffy that he had \u201chacked\u201d into Steiger\u2019s computer. Duffy thanked Unknownuser for his assistance with the case, saying that Unknownuser had \u201cpossibly saved\u201d two young girls from further abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">On November 29, 2000, Duffy asked Unknownuser to meet him, while repeating his thanks for the help rendered to that point. Duffy also repeated Faulkner\u2019s assurance that \u201cUS authorities do not desire to prosecute you,\u201d as well as \u201c[y]ou \u25a0will not be arrested \u2014 that is a promise.\u201d Unknownuser responded apologetically, saying he did not want to reveal his identity for safety reasons. He also told Duffy a few things about himself, saying he was a 33-year-old man with a family, and was not \u201ca computer freak.\u201d Unknownuser characterized his search for child abusers and pornographers as \u201ca hobby,\u201d and claimed he had so far \u201ccatched at least 2000 child pornography collectors with my trap.\u201d Finally, Unknownuser revealed how he hacked into people\u2019s computers, describing the computer virus he planted, and pledged to answer \u201cany more questions,\u201d though only through e-mail.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>In his last communication of 2000, Duffy again wrote Unknownuser in a solicitous fashion, responding to Unknownuser\u2019s desire to remain anonymous:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-5\">Thank you for being so honest. Please check your e-mail periodically as I may send you some questions. It will be your option to answer them. If you still have any additional images you captured from his computer that you believe will help this case, you may forward them to me at American Embassy.... Again its your option. Thank you for your help in stopping this man and thank you for your honesty. If you want to bring other information forward, I am available.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">On May 1, 2001, Duffy e-mailed Unknownuser, again seeking help. Duffy told Unknownuser that the Steiger trial was about to start and that he was returning to the United States with the likelihood of testifying. Duffy asked Unknownuser if he had other information for the FBI and provided several contact numbers. Unknownuser responded through e-mail on May 11, telling Duffy he wanted to speak with an American lawyer before deciding. There was no further contact between Unknownuser and law enforcement officials for almost seven months. After Steiger was convicted and sentenced, Duffy e-mailed Unknownuser, telling him the length of Steiger\u2019s sentence, and thanking him profusely for the part he played in the conviction and \u201charsh\u201d sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-7\">\n<em>E-mails Between Unknownuser and Police Agents Regarding Appellant\u2019s Computer Files</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AqS\">On December 3, 2001, Unknownuser wrote Murphy, telling him he had \u201cfound another child molester,\u201d in Richmond, Virginia and that he had \u201ccollected all the evidence and [was] waiting for your reply.\u201d Murphy wrote back the same day; he told Unknownuser that he contacted the FBI and spoke with the \u201csame agent\u201d who \u201chandled the Steiger case.\u201d Murphy reported that \u201cshe\u201d would forward the matter to the Richmond field office. Nonetheless, later on December 3, Murphy wrote to Unknownuser, stating that \u201cthe FBI has asked that you send whatever information regarding this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>criminal complaint to my e-mail address,\u201d and Unknownuser responded by saying he would start sending the information on December 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">On December 4, 2001, Unknownuser e-mailed \u201cparts 1 to 10.\u201d He then sent five additional e-mails asking if Murphy had received all ten parts. In one e-mail, he provided a description of how appellant arranged his computer files and other computer-related information. On December 5 and 6, Murphy told Unknownuser the FBI had received all the information and that the FBI had begun an investigation. On December 13,. 2001, FBI Special Agent Zachary Lowe in Richmond obtained a search warrant for appellant\u2019s home and seized evidence. Appellant was arrested December 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">On December 17, 2001, Unknownuser wrote Duffy, asking for Duffy\u2019s help in determining the status of appellant\u2019s case. Duffy responded, and addressing Unknownuser as \u201c[m]y friend,\u201d thanked Unknownuser for his \u201cvaluable assistance.\u201d Duffy wrote of his intention to retire soon and gave him Faulkner\u2019s e-mail address as Unknownuser\u2019s \u201cpoint of contact from now on.\u201d He described Faulkner as \u201cthe person who the Montgomery Police contact after you send them e-mails.\u201d Duffy closed his note by writing, \u201cplease contact Margaret [Faulkner] with any additional information about violation of our laws.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b760-7\">Faulkner began writing Unknownuser on December 19, 2001. She thanked him for his \u201cconcern and willingness to forward these type eases to us\u201d and wrote she would \u201cbe glad to be the contact point for you if you have further questions or concerns about matters such as the ones you recently sent to us via the Montgomery Police Department.\u201d Faulkner also wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-8\">I can not [sic] ask you to search out cases such as the ones you have sent to us. That would make you an agent of the Federal Government and make how you obtain your information illegal and we could not use it against the men in the pictures you send. But if you should happen across such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>pictures as the ones you have sent to us and wish us to look into the matter, please feel free to send them to us.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">From December 19, 2001 through February 8, 2002, Faulkner and Unknownuser continued what Faulkner described in one of her messages as her \u201cfirst e mail pen pal\u201d relationship. They exchanged both personal and professional information.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On February 6, 2002, Faulkner made the only mention of appellant, telling Unknownuser a suppression hearing was scheduled for a hearing the next month, that she had to testify as to how Unknownuser contacted the police agents, and that \u201c[you] are becoming famous.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">Appellant entered a conditional guilty plea to the charges against him, subject to his motions<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> to suppress the computer evidence. The trial court denied the motions and entered a final order on December 31, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-7\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"AXg\">\n<em>Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b761-8\">Upon appellate review of a trial court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress, the appellant has the burden to show that the ruling, when the evidence is viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, was reversible error. <em>Murphy v. Commonwealth, </em>264 Va. 568, 573, 570 S.E.2d 836, 838 (2002). \u201cA defendant\u2019s claim that evidence was seized in violation of the Fourth Amendment presents a mixed question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>of law and fact that we review <em>de novo </em>on appeal.\u201d <em>Ornelas v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 690, 691, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 1659, 134 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996). \u201cIn making such a determination, we give deference to the factual findings of the trial court and independently determine whether the manner in which the evidence was obtained meets the requirements of the Fourth Amendment.\u201d <em>Murphy, </em>264 Va. at 573, 570 S.E.2d at 838. Here, the trial court accepted the facts as found by the federal trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">The Fourth Amendment does not apply to a private citizen\u2019s search unless that person \u201cis acting as an agent of the Government or with the participation or knowledge of any government official.\u201d <em>United States v. Ellyson, </em>326 F.3d 522, 527 (4th Cir.2003) (a private search may be converted into state action only if the private sector is \u201cregarded as having acted as an \u2018instrument\u2019 or agent of the state\u201d); <em>accord Mills v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 459, 463, 418 S.E.2d 718, 720 (1992). Moreover, a wrongful search and seizure conducted by a private party \u201cdoes not deprive the government of the right to use the evidence that it has acquired lawfully.\u201d <em>Walter v. United States, </em>447 U.S. 649, 656, 100 S.Ct. 2395, 2401, 65 L.Ed.2d 410 (1980) (internal citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">\n<em>Agency</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b762-7\">Appellant bears the burden of establishing that Unknownuser acted as a government agent when he hacked into appellant\u2019s computer and obtained evidence of illegal sexual activities with minors. <em>Ellyson, </em>326 F.3d at 527; <em>Sabo v. Commonwealth, </em>38 Va.App. 63, 73, 561 S.E.2d 761, 766 (2002). Determining whether a person acted privately or as an agent of the government \u201cis a question of fact that must be decided on the circumstances of each case. Resolution of the agency issue \u2018necessarily turns on the degree of the Government\u2019s participation in the private party\u2019s activities.\u2019\u201d <em>Mills, </em>14 Va.App. at 463, 418 S.E.2d at 720 (quoting <em>Skinner v. Railway Labor Executives Ass\u2019n, </em>489 U.S. 602, 614-15, 109 S.Ct. 1402, 1411-12, 103 L.Ed.2d 639 (1989)).</p>\n<p id=\"b763-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>\u201cOf critical importance, for an agency relationship between a private citizen and the government to exist, both parties must have manifested their consent to that relationship, either expressly or by necessary implication from their conduct.\u201d <em>Sabo, </em>38 Va.App. at 74, 561 S.E.2d at 766. \u201cWhile government knowledge of the private person\u2019s conduct obviously is critical, it is not enough, standing alone, to establish the requisite agency.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Therefore, it is not enough that Murphy, Duffy and Faulkner knew that Unknownuser was a computer hacker who had an interest in seeing child abusers and pornographers brought to justice. The evidence must also show that the law enforcement officers and Unknownuser \u201cconsented\u201d to an agency relationship, as manifested in their conduct, in order to establish agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">We have adopted a two-part test to help us determine whether a person was acting as an agent of the government while conducting a search. <em>See Sabo, </em>38 Va.App. at 74, 561 S.E.2d at 766; <em>Mills, </em>14 Va.App. at 463, 418 S.E.2d at 720. \u201cUnder that test, a trial court looks at \u2018(1) whether the government knew of and acquiesced in the search, and (2) whether the search was conducted for the purpose of furthering the private party\u2019s ends.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sabo, </em>38 Va.App. at 74-75, 561 S.E.2d at 766 (quoting <em>Mills, </em>14 Va.App. at 463-64, 418 S.E.2d at 720). However, our inquiry does not stop there; we must also consider \u201cwhether the private party acted at the request of government and whether the government offered a reward.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 75, 561 S.E.2d at 767.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">Our holding in <em>Sabo </em>offers guidance in analyzing this case. In <em>Sabo, </em>someone purposely cut the brakes of a car belonging to the victim, Lawrence, who had an accident as a result. Lawrence subsequently received numerous anonymous calls. Police conducted an investigation to determine who had tampered with her car. One officer, Coale, gave Lawrence a tape recorder and tapes in order for her to tape any calls. Coale told Lawrence not to call the defendant, an ex-boyfriend, but that if he called \u201cand she wanted to make tapes, that would be useful to [their] investigation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 70, 561 S.E.2d at 764. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>Coale thought Lawrence might be able to elicit the defendant\u2019s reaction to the description of her car accident if he were to call. Instead, Lawrence called the defendant and taped their conversation and gave the tape to Coale; it did not elicit any incriminating evidence. <em>Id. </em>Coale advised Lawrence not to contact the defendant any more. <em>Id. </em>However, Lawrence continued phoning and taping the defendant, taping over and reusing tapes of previous conversations.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">We found that the facts in <em>Sabo </em>satisfied neither prong of the two-part test. First, we determined that Lawrence did not continue the taping for law-enforcement purposes, but for her own purposes, concluding that Lawrence\u2019s actions revealed her desire to determine who was \u201cterrorizing her.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 76, 561 S.E.2d at 767. We further found that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ATp\">[t]he record fails to show that Coale exercised influence or authority over Lawrence or that they worked together to achieve some common goal or plan. Lawrence was motivated by her sense of fear and a desire to identify her unknown antagonist. She wanted to end the harassment, and to that end, she ignored Coale\u2019s admonitions and independently telephoned appellant and engaged him in conversations, which she recorded. Coale never supervised Lawrence or directed her to do anything. In fact, after hearing some early taped conversations, Coale directed Lawrence not to contact appellant anymore because the conversations failed to implicate appellant or further the investigation. He exercised no control or authority over her and offered no payment or reward. Moreover, Lawrence and Coale did not share a common purpose or plan.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b764-7\">Here, the Commonwealth concedes that Unknownuser acted solely in the interest of law enforcement, <em>see Jarrett, </em>338 F.3d at 345; <em>Jarrett, </em>229 F.Supp.2d at 516. Therefore, we will not belabor the second part of the two-prong test. However, the first prong, the question of whether Murphy, Duffy or Faulkner exercised influence or authority over Unknownuser, or whether they worked together to achieve what we called in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number><em>Sabo </em>a \u201ccommon goal or plan,\u201d bears further inquiry. As the Fourth Circuit put it, \u201cthe only question before us concerns the first factor \u2014 did the Government know of and acquiesce in Unknownuser\u2019s search in a manner sufficient to transform Unknownuser into an agent of the Government, and so render the search unconstitutional.\u201d <em>Jarrett, </em>338 F.3d at 345.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\"><em>Ellyson </em>proves instructive. In <em>Ellyson, </em>the defendant was convicted of possessing child pornography images. The conviction resulted from a 1998 police search of his North Carolina trailer on an unrelated matter. <em>Ellyson, </em>326 F.3d at 525. The results of the initial police search were not admitted by the trial judge because police had entered the trailer with neither Ellyson\u2019s permission nor a search warrant. <em>Id. </em>at 526. However, a tenant, Angela Burr, who also resided in the trailer, had turned over evidence of child pornography to 'police after visiting Ellyson in prison. Burr provided the material in the hope of being able to continue living in the trailer;<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> therefore, the material was deemed admissible. After concluding that the tenant had a \u201clegitimate independent motive\u201d for performing the search, the court reviewed the facts surrounding her relationships with law enforcement: \u201c[The tenant\u2019s] actions were not motivated by a desire to aid the police in building their case, but by a desire to preclude law enforcement from holding her responsible for any items subsequently discovered in the trailer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 528 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">Based on Burr\u2019s trial testimony as well as the testimony of various police officers, the court concluded that the police never asked Burr to visit Ellyson in jail. Further, because the police did not know Ellyson had asked the tenant to find and destroy child pornography on computer discs that the police had not seized in their prior, illegal search, the discs that the tenant found and turned over to the police were not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>the result of the initial search. \u201cThe police had not participated or acquiesced in the [second] search.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Therefore, the court concluded the tenant was not acting as an agent of the government in locating the evidence. Summarizing this first requirement of the agency prong, the court concluded that \u201cmore than mere knowledge and passive acquiescence by the Government [must exist] before finding an agency relationship. <em>See Ellyson, </em>326 F.3d at 527-28.\u201d <em>Jarrett, </em>338 F.3d at 345.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">\n<em>Agency Considerations Applied in Appellant\u2019s Case</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">Here, the question of whether Murphy, Duffy or Faulkner ever asked Unknownuser to search, seize and turn over to them any evidence of additional child pornographers is more problematical. Appellant argues that Duffy\u2019s continuing praise of Unknownuser for discovering Steiger\u2019s wrongdoing, and especially Duffy\u2019s invitation, \u201c[i]f you wish to bring other information forward, I am available,\u201d represents a thinly veiled entreaty that the hacker continue his illegal activities. Appellant also points to Faulkner\u2019s lengthy behind-the-scenes engagement with Unknownuser and her \u201cwink and a nod,\u201d suggestion, <em>Jarrett, </em>338 F.3d at 343 (that Unknownuser \u201cfeel free to send\u201d any pictures he might \u201chappen across\u201d) as acquiescence by the law enforcement officials to Unknownuser\u2019s hacking \u201cinvestigations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b766-7\">However, the Commonwealth argues that Duffy\u2019s statement related back to the Steiger case and represents at most, \u201ca vague offer of availability to receive more information in the future.\u201d <em>Jarrett, </em>338 F.3d at 347. We cannot say the trial court erred in agreeing with the Commonwealth. And, more importantly, Faulkner\u2019s December 19th appeal to Unknownuser for him to forward any incriminating evidence he might \u201chappen across,\u201d occurred more than two weeks after Unknownuser had \u201csearched\u201d appellant\u2019s computer and resulted in no further evidence against appellant. As the trial court stated in response to appellant\u2019s argument that the FaulknerUnknownuser correspondence evidenced their close relationship, their \u201cpost-December correspondence make[s] this a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>much closer case,\u201d but their \u201cpre-December 13 correspondence leads this court to conclude\u201d that Unknownuser was not a government agent. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">When Unknownuser wrote Murphy on December 3, 2001, informing him he had \u201ccollected all the evidence\u201d on appellant, the search was completed. Neither Murphy, Duffy nor Faulkner knew of Unknownuser\u2019s search of appellant\u2019s computer in advance of Murphy\u2019s receipt of the search results. As in <em>Ellyson, </em>the police agents were quite incapable of either knowing about or acquiescing in Unknownuser\u2019s search of appellant\u2019s computer. None knew Unknownuser\u2019s identity and could only guess at his domicile. Thus, the first prong of the two-part test, \u201cwhether the government knew of and acquiesced in the search,\u201d <em>Jarrett, </em>338 F.3d at 345; <em>Sabo, </em>38 Va.App. at 74-75, 561 S.E.2d at 766, also fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">Finally, appellant argues that none of the government agents dissuaded Unknownuser from his illegal hacking. Even so,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-7\">[t]hat the Government did not actively discourage Unknownuser from engaging in illicit hacking does not transform Unknownuser into a Government agent. Although the Government\u2019s behavior in this case is discomforting, the Government was under no special obligation to affirmatively discourage Unknownuser from hacking. <em>See Coolidge [v.

We have noted that this standard suggests a two-part analysis: \u201c(1) whether the government knew of and acquiesced in the search, and (2) whether the search was conducted for the purpose of assisting law enforcement efforts or for the purpose of furthering the private party\u2019s ends.\u201d <em>Mills v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 459, 463-64, 418 S.E.2d 718, 720 (1992). In conducting this analysis, \u201cthe ultimate question whether a private person is actually a government agent [is] a question that requires the application of a legal concept (agency) to facts.\u201d <em>United States v. Martin, </em>195 F.3d 961, 963 (7th Cir.1999). According to the usual standard of review, this legal determination of agency is subject to <em>de novo </em>review on appeal. <em>See Ornelas v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 690, 699, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 1663, 134 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b769-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">The evidence unambiguously established that Unknownuser\u2019s motivation for illegally hacking into William Adderson Jarrett\u2019s computer was to assist the law enforcement authorities in arresting and prosecuting child molesters. The record indicates that Unknownuser first contacted law enforcement authorities in July 2000 when he sent an e-mail message to the Montgomery, Alabama Police Department stating that he \u201cfound a child molester on the net.\u201d He then offered to send information he had stolen from Steiger\u2019s computer for their use in a prosecution. Throughout his correspondence in the Steiger matter, Unknownuser urged the law enforcement authorities to act promptly, and he consistently requested that the authorities keep him informed. Later, to facilitate his reporting of child molesters, he requested \u201can e-mail [address] of an FBI agent dealing with these kinds of crimes.\u201d Although the trial judge made no specific finding on the issue, I agree with the majority opinion that the F.B.I. \u201ceoncedefd] ... that Unknownuser\u2019s motivation for conducting the illicit searches stemmed solely from his interest in assisting law enforcement authorities.\u201d <em>United States v. Jarrett, </em>338 F.3d 339, 345 (4th Cir.2003). Indeed, on brief the Commonwealth does not contest this issue and asserts \u201cit is likely Unknown User\u2019s primary purpose was to assist law enforcement officers in prosecuting child pornographers.\u201d I would hold that Unknownuser acted for the purpose of assisting law enforcement efforts and, therefore, the evidence established the second part of the <em>Mills </em>analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">A significant factor in the first part of the analysis\u2014 \u201cwhether the government knew of or acquiesced in the search,\u201d <em>Mills, </em>14 Va.App. at 463, 418 S.E.2d at 720,\u2014is the determination whether \u201cthe Government did more than adopt a passive position toward the underlying private conduct.\u201d <em>Skinner, </em>489 U.S. at 615, 109 S.Ct. at 1412. Thus, the dispositive issue on appeal is whether the trial judge erred when he ruled that the evidence failed to establish \u201cgovernmental action\u201d and \u201cthat [Unknownuser] was independent of any act of the State or Federal government.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b770-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>The evidence proved that on December 4, 2001 Unknownuser sent to the F.B.I. e-mails containing materials he illegally obtained by hacking into Jarrett\u2019s computer and copying Jarrett\u2019s files. The evidence further proved that the F.B.I. had learned as early as July 2000 that Unknownuser had been performing illegal computer activities and that Unknownuser had obtained files by means of unlawful entry into Steiger\u2019s computer. After the F.B.I. began receiving e-mail files from Unknownuser in July 2000, the F.B.I. did not inform Unknownuser that his activity was illegal or tell him to stop his activities.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Instead, the F.B.I. encouraged him to continue those activities for the benefit of law enforcement prosecution. In November 2000, an-F.B.I. agent assured Unknownuser that \u201cUS authorities do not desire to prosecute [him]\u201d and would not arrest him. In that same month, an F.B.I. agent sent the following e-mail:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-5\">Thank you for being so honest. Please check your e-mail periodically as I may send you some questions. It will be your option to answer them. If you still have any additional images you captured from [Steiger\u2019s] computer that you believe will help this case, you may forward them to me at American Embassy.... Again its your option. Thank you for your help in stopping this man and thank you for your honesty. <em>If you want to bring other information forward, I am available.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b770-7\">In <em>United States v. Knoll, </em>16 F.3d 1313 (2nd Cir.1994), the evidence established that an Assistant U.S. Attorney told a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>private individual, who had stolen documents from the defendant and delivered them to the government in hopes of getting favorable treatment on his own criminal charges, that he needed to \u201cget ... more information,\u201d that \u201cyou\u2019ve got to turn more over,\u201d and that \u201cif there\u2019s stuff out there, you\u2019ve got to turn it over.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1320. In view of this evidence, the Second Circuit held that the government \u201ctacitly suggested and condoned further searching\u201d of defendant\u2019s private documents. <em>Id. </em>at 1319-20. Likewise, in this case, the F.B.I. agent\u2019s e-mail to Unknownuser contained an unambiguous solicitation \u201cto bring other information forward.\u201d The context of the message clearly reveals that this solicitation was made apart from the request to send \u201cadditional images ... from [Steiger\u2019s] computer.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Furthermore, in view of the previous assurance of immunity from arrest and prosecution, this solicitation moved the government beyond a mere \u201cpassive position toward the underlying private conduct.\u201d <em>Skinner, </em>489 U.S. at 615, 109 S.Ct. at 1411.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">The record indicates that several months after the F.B.I. agent solicited Unknownuser \u201cto bring other information forward,\u201d Unknownuser sent an e-mail on December 3, 2001, indicating that he \u201cfound another child molester\u201d and that he had \u201ccollected all the evidence.\u201d A police officer responded that \u201cthe FBI has asked that you send whatever information you have regarding this criminal complaint to my e-mail <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>address.\u201d Consistent with the earlier solicitation, Unknownuser then sent various files that he obtained illegally from Jarrett\u2019s computer.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">After the F.B.I. received these files by e-mail, an F.B.I. agent continued to correspond with Unknownuser and sent an e-mail that included the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-6\">But if you should happen across such pictures as the ones you have sent to us and wish us to look into the matter, please feel free to send them to us. We may have lots of questions and have to e-mail you with the questions. But as long as you are not \u201chacking\u201d at our request, we can take the pictures and identify the men and take them to court. We also have no desire to <em>charge </em>you with hacking. You are not a U.S. citizen and are not bound by our laws.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A52\">This further solicitation evidenced again the unambiguous message the F.B.I. earlier sent to Unknownuser: continue your criminal conduct and send the fruits of your efforts to us for prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-7\">In summary, the record suggests that Unknownuser was not acting at the urging of the F.B.I. when he first searched Steiger\u2019s computer and forwarded files from that computer to the F.B.I. The record reveals, however, that after that initial contact, the F.B.I. developed a relationship with Unknownuser that was intended to exploit Unknownuser\u2019s capabilities. Indeed, the F.B.I. agents actively encouraged Unknownuser to continue his activities in the following manner: (1) requesting his assistance in accessing Steiger\u2019s computer after they seized it, (2) informing him that they would neither arrest nor prosecute him for his criminal activities, (3) thanking him and praising him for his hunt for abusers, (4) assuring him that his information was valuable to them in finding and prosecuting law violators, (5) seeking his continued contact with the F.B.I., and (6) requesting him to \u201cbring forward other information\u201d that he accessed by hacking into computers. In so doing, \u201c[t]he government ... knowingly acquiesce[d] in and encourage[d] directly or indirectly a private citizen to engage in activity which [the government] is prohibited from pursu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>ing____\u201d <em>United States v. Walther, </em>652 F.2d 788, 793 (9th Cir.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">I would hold that the F.B.I. agent\u2019s assurances of immunity and solicitation for \u201cother information\u201d from the computer hacker were more than sufficient to prove the government had encouraged, solicited, and acquiesced in Unknownuser\u2019s activities, which were designed to assist law enforcement efforts. Those assurances of immunity and solicitations for information were extended before Unknownuser sent the e-mails and files to the F.B.I. containing information from Jarrett\u2019s computer, and they prove the F.B.I. was aware of Unknownuser\u2019s activities, acquiesced in those activities, and encouraged him to send to the F.B.I. the fruits of his activity. For these reasons, I would hold that the trial judge erred in denying the motion to suppress evidence, and I would reverse the convictions and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b770-8\">. Although Unknownuser indicated in an e-mail message that he was \"from Turkey,\u201d no evidence in the record established that he was a foreign national or that he could not be prosecuted in the United States. Although Unknownuser indicated that he could not afford to telephone because of the prohibitive cost of international telephone calls, the record indicates the F.B.I. learned of a telephone number in the United States registered to Unknownuser. After an F.B.I. agent left a message on the voice mail service connected to that telephone, Unknownuser sent an e-mail indicating he had received the message and commented on the agent's southern accent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b771-6\">. Although Unknownuser protested in an e-mail message that he lacked fluency in the English language, an F.B.I. agent testified that Unknownuser \"spoke English very well.\" Moreover, the following e-mail, as did many of his other e-mails, suggested no lack of facility with the language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-7\">Hello again. I know what had happened to Dr. Steiger. I made another criminal complaint about a child molester in Richmond, VA. I asked Major Kevin J. Murphy in Montgomery PD to help me. He said \"send me all the files. I\u2019ll send them to FBI and they will contact you.\u201d It's been 10 day and nobody called me. Are you retired or still in FBI? Please help me. I really want to know whats going on.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b771-8\">Indeed, the F.B.I.'s communications to Unknownuser and Unknownuser's responses to those communications belie the notion that Unknownuser lacked fluency in the English language.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
