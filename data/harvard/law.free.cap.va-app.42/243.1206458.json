Finding that the prosecutor\u2019s statements were not improper, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-15\">On appeal, we review the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth. <em>Kingsbur v. Commonwealth, </em>40 Va.App. 307, 308, 579 S.E.2d 357, 358 (2003). That principle requires us to discard the evidence of the accused in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>conflict with that of the Commonwealth and to regard as true all the credible evidence favorable to the Commonwealth and all fair inferences that may be drawn therefrom. <em>Dugger v. Commonwealth, </em>40 Va.App. 586, 589, 580 S.E.2d 477, 479 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">On November 9, 2001, Sergeant Darrell Duty and Officer Tim Sexton of the Bristol Police Department arranged for Emma Rollins, a confidential informant, to make a controlled purchase of crack cocaine. After providing a \u201cbody wire transmitter\u201d and searching Rollins and her pickup truck, the officers followed Rollins until she entered an apartment complex in Bristol. There, Rollins parked her truck in a parking lot. Within a few minutes, a car driven by Pollino pulled up next to Rollins\u2019s vehicle. After a brief conversation between Pollino and Rollins, a passenger in Pollino\u2019s car, Pig Stout, exited the front passenger seat of the vehicle and walked to the other end of an adjacent apartment building. Rollins then got into Pollino\u2019s car and asked for \u201c50 dollars worth of crack cocaine.\u201d After buying the drugs from Pollino, Rollins got back into her truck and drove away. Before she left, however, Pig Stout returned and got back into Pollino\u2019s vehicle. The entire encounter took between five to ten minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">Rollins met the officers a few minutes later and turned over the drugs she purchased from Pollino, which turned out to be .06 grams of crack cocaine. Pollino was arrested for possession with intent to distribute in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-248(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">At trial, Sergeant Duty and Rollins each gave a detailed description of the controlled buy and Pollino\u2019s subsequent arrest. Rollins also made clear that Stout accompanied Pollino to the parking lot and later got back into his vehicle after the transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">Pollino did not present any witnesses or evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-9\">In his closing argument, Pollino\u2019s attorney explained to the jury: \u2018We have no burden whatsoever in this case. We have no burden to produce any evidence. The burden\u2019s solely on the Commonwealth to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>Pollino\u2019s counsel then went on to attack Rollins\u2019s testimony, claiming \u201cPollino wasn\u2019t there on November 9th to sell drugs to Ms. Rollins or anyone else.\u201d She \u201cnever spoke\u201d to Pollino. \u201cNot once.\u201d Pollino, his counsel asserted, is \u201cnot a drug dealer. He never sold to her. He never sold to anyone. Never. And that\u2019s crystal clear.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Rollins should be disbelieved, Pollino\u2019s counsel also argued, because she was a criminal informant with charges pending against her. Her testimony was little more than an effort to \u201csave her own skin,\u201d he contended.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">In rebuttal argument, the prosecutor asked rhetorically: \u201cWhere is the evidence to dispute what Detective Duty and Emma Rollins testified to? It\u2019s interesting that the defense didn\u2019t mention Pig Stout. Where is Pig Stout?\u201d Pollino\u2019s counsel objected to this statement. Sustaining the objection, the trial court reminded the jury that \u201cthe defendant has no burden to present any evidence.\u201d The court overruled the defense\u2019s request for a mistrial, finding the oral admonition sufficient to address the problem if there was one.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">Immediately following the judge\u2019s cautionary instruction, the prosecutor clarified his point to the jury this way: \u201cAnd that what His Honor is saying is right. It is my burden, but there\u2019s opportunity, opportunity, to present evidence. Not required to, but opportunity.\u201d The trial judge interrupted the prosecutor and, once again, repeated that \u201cthe defendant has no burden to present any evidence. The burden is on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>prosecution, not the defendant.\u201d Later in his rebuttal argument, the prosecutor repeated this point: \u201cNow, it\u2019s my burden to prove this happened. My burden. Not his burden to prove innocence. No. No. None at all. Everybody understands that. It\u2019s my burden as Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d In the final instructions prior to the jury\u2019s deliberations, the trial court again repeated: \u201cThere is no burden on the defendant to produce any evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">Finding the testimony of Detective Duty and Emma Rollins persuasive, the jury found Pollino guilty of possession of cocaine with intent to distribute in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-248(A). Claiming that the trial court erred by not declaring a mistrial, Pollino now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">We begin our analysis with settled principles of appellate review. As a general rule, a trial court can remedy a situation that would otherwise warrant a new trial by sustaining an objection and instructing the jury \u201cto disregard the improper argument.\u201d <em>Velocity Express Mid-Atlantic, Inc. v. Hugen, </em>266 Va. 188, 198, 585 S.E.2d 557, 563 (2003). A new trial may be necessary, however, if \u201c \u2018counsel persists in such argument after the admonition of the court, or if it appears that the prejudicial influence of the argument was probably not wholly removed by the court\u2019s action.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Maxey v. Hubble, </em>238 Va. 607, 614-15, 385 S.E.2d 593, 596 (1989), and <em>Rinehart &amp; Dennis Co. v. Brown, </em>137 Va. 670, 676, 120 S.E. 269, 271 (1923)) (brackets omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-8\">We will reverse the trial court\u2019s decision to not declare a mistrial only upon determining that \u201ca manifest probability exists that the trial court\u2019s ruling was prejudicial.\u201d <em>Perez v. Commonwealth, </em>40 Va.App. 648, 654, 580 S.E.2d 507, 510 (2003) (citing <em>Taylor v. Commonwealth, </em>25 Va.App. 12, 17, 486 S.E.2d 108, 110 (1997)). The party requesting a mistrial has the burden of demonstrating the requisite \u201cprobability of prejudice.\u201d <em>Blevins v. Commonwealth, </em>40 Va.App. 412, 429-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>30, 579 S.E.2d 658, 666-67 (2003) (quoting <em>Green v. Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 394, 401, 494 S.E.2d 888, 891 (1998), and <em>Robertson v. Metro. Washington Airport Auth., </em>249 Va. 72, 76, 452 S.E.2d 845, 847 (1995)).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">Before determining whether the failure to declare a mistrial was prejudicial error, we must decide if there was any error in the first place. Pollino contends the predicate error can be found in the trial court\u2019s inadequate responses to the prosecutor\u2019s remarks during closing arguments. These remarks, Pollino argues, violated his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. By not doing more to blunt the impact of these statements, Pollino asserts, the trial judge left unremedied a breach of this constitutional right. We disagree. In our opinion, the prosecutor\u2019s remarks were not improper. It was unnecessary, therefore, for the trial judge to offer any cautionary instructions. The fact that he did anyway shows a commendable abundance of caution, not a prejudicial error requiring the reversal of Pollino\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">The Self-Incrimination Clause forbids imposing any penalty \u201con someone who exercises his core Fifth Amendment right not to be a \u2018witness\u2019 against himself in a \u2018criminal case.\u2019 \u201d <em>Chavez v. Martinez, </em>538 U.S. 760, 769, 123 S.Ct. 1994, 2002, 155 L.Ed.2d 984 (2003) (citing <em>Griffin v. California, </em>380 U.S. 609, 614, 85 S.Ct. 1229, 1232-33, 14 L.Ed.2d 106 (1965)). Under this constitutional privilege, no person can \u201cbe <em>compelled </em>to give self-incriminating testimony.\u201d <em>McKune v. Lile, </em>536 U.S. 24, 35-36, 122 S.Ct. 2017, 2026, 153 L.Ed.2d 47 (2002) (quoting <em>United States v. Washington, </em>431 U.S. 181, 188, 97 S.Ct. 1814, 1819, 52 L.Ed.2d 238 (1977)) (emphasis in original). Compulsion can be direct, like when a police officer coerces a confession, or indirect, like when a prosecutor argues to the jury that \u201ca defendant\u2019s silence is \u2018evidence of <em>guilt.\u2019 \u201d Portuondo v. Agard, </em>529 U.S. 61, 69, 120 S.Ct. 1119, 1125, 146 L.Ed.2d 47 (2000) (quoting <em>Griffin, </em>380 U.S. at 615, 85 S.Ct. at 1233) (emphasis in original and citation omitted); <em>Baxter v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number><em>Palmigiano, </em>425 U.S. 308, 319, 96 S.Ct. 1551, 1558, 47 L.Ed.2d 810 (1976).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">Based on the circumstances of the case, the constitutional propriety of the prosecutor\u2019s comments depends on whether \u201cthe language used was manifestly intended or was of such character that the jury would naturally and necessarily take it to be a comment on the [failure] of the accused to testify.\u201d <em>Hazel v. Commonwealth, </em>31 Va.App. 403, 411, 524 S.E.2d 134, 138 (2000) (quoting <em>Hines v. Commonwealth, </em>217 Va. 905, 907, 234 S.E.2d 262, 263 (1977), and <em>Knowles v. United States, </em>224 F.2d 168, 170 (10th Cir.1955)) (bracketed word in <em>Knowles </em>and Hines); <em>see also Johnson v. Commonwealth, </em>236 Va. 48, 50, 372 S.E.2d 134, 136 (1988); <em>United States v. Francis, </em>82 F.3d 77, 78-79 (4th Cir.1996). Thus, a comment on the defendant\u2019s failure to contradict the incriminating evidence presented by the prosecution does not offend the Fifth Amendment if, in context, the comment could be understood to refer to contradictory evidence from sources other than the defendant. <em>See Johnson, </em>236 Va. at 51, 372 S.E.2d at 136 (\u201c[A] prosecutor\u2019s comment that the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence was uncontradicted was not necessarily a reference to the defendant\u2019s failure to testify but an argument that the testimony of the witnesses who had testified was credible.\u201d) (citing <em>Washington v. Commonwealth, </em>216 Va. 185, 195, 217 S.E.2d 815, 824 (1975)).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>These same principles apply to comments noting the absence of a potentially favorable witness. While a trial court cannot instruct a jury to draw an adverse presumption from the defendant\u2019s failure to call a witness, <em>Harris v. Commonwealth, </em>33 Va.App. 290, 295, 533 S.E.2d 1, 3 (2000), that failure nonetheless remains \u201ca <em>circumstance, </em>not a presumption, for jury consideration,\u201d <em>Russell v. Commonwealth, </em>216 Va. 833, 836, 223 S.E.2d 877, 879 (1976) (emphasis in original). Thus, the \u201cfailure or neglect of an accused to produce evidence within his power might be considered by the jury in connection with the other facts proved in the case.\u201d <em>Robinson v. Commonwealth, </em>165 Va. 876, 880, 183 S.E. 254, 256 (1936). And because \u201cthe Sixth Amendment provides that the accused shall enjoy the right ... to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor,\u201d <em>Harris, </em>33 Va.App. at 294, 533 S.E.2d at 3 (quoting <em>United States v. Scheffer, </em>523 U.S. 303, 326, 118 S.Ct. 1261, 1273, 140 L.Ed.2d 413 (1998)), the absence of a potential defense witness allows the jury to infer that the witness would not have corroborated the defendant\u2019s position, <em>Robinson, </em>165 Va. at 880, 183 S.E. at 256. In such circumstances, the topic presents a \u201clegitimate subject of comment by the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney.\u201d <em>Harris, </em>33 Va.App. at 294, 533 S.E.2d at 2 (quoting <em>Robinson, </em>165 Va. at 881, 183 S.E. at 256).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>Guided by these principles, we find no constitutional infirmity with the prosecutor\u2019s remarks during closing argument. The prosecutor pointed out the absence of any evidence \u201cto dispute\u201d the Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses in the same breath as his rhetorical \u201cWhere is Pig Stout?\u201d question. After the trial court\u2019s cautionary instruction, the prosecutor rephrased his point as one merely noting Pollino\u2019s \u201copportunity\u201d to present such evidence. Each of these remarks, in context, focused on the conspicuous absence of Pig Stout \u2014 a fair observation, to be sure.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">If Pollino had not accompanied Stout to the parking lot and then later left with him, as Rollins testified, Stout could have taken the stand and said so. If Rollins\u2019s testimony was a complete fabrication and Stout was nowhere in the vicinity that night, he likewise could have said that as well. In either case, Stout\u2019s testimony (had it been favorable to Pollino) would have supported counsel\u2019s claim that Pollino \u201cwasn\u2019t there on November 9th to sell drugs to Ms. Rollins or anyone else\u201d and that \u201cHe never sold to her. He never sold to anyone.\u201d By asserting this variant of a missing-witness inference, therefore, the prosecutor did not use language that \u201cwas manifestly intended or was of such character that the jury would naturally and necessarily take it to be a comment on the [failure] of the accused to testify.\u201d <em>Hazel, </em>31 Va.App. at 411, 524 S.E.2d at 138 (citation omitted).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b303-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">Finding that the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument did not violate Pollino\u2019s Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination, we affirm the trial court\u2019s decision not to grant a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b297-7\">. The prosecutor did not object to the defense attorney\u2019s argument as <em>de facto </em>testimony by counsel. <em>See generally Velocity Express Mid-Atlantic, Inc. v. Hugen, </em>266 Va. 188, 199, 585 S.E.2d 557, 563 (2003) (observing that, in closing argument, counsel \u201chas no right to testify in argument nor to assume that there is evidence which has no existence\u2019\u2019) (quoting <em>Atl. Coast Realty Co. v. Robertson's Ex\u2019r, </em>135 Va. 247, 263, 116 S.E. 476, 481 (1923)). It is one thing to argue that the incriminating evidence, whatever its weight, still leaves a residuum of reasonable doubt as to the defendant\u2019s guilt' \u2014 and, in doing so, seek to negate the prosecution's case. It is quite another to affirmatively declare (absent any supporting evidence) that the defendant was not even present at the time the crime occurred, or at the location where it took place, or with the person who allegedly saw him then and there.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b300-5\">. Not all references to a defendant\u2019s failure to testify, however, automatically violate the Fifth Amendment. \"[A] reference to the defendant\u2019s failure to take the witness stand may, in context, be perfectly proper.\u201d <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>485 U.S. 25, 33 n. 5, 108 S.Ct. 864, 869 n. 5, 99 L.Ed.2d 23 (1988).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b300-6\">. <em>See also Frye v.

Commonwealth, </em>224 Va. 127, 146, 295 S.E.2d 643, 652 (1982) (holding no error occurs by questioning the lack of contradictory evidence where the prosecutor does not suggest that \u201cthe missing evidence should have come from [the defendant] himself or that it could come from him alone\u201d). Prohibiting such comments \"would be to make silence, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>usual refuge of the guilty, still more secure.\u201d <em>Miller v. Commonwealth, </em>153 Va. 890, 902, 149 S.E. 459, 462 (1929) (recognizing that bar against commenting on defendant\u2019s failure to testify was \"not intended primarily to curtail any previously existing right of the prosecutor to comment upon the testimony of any other witness who had testified\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b301-6\">. Even if a prosecutor arguably crosses the line with his remarks, it still may be appropriate if the defendant's arguments fairly invite such an incursion. <em>Johnson, </em>236 Va. at 51, 372 S.E.2d at 136; <em>Lincoln v. Commonwealth, </em>217 Va. 370, 373, 228 S.E.2d 688, 690 (1976). An argument or comment \"by a prosecutor, otherwise improper, may become proper under the invited error doctrine when the area has been opened to fair comment by the argument and comment of defense counsel or of a <em>pro se </em>defendant.\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>236 Va. at 51, 372 S.E.2d at 136. Thus, even when a prosecutor specifically comments on the \"defendant's opportunity to testify,\u201d no Fifth Amendment violation occurs if the comment \"is a fair response to a claim made by defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>or his counsel____\" <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>485 U.S. 25, 32, 108 S.Ct. 864, 869, 99 L.Ed.2d 23 (1988).

Pollino has never asserted that Pig Stout does not exist or that, even if he did, no one could find him at the time of trial. Stout had been subpoenaed by the Commonwealth and appeared on the day of trial. Pollino\u2019s counsel conceded during oral argument before us that he could have put Stout on the witness stand but, for tactical reasons, chose not to.
