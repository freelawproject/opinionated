On appeal, he contends the trial court erred in denying his motion for a new trial because the jury panel from which the jury for his trial was chosen was not randomly selected. He argues the trial court improperly permitted members of the term jury pool to volunteer for the jury panel. Finding no error, we affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment and Reeves\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">On December 14, 2001, after a four-day trial, a jury in the Circuit Court of Albemarle County convicted Reeves of the first-degree murder of his former wife, Deborah Yount Reeves, and of breaking and entering.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">On March 1, 2002, Reeves filed a motion for a new trial, alleging that, while awaiting sentencing, he learned the jury in his case had been chosen in an \u201cirregular and unlawful fashion.\u201d Specifically, Reeves argued the trial court violated Code \u00a7 8.01-357\u2019s mandate that \u201c[t]he jurors should be selected randomly\u201d when, at the jury orientation held on December 3, 2001, the court requested and accepted volunteers from the jury pool to be on his jury panel.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">In support of his motion, Reeves submitted an affidavit executed on January 25, 2002, by Sandra V. Arbogast. In her affidavit, Arbogast stated that, having been \u201ccalled as a potential juror to serve during the December 2001 Term of Court for the Circuit Court of Albemarle County,\u201d she attended an orientation session for that term\u2019s prospective jurors on December 3, 2001. Arbogast further stated in her affidavit that the following events occurred during and after that orientation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-8\">A. The judge or clerk told the group that everyone had to serve at least five days during the term. He explained that an approximately four day criminal trial would take place during the week of December 11, 2001, and that jurors who volunteered to serve on that panel would not be required to serve on any additional days during that term if selected for actual service on the jury panel. Thereafter, people began raising hands to volunteer for the four day trial and their names were taken. I raised my hand and was selected as a potential juror for the criminal trial set to start on December 11, 2001.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-9\">B. I appeared at the Circuit Court of Albemarle County on December 11, 2001. I was not selected to be part of the jury panel and was dismissed. Because I was not selected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>for service on this trial, I remained eligible for further service during that term.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">The trial court conducted a hearing on Reeves\u2019s motion for a new trial on April 17, 2002. At that hearing, the trial judge informed the parties that he was present at the jury orientation conducted on December 3, 2001, and confirmed defense counsel\u2019s representation that there was no court reporter there. Because there was no transcript of that proceeding, the trial judge expressed his willingness to state for the record his recollection \u201cof what happened [at the orientation] and how the jury was selected,\u201d to which defense counsel responded, \u201cYes, sir. We would accept your \u2014 the Court\u2019s representations to this regard.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">The Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney then informed the trial court that he objected to the introduction of Arbogast\u2019s affidavit into evidence because, based on a conversation he had with Arbogast the week before the hearing, the affidavit did not accurately reflect Arbogast\u2019s recollection of what the judge or clerk said about the four-day trial that would start on December 11, 2001. Were Arbogast called to testify, the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney explained, she \u201cwould not necessarily say\u201d the judge or clerk described the four-day trial as a criminal trial.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">After further discussion of the Commonwealth\u2019s objection, the following colloquy took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-8\">THE COURT: ... So, why don\u2019t we do this. The affidavit is here as Exhibit B. [The Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney] has represented that he talked to the affiant, Sandra Arbogast, and is your representation, she doesn\u2019t remember the word criminal being used?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-9\">[COMMONWEALTH\u2019S ATTORNEY]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-10\">THE COURT: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-11\">[COMMONWEALTH\u2019S ATTORNEY]: Her representation to me, was she remembers hearing the word criminal. She doesn\u2019t remember whether she heard it at the orienta<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>tion or on December 11th, the first day of trial. She doesn\u2019t remember when she heard it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-5\">THE COURT: So are you willing to have [the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney\u2019s representation] be considered or at least\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-6\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Yes, that\u2019s to be considered. It could have been at orientation or it could have been at a later time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-7\">THE COURT: On the day of the trial?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-8\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Date of trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-9\">THE COURT: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-10\">[COMMONWEALTH\u2019S ATTORNEY]: Date of the trial, there is a major significance there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-11\">THE COURT: I understand. So let me go ahead and tell you what I remember [about the orientation]. On December 3rd, it\u2019s term day. And we have a hundred and twenty-five (125) jurors summoned ... [,] selected randomly from the master pool. So a hundred and twenty-five (125) less anybody that had been excused for orientation were here for jury selection. The Court looks over its docket and sees how many trials it has for the term of December and January. Historically it is a light term because of the Christmas holiday. So we normally don\u2019t have jury trials from the 20th of December through after the new year. Traditionally the Court assigns six jury days at orientation. So jurors are asked to bring in calendars and the Court assigns days for jury service. And people who have conflicts are then able to take another date if a date suggested is not agreeable with the calendar. On this particular term it was announced that there was a four-day trial in December. I can honestly tell you I do not remember whether the word criminal or civil was mentioned. I believe it was a multi-day, four-day trial. And the Court stated that if jurors were willing to serve for a continuous four-day period that that would satisfy \u2014 and I was either handing out five or six days as jury days. It\u2019s normally six, but if it\u2019s a light docket it could be five. But the way it was presented to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>panel was I need jurors for the four-day trial, and then I\u2019m going to assign other jury dates to the remaining jurors present. So everybody got dates assigned. So it was announced that I needed to have a show of hands of people who could do the four-day trial beginning December 11th. I took hands and went around the room randomly to identify people and have those people assigned for that jury trial. And I was \u2014 my goal was to get forty (40) people to be on the panel and my recollection is I got up to thirty-nine (39) and that\u2019s all I could get in the terms of hands [of] people who could do it, and so we stopped at thirty-nine (39). I then assigned jury dates to the remaining jurors who were here. So all jurors got dates assigned on December 3rd for jury duty. And I do also recall that counsel objected to one of the jurors summoned because the juror was the wife of Detective Hope. So you all eliminated that person and we got another juror to replace is my recollection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-5\">[COMMONWEALTH\u2019S ATTORNEY]: Yes, sir, I notified the Court a couple of weeks in advance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-6\">THE COURT: And that\u2019s what tends to tell me that maybe I didn\u2019t say it was a criminal trial. But I didn\u2019t even know Officer Hope\u2019s wife was in that thirty-nine (39). So I\u2019m not sure I distinguished that the four-day trial was civil or criminal, but I\u2019m not betting my life on it, because I don\u2019t remember. But anyway, that\u2019s what I remember as to how things happened on that day.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">The trial judge added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-8\">The only other thing I would supplement was that I \u2014 I believe I recall, because I do this every term, is that there were no capital cases on the docket, so, you know, if anybody was concerned about a death penalty case, I just make the general announcement none of these trials are death penalties. But I didn\u2019t make any comment about this four-day trial that I can recall. I mean, it certainly wasn\u2019t a death penalty case, so I made that general announcement, but I do not recall whether I said criminal or civil. My inclination is that I said a four-day, but you can argue it all three ways, it\u2019s fine.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b707-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>The trial court subsequently received Arbogast\u2019s affidavit \u201csubject to [the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney\u2019s] representation that it was either at orientation or the day of trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">Reeves presented one witness in support of his motion for a new trial, Jacob Van Bowen, Jr., a retired professor of statistics, who qualified as an expert in the field of statistical analysis. Van Bowen presented a statistical analysis in which he had been asked to compare, in terms of race, age, and employment, the 125 members of the jury pool for the December/January term of court with the 38 members of the 40-member jury panel from which the jury for Reeves\u2019s trial was selected. Van Bowen explained that, because two members of the jury panel were not members of the jury pool, he did not include them in his statistical analysis. Van Bowen performed his analysis by reviewing the \u201cList of Veniremen\u201d for the Deeember/January term and the \u201cJury List\u201d of the panel for Reeves\u2019s trial. Because the lists provided no information regarding the race of the members of the pool and panel, Van Bowen assumed, for purposes of his statistical analysis, that there was only one African American on the jury panel and that the jury pool had exactly the same racial composition as the population of Albemarle County at large. No evidence of the racial make-up of the jury pool or panel was presented at the hearing.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Van Bowen further assumed, based on information apparently from the United States Census Bureau on a print-out \u201cpossibly off the internet,\u201d that the African-American population of Albemarle County was 9.7% of the county\u2019s overall population. Based on these assumptions, Van Bowen concluded that it was \u201cunlikely\u201d (meaning less than a 5% probability) that a random selection process would have resulted in a jury panel of the age and racial make-up of the jury panel in Reeves\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>Van Bowen also testified that the master list for the December/January term included \u201cthree professors, three registered nurses, two physicians, two medical technicians and one health physicist.\u201d When asked if any of those people appeared on the list for the jury panel, he testified, \u201cI didn\u2019t check, but I didn\u2019t see those.\u201d He then stated that, although he had not calculated the percentage, the chances were \u201cexceedingly small\u201d that a random selection process would have resulted in the exclusion of all eleven of those people. The 40 members of the panel included, among others, a forensic toxicologist, two nurses, a social worker, a scientist, three teachers, a CEO, two executives, a vice president, two managers, an editor, a writer, and an insurance underwriter. Only two on the panel were listed as being retired.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">On cross-examination, Van Bowen acknowledged that the difference between the average age of the members of the jury pool and average age of the members of the jury panel was \u201cstatistically insignificant\u201d by itself and became significant only when combined with the racial disparity between those groups. He further acknowledged that, if the racial make-up of the jury pool did not coincide, as he assumed, with the racial make-up of the county at large, he \u201ccalculated the wrong thing.\u201d He also acknowledged that, if, contrary to his assumption, there were two African Americans on the jury panel instead of only one, the result of his statistical analysis \u201cwould be substantially different from what [he] calculated\u201d and he would no longer be able to conclude that it was unlikely that a random selection process would have resulted in a jury panel of the age and racial make-up of such a panel.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">\u25a0 After hearing argument, the trial court denied Reeves\u2019s motion for a new trial, specifically finding, <em>inter alia, </em>that there was \u201cno irregularity\u201d in the jury-selection process.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-8\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b708-9\">On appeal, Reeves concedes, as he did below, that the members of the 125-person jury pool for the December/Janu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>ary term and the members of his jury itself were properly chosen using random selection processes, as required by state law. He asserts, however, that the prospective jurors on the 40-member panel from which his jury was selected were not randomly selected because they were improperly permitted at the December 3, 2001 jury orientation \u201cto volunteer\u201d to serve on the jury panel for his four-day criminal trial. As a result, Reeves argues, the panel was \u201cstatistically dissimilar\u201d in terms of race, age, and the \u201cpresence of health-care employees or professionals\u201d from the panel that would have been selected had a random selection process been used. Thus corrupted, Reeves maintains, the panel could not then be cured by the random selection of the jury itself. Hence, Reeves contends, in allowing the members of the jury pool \u201cto volunteer for the trial on which they would sit,\u201d the trial court deprived him of a randomly selected jury, in violation of Code \u00a7 8.01-357.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Accordingly, he concludes, the trial court erred in refusing to grant his motion for a new trial. We disagree.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-5\">The right to a trial by an impartial jury is guaranteed under both the United States and Virginia Constitutions. <em>See </em>U.S. Const. Amend. VI; Va. Const, art I, \u00a7 8. This guarantee is reinforced by legislative enactment and by the rules of court. Code \u00a7\u00a7 8.01-357, 8.01-358; Rule 3A:14(a)(7). It is the trial judge\u2019s duty to secure an impartial jury for the parties. <em>Salina v. Commonwealth, </em>217 Va. 92, 93, 225 S.E.2d 199, 200 (1976).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b709-6\"><em>Gosling v. Commonwealth, </em>7 Va.App. 642, 645, 376 S.E.2d 541, 543 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">Here, Reeves filed a motion in the trial court requesting a new trial. In that motion he challenged the propriety of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>convictions on the ground that the jury in his case had been chosen in an \u201cirregular and unlawful fashion,\u201d because the trial court permitted members of the jury pool \u201cto volunteer\u201d to serve on the jury panel for his trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">Reeves\u2019s motion for a new trial was made pursuant to Code \u00a7 8.01-352, which provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-6\">A. Prior to the jury being sworn, the following objections may be made without leave of court: (i) an objection specifically pointing out the irregularity in any list or lists of jurors made by the clerk from names drawn from the jury box, or in the drawing, summoning, returning or impaneling of jurors or in copying or signing to failing to sign the list, and (ii) an objection to any juror on account of any legal disability; after the jury is sworn such objection shall be made only with leave of court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-7\">B. Unless objection to such irregularity or disability is made pursuant to subsection A herein and unless it appears that the irregularity was intentional or that the irregularity or disability be such as to probably cause injustice in a criminal case to the Commonwealth or to the accused and in a civil case to the party making the objection, then such irregularity or disability shall not be cause for summoning a new panel or juror or for setting aside a verdict or granting a new trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b710-8\">Thus, in order to be granted a new trial on the basis of his motion, Reeves had the burden of establishing (1) that there was an irregularity in the impaneling of the 40-member jury panel from which his jury was selected and (2) that such irregularity was either intentional or caused prejudice to him. <em>See O\u2019Dell v. Commonwealth, </em>234 Va. 672, 690, 364 S.E.2d 491, 501 (1988). Upon our review of the record, we agree with the trial court that Reeves failed to prove that any irregularity had occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-9\">\u201cUnder familiar principles of appellate review, we examine the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the prevailing party below, granting to it all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom.\u201d <em>King v. Commonwealth, </em>264 Va. 576, 578, 570 S.E.2d 863, 864 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">Applying this standard to the record before us, we initially note that the evidence is in equipoise as to whether the members of the 125-person jury pool were informed at the jury orientation session that the four-day trial starting on December 11, 2001, was a criminal trial. The trial judge, who was present at the orientation session, clearly said, \u201cI\u2019m not sure I distinguished that the four-day trial was civil or criminal, but ... I don\u2019t remember.\u201d In addition, the trial judge received Arbogast\u2019s affidavit subject to the stipulation that it proved she learned the trial was criminal either at the day of trial or at the orientation session. Thus, in the absence of other evidence, this evidence was in a state of equipoise as to whether the 125-person jury pool learned that the four-day trial was criminal.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">We hold, however, that the record is devoid of relevant credible evidence that supports Reeves\u2019s claim that the jury panel from which his jury was selected was \u201cstatistically dissimilar\u201d in terms of race, age, and the \u201cpresence of healthcare employees or professionals\u201d from the panel that would have been selected had a random selection process been used at the orientation. In asserting that claim, Reeves relies solely on Van Bowen\u2019s testimony regarding his statistical analysis of the list of prospective jurors on the December/January term pool and the list of prospective jurors selected at the orientation to serve on the panel from which the jury for Reeves\u2019s trial was chosen. Based on his analysis, Van Bowen concluded that the make-up of Reeves\u2019s jury panel, in terms of age, race, and employment, was unlikely to occur as a result of a random selection process.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">Our review of the record, however, reveals two major evidentiary flaws in Van Bowen\u2019s analysis that, for purposes of this appeal, render his conclusions essentially meaningless. First, Reeves argues that the statistical analysis demonstrates a disparity in health-care professionals between the jury pool and jury panel. Van Bowen testified at the hearing that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>master list for the jury pool included \u201cthree professors, three registered nurses, two physicians, two medical technicians and one health physicist.\u201d When asked, however, if any of those people appeared on the list for the jury panel, he testified, \u201cI didn\u2019t check, but I didn\u2019t see those.\u201d He then stated that, although he had not calculated the percentage, the chances were \u201cexceedingly small\u201d that a random selection process would have resulted in the exclusion of all eleven of those people. Van Bowen did not explain and the record does not disclose the relevance of such a statistical analysis. Although those eleven people were not on the jury panel, the record indicates that other health-care employees and professionals were on the panel, including a forensic toxicologist, two nurses, a social worker, a scientist, three teachers, a CEO, two executives, a vice president, two managers, an editor, a writer, and an insurance underwriter. The failure of the analysis to include these jurors and to explain the relevance of the others discounts its validity.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">Second, it is clear from Van Bowen\u2019s testimony at the hearing that two assumptions were critical to his determination that the combined age and racial disparity between the jury pool and the jury panel was not likely the product of a random selection process. Specifically, Van Bowen assumed, without any specific knowledge thereof, that the racial composition of the jury pool mirrored the racial composition of Albemarle County and that there was only one African American on the jury panel. No evidence providing a basis for either of these assumptions was presented at the hearing. In light of Van Bowen\u2019s testimony that the age disparity was statistically significant only when combined with the racial disparity, these assumptions were plainly essential to his conclusions. Indeed, Van Bowen acknowledged that, if there had been two African Americans on the panel, he could not have characterized the age and racial make-up of the panel as an unlikely product of a random selection process. He further acknowledged that, if the racial make-up of the jury pool did not mirror the county\u2019s racial composition, he \u201ccalculated the wrong thing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b713-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>Having no basis in evidence, Van Bowen\u2019s conclusions amount to nothing more than mere speculation and conjecture. It is axiomatic that an appellant cannot establish reversible error by the trial court based on nothing more than speculation or conjecture. <em>See, e.g., Cardwell v. Commonwealth, </em>248 Va. 501, 508, 450 S.E.2d 146, 151 (1994) (observing that the requisite showing on appeal of prejudice to a defendant by the denial of a continuance motion cannot be based on \u201cmere speculation\u201d). We conclude, therefore, that Reeves\u2019s claim that the jury panel from which his jury was selected was \u201cstatistically dissimilar\u201d in terms of race, age, and the \u201cpresence of health-care employees or professionals\u201d from the panel that would have been selected had a random selection process been used at the orientation is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">Turning our attention to the actual selection by the trial court of the members of the panel from which Reeves\u2019s jury was chosen, we find that no irregularity occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">Code \u00a7 8.01-355, which governs the stage of jury selection at issue here, provides that the \u201cjudge shall direct the selection of as many jurors as may be necessary to appear for the trial of any case. Any court shall have power to discharge persons summoned as jurors therein, or to dispense with their attendance on any day of its sitting.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">Here, contrary to Reeves\u2019s characterization of those who served on the panel as \u201cvolunteers,\u201d we hold, based on the trial judge\u2019s description of what took place at the orientation, that the court did not improperly request and accept \u201cvolunteers\u201d to serve on the panel. Initially, we note that the record indicates that the jurors who are summoned in this jurisdiction \u201care asked to bring in calendars\u201d to the orientation session. At that session, the trial judge, after explaining to the prospective jurors that they would all be assigned dates for jury service and that service \u201cfor a continuous four-day period\u201d would satisfy their jury duty for the term, announced that he needed jurors for a four-day trial starting on December 11, 2001. The trial judge then asked for \u201ca show of hands of people who <em>could do </em>the four-day trial.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>Upon receiving a show of hands, the trial judge \u201cwent around the room randomly to identify people and have those people assigned for that jury trial.\u201d Hoping \u201cto get forty ... people to be on the panel,\u201d the trial judge found only thirty-nine members of the pool \u201cwho could do it.\u201d The trial judge then assigned jury dates to the remaining prospective jurors in the pool. The court \u201cwas ... handing out five or six days as jury days.\u201d All of the members of the pool \u201cgot dates assigned.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">We conclude that, in selecting the jury panel from which Reeves\u2019s jury was chosen, the trial court did not seek out those members of the jury pool who expressed a desire to serve on the panel. Instead, the court sought out those members of the pool who indicated they were available to serve on the panel. In other words, the court separated those members of the pool who were able to serve as a juror on the four-day trial from those who were not. The judge reasonably could conclude that the jurors made that decision based in part on their calendars. Those who could serve those dates were assigned to the panel for the four-day trial; those who could not were assigned other dates. All members of the pool were assigned dates to serve.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">Certainly, a trial court\u2019s discretion under Code \u00a7 8.01-355 permits it to avoid unnecessarily imposing a particular jury assignment upon a member of the jury pool who is unable to serve that assignment without undue burden, if the court sees fit to do so. <em>See United States v. Anderson, </em>509 F.2d 312, 322 (D.C.Cir.1974). Here the court\u2019s \u201cendeavor was to eliminate the tedious process of examining one by one the obviously large group who would seek to be excused for that reason.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In distinguishing between those who could serve on the four-day trial and those who could not, \u201cthe judge did not exclude anyone or any cognizable group. The sole criterion he employed was ability to serve ...; the panel from which the jury was drawn was distinguished only by that quality.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">Hence, we conclude that the methodology employed by the trial court in selecting the jury panel in this case was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>irregular and did not violate Reeves\u2019s right to a trial by an impartial jury. We hold, therefore, that, because Reeves failed to meet his burden of proving that there was an irregularity in the impaneling of the jury panel, the trial court did not err in denying his motion for a new trial.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">Accordingly, we affirm Reeves\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b704-12\">. Neither party presented Arbogast as a witness at the hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b707-6\">. Defense counsel asked the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney to stipulate that there had been only one African American on the 40 member jury panel, but the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney replied that he could not recall how many of the members of the panel were African Americans. Similarly, the trial judge indicated that he, too, could not recall the number of African Americans on the panel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b709-8\">. Code \u00a7 8.01-357, which applies to the selection of the jury itself, provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-9\">On the day on which jurors have been notified to appear, jurors not excused by the court shall be called in such manner as the judge may direct to be sworn on their voir dire until a panel free from exceptions shall be obtained. The jurors shall be selected randomly. The remaining jurors may be discharged or excused subject to such orders as the court shall make.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b715-19\">. Having determined that Reeves failed to establish an irregularity, we do not address whether the claimed irregularity was intentional or caused prejudice to Reeves.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
