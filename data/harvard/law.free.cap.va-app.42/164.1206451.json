Via contends that the trial court erred by: 1) \u201cprompting and soliciting evidentiary objections from the Commonwealth\u201d and \u201cberating and belittling defense counsel,\u201d while in the presence of the jury; 2) refusing to admit relevant impeachment evidence; 3) refusing to quash the Commonwealth\u2019s subpoena <em>duces tecum, </em>requesting records and information in possession of a defense expert; and 4) erroneously applying the \u201cRape Shield Statute.\u201d For the reasons that follow, we affirm Via\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-9\">I. <em>Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b219-10\">\u201cOn appeal, we review the evidence in the light most favorable to the party prevailing below, together with all reasonable inferences that may be drawn.\u201d <em>Benton v. Commonwealth, </em>40 Va.App. 136, 139, 578 S.E.2d 74, 75 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-11\">So viewed, the relevant evidence established that on October 22, 2001, an Augusta County grand jury indicted Via for \u201cunlawfully and feloniously engag[ing] in eunnilingus with [L.V.], a child under the age of 13 years, in violation of [Code \u00a7 18.2-67.1],\u201d and \u201cunlawfully and feloniously having sexual intercourse with his daughter, [L.V.], a child at least thirteen years of age but less than eighteen years of age, in violation of [Code \u00a7 18.2-366].\u201d The sodomy indictment alleged that the purported events took place between January 1, 1998 and September 1, 1998. The indictment alleging incest stated that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>the purported events took place between January 1, 1999 and August 4, 2001.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">Prior to Via\u2019s trial on these charges, the Commonwealth issued a subpoena <em>duces tecum </em>to Joseph C. Conley, Ph.D., requesting \u201cany and all medical and counseling records, notes and exams and all information relating to [L.V.].\u201d Via\u2019s counsel filed a motion to quash the subpoena, contending that Conley was engaged by Via as a defense expert witness \u201cto test and evaluate [L.V.].\u201d Thus, Via\u2019s counsel contended Conley\u2019s records were subject to the attorney/client privilege arguing,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AyP\">all communications to and with [Dr. Conley] were made because of the attorney-client relationship between the [defendant and his attorney, concerned the subject matter of the attorney\u2019s employment, and were communications made to the attorney\u2019s agent, said agent\u2019s ([Dr.Conley]) services being indispensable to the attorney\u2019s effective representation of the [defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">Via\u2019s counsel further argued that the records \u201cpertaining to the minor child complaining witness\u201d were subject to the work product doctrine and that they were not \u201csubject to discovery by the Commonwealth pursuant to Rules of the Virginia Supreme Court, Rule 3A:ll(c).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">The trial court heard argument on the motion on January 29, 2002. Recognizing that there is no \u201cphysician/client privilege\u201d in criminal matters, the trial court overruled the motion \u201cwith respect to any statements made to \u2014 anything in this that came from this child,\u201d the victim. Nevertheless, the trial court granted Via\u2019s counsel time to submit authority for the proposition that any statements made to Dr. Conley by Via would be \u201c[injadmissible.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">Both Via\u2019s counsel and the Commonwealth later submitted additional authority to the court, related to the motion to quash. Via\u2019s counsel contended that the Commonwealth was precluded from obtaining Dr. Conley\u2019s records, pursuant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>Rule 3A:11, as well as the Fifth, Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments. Via\u2019s counsel again argued that the records were subject to the attorney/client privilege and the attorney work product doctrine because Dr. Conley was an agent of the defense and Dr. Conley\u2019s services were \u201cindispensable\u201d to her effective representation of Via. Via\u2019s counsel further argued that any statements made by Paula Via, Via\u2019s wife and the victim\u2019s adoptive mother, were also subject to the attorney/client privilege as she shared a \u201ccommon interest\u201d in Via\u2019s defense because the Commonwealth had \u201cintimated\u201d she may also face criminal charges. Finally, Via\u2019s counsel asked the trial court to reconsider its ruling with respect to statements made to Dr. Conley by L.V. After giving both parties the opportunity to argue the motion further, the trial court overruled the motion to quash the subpoena <em>duces tecum.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">Approximately one month prior to Via\u2019s trial, the Commonwealth filed a motion <em>in limine </em>requesting that Via\u2019s counsel be precluded from introducing at trial any evidence concerning \u201calleged prior sexual abuse of the victim, [L.V.],\u201d as well as \u201cother alleged sexual activity of the victim, [L.V.].\u201d The Commonwealth based its objection on relevance and the Virginia \u201cRape Shield Statute,\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-67.7.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">The trial court heard argument on the Commonwealth\u2019s motion on February 25, 2002.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Via\u2019s counsel contended that because the incest charge did not fall within the ambit of Article 7 of Title 18 .2 (prescribing criminal sexual assault), the \u201cRape Shield Statute\u201d did not apply. Via\u2019s counsel stated that the evidence she intended to elicit would establish that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>L.V. made prior reports of abuse, directed at her birth father, as well as her birth mother\u2019s boyfriend. Via\u2019s counsel contended this evidence would tend to establish that L.V. knew how to make a complaint of abuse, and knew that making such a complaint would have the effect of \u201cseparating\u201d her from the person she made the complaint against. Via\u2019s counsel stated she also intended to introduce evidence concerning L.V.\u2019s alleged other sexual activity during the time at issue, as well as after her report of the abuse. Via\u2019s counsel argued this evidence would prove that L.V. had a motive to fabricate the complaint against Via. Specifically, it would lend support to Via\u2019s theory that L.V. fabricated the complaints against him with the intention of removing Via from the home, so that he could no longer restrict her from seeing her boyfriend.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">The trial court ruled as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-6\">All right Ms. Gartzke [ (Via\u2019s counsel) ], I don\u2019t think evidence about what type of sexual activity that this child, when she was five years old, engaged in with her father or the boyfriend of her mother, is relevant. And I think it violates the \u201cRape Shield Statute.\u201d I don\u2019t think it\u2019s relevant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-7\">Hi H* # ^ * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-8\">... If they ... try to make her prior sexual history an issue in this case \u2014 if the Commonwealth tries to do that \u2014 then, you know there isn\u2019t much left of this \u201cRape Shield Statute\u201d ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-9\">H: Hi Hi Hi ^ ^</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-10\">... [I]f that suggestion ever gets \u2014 gets in here ... what the child actually did would be admissible....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-11\">Now the report is \u2014 is something entirely different, for a different reason. The fact that she reported it and got what she wanted, or ... and I don\u2019t know what your evidence is going to be. And you\u2019re gonna [sic] have to put some evidence on that\u2019s going to make this admissible; the fact that she made a report and got this child \u2014 or these men excluded from her life, as a result of it, and she knows she can do that. It\u2019s all gonna [sic] depend on what kind of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>evidence you\u2019ve got, as to why would she want to do that in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-5\">:jc <em>* </em>*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-6\">All right. But I can\u2019t see how it\u2019s gonna [sic] be much voluminous evidence [sic], because you\u2019re not gonna [sic] get into evidence what all went on in Montgomery County. You\u2019re just not. It\u2019s not coming in. But the \u2014 the fact that the report \u2014 she made a report and what happened thereafter, may be admissible, provided you \u2014 you establish a relevance [sic].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-7\">^ sfc # <em>% </em>s}; }|i</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-8\">The [Rape Shield] statute does not apply to the incest charge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-9\">* * * * # *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-10\">With respect to the incest charge, there\u2019s very little that could conceivably be relevant to an incest charge about some this girl\u2019s prior sexual history or subsequent sexual history. It just wouldn\u2019t be relevant. It\u2019s a question of whether or not he had sex with her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-11\">So, you know, I want to caution you now____[J]ust don\u2019t have somebody come in here and blurt out something that you know is not relevant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b223-13\">In its written order of February 27, 2002, the trial court stated as follows, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-14\">2) The <em>Rape Shield Statute </em>(Sect.l8.20-67.7)[sie] does not apply to the charge of incest, but does apply to the charge of forcible sodomy; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-15\">3) Evidence about the sexual activities of [L.V.] which occurred in Montgomery County, Virginia before she was adopted, are not admissible.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b223-16\">At the beginning of Via\u2019s trial, the trial court gave the jury \u201cpreliminary instructions.\u201d Specifically, the trial court admonished the jury that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-17\">No statement, ruling, or remark that I may make at anytime during the course of this trial is intended in any way to indicate my opinion as to the facts of this case. No expres<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>sion, look, or gesture that I may make should be interpreted by you as being indicative of my opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">Subsequently, L.V. testified that the Vias adopted her when she was ten years of age. She stated she was 16 at the time of the trial. L.V. testified that, after living with the Vias for several months, Via began to nib her chest and her \u201cprivates\u201d when he would tuck her into bed at night. Sometime after that, Via began to sodomize L.V. and the two began engaging in oral sex and having intercourse.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">L.V. testified that these activities continued for the next few years, even after the family had moved into a new home. At that time, L.V. had her own bedroom in the basement of the home. L.V. contended that the last time she had intercourse with her father was on August 4, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">L.V. testified that she met with Dr. Conley and that she told him about the abuse. She conceded she told him that at times, after the abuse began, she would \u201cask [Via] for sex.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b224-8\">At one point during L.V.\u2019s cross-examination, Via\u2019s counsel attempted to admit a photograph of L.V.\u2019s bedroom into evidence. L.V. and her siblings appeared in the photograph. Without clearly setting forth the context, the record establishes that the trial court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-9\">I\u2019ll mark it, what is it, I\u2019ll mark it A, photograph, I\u2019ll mark it Defendant\u2019s Exhibit A for purposes of identification. Are you just going to go on off or you going to object to it?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-10\">Counsel for the Commonwealth replied, \u201cI\u2019m not going to object to that picture, no sir.\u201d The trial court then admitted the picture into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-11\">As Via\u2019s counsel attempted to admit other photographs, the following colloquy took place between counsel and the trial court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-12\">[Counsel for the Commonwealth]: Show them to [L.V.]. See what she\u2019ll say about them. Judge, I, I don\u2019t know what the relevance of these pictures are. She\u2019s not denying being happy. These are ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>[Trial Court]: I can understand that, Mr. Reed [(Counsel for the Commonwealth)], but you\u2019ve been sitting there for</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-5\">[Counsel for the Commonwealth]: Well, I, you know, I ... [Trial Court]: ... been going on and on, she\u2019s ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-6\">[Counsel for the Commonwealth]: ... I\u2019m trying to be accommodating but there are limits to how far we need to go.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-7\">[Trial Court]: Ms. Gartzke [(Via\u2019s counsel)], I\u2019m going to, if this, if this is what the purpose of these photographs is, I\u2019m going to sustain the objection because she\u2019s answered that, she answered that 15 minutes ago, said she was happy except when [sic]. And I, and she\u2019s testified it hadn\u2019t, her unhappiness never showed or came out and I just think that\u2019s far enough. I mean, that\u2019s enough.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-8\">[Counsel for Via]: Okay.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-9\">When asked whether she wrote about the abuse in her diary, L.V. stated that she remembered writing \u201cone thing.\u201d The Commonwealth then objected to the admission of L.V.\u2019s diaries based upon relevance, but noting that they may be admissible if Via\u2019s counsel were to ask L.V. \u201csomething specific.\u201d Outside of the presence of the jury, Via\u2019s counsel responded that the diaries should be admitted to show that L.V. did not write about the alleged abuse. Noting that L.V. had already admitted this, and stating, \u201cthis is so much overkill, it\u2019s pathetic,\u201d the trial court sustained the objection. The court further stated, \u201c[i]f there\u2019s anything important in there, ask her about it. Otherwise, it\u2019s just cumulative to the point of <em>ad nauseam.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b225-10\">After the jury returned, L.V. testified that she had a boyfriend, Isaiah, during the summer of 2001 and that she saw him three times that summer. L.V. agreed that she talked with Isaiah on the telephone for hours, that they had talked about getting married, and that they had discussed names for their future children. L.V. stated that she \u201chid\u201d her relationship with Isaiah from Via. L.V. further conceded that she was afraid Via would not approve of Isaiah.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>When Via\u2019s counsel asked L.V., \u201cYou never even gave him a chance to find out you had any kind of relation ...the Commonwealth objected, arguing that the question was \u201c[inJappropriate.\u201d The trial court stated \u201cMs. Gartzke, what\u2019s the purpose of that last question? The first one, fine, the second one, what\u2019s the purpose of it[?] Don\u2019t tell me. I\u2019m going to sustain the objection. Go ahead.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">On re-direct, L.V. stated she never spent time with Isaiah unchaperoned.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">On re-cross, Via\u2019s counsel attempted to introduce love notes written by L.V. and Isaiah, dated August 18, 2001 through September 5, 2001. After Via\u2019s counsel requested that they be marked, and again without clearly setting forth the context, the record reflects the trial court stated, \u201cWell, you should let her know of your objection.\u201d The Commonwealth then objected, arguing relevance, and the trial court sustained the objection. Via\u2019s counsel responded that the contents of the letters were \u201cabsolutely relevant.\u201d After cautioning Via\u2019s counsel not to \u201craise [her] voice,\u201d the trial court dismissed the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">Via\u2019s counsel argued that there was information in the letters that contradicted L.V.\u2019s statements that she \u201cwent out with [Isaiah] three times but she was never unchaperoned.\u201d When the trial court asked Via\u2019s counsel about the specific relevance of the letters, Via\u2019s counsel stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-8\">It\u2019s the crux of our whole case, Your Honor. He did not know about it but she testified that she was afraid to tell him about it and the contents of those letters back up that she was afraid to tell him because she had some total misconception that he would not allow her to see this boy and, and these charges are totally fabricated ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-9\">Although Via\u2019s counsel further claimed that the letters contained information concerning \u201cthings that occurred before August 18th,\u201d the trial court sustained the objection finding that \u201cnothing that occurred with this young woman and any young man after August 18th is relevant to any issue in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b227-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>Janet Flavin testified on behalf of the Commonwealth. Flavin stated that she was working as a child protective services worker with Staunton Augusta County Department of Social Services on August 18, 2001. She testified that she interviewed L.V. about her report of abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\">On cross-examination, Via\u2019s counsel attempted to ask Flavin whether she followed a training seminar manual when interviewing L.V. The Commonwealth objected to the introduction of the manual on the basis of relevance. Via\u2019s counsel stated that the manual was relevant because it \u201ccontain[ed] information about how a child should be interviewed when abuse or sexual abuse allegations are going to become criminal offenses\u201d and \u201cmuch of things in this book were not followed by [Flavin] when she initially interviewed [L .V.].\u201d The trial court sustained the Commonwealth\u2019s objection, finding that \u201c[w]hat this young woman has been taught to do with respect to investigations,\u201d was irrelevant. However, the trial court prompted Via\u2019s counsel to present any evidence she might have indicating that Flavin \u201ctold this victim to he or something of that nature.\u201d Via\u2019s counsel noted her exception, then proffered the training seminar manual for the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">At the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s case-in-chief, Via\u2019s counsel made a motion to strike and the trial court overruled the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">Paula Via testified on behalf of Via. When Via\u2019s counsel attempted to ask Paula about L.V.\u2019s disposition and demeanor when she first came to live with the Vias, the Commonwealth again objected on the basis of relevance. The trial court sustained the objection, finding the \u201chistory of the family simply isn\u2019t [relevant], if you\u2019ve got a single event or something of that nature that you want to poke us on that\u2019s fine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">Later, when Paula began to testify about the \u201cabuse that [L.V.] had been through in her life before she came to live with [them],\u201d the Commonwealth requested that Paula\u2019s remarks be stricken from the record. The trial court admonished the jury to disregard Paula\u2019s remarks in this regard, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>after asking the jury to retire to the jury room, reminded Via\u2019s counsel of his earlier ruling concerning L.V.\u2019s past abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">After the jury returned, Paula Via testified about several statements made by L.V. At that time, the Commonwealth objected, arguing that the testimony being .elicited was hearsay. The trial court stated, \u201cI wondered when you were going to ask,\u201d then sustained the objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">Via testified on his own behalf and denied having \u201csex with [his] daughter\u201d or \u201coral sex with [his] daughter.\u201d Via testified that L.V. was the one who had solicited him for sex. The remainder of Via\u2019s case-in-chief consisted, in large part, of testimony from several witnesses, offered for the purpose of establishing that L.V. had not complained to others of abuse and/or to serve as character witnesses for Via. One witness, Rochelle Glover, testified that she was a family friend. However, she also stated that she was a registered nurse, specializing in pediatric emergency medicine. After Glover testified that she \u201cdid\u201d most of the pediatric sexual assault cases when she worked in the \u201cemergency department,\u201d the trial court stated that \u201c[s]he better not\u201d \u201coffer any kind of opinion.\u201d Glover went on to testify that, although she spent time with L.V. \u201cmany times,\u201d L.V. never reported the abuse to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">Before resting his defense, Via\u2019s counsel proffered evidence for the record that the trial court had earlier ruled inadmissible. Via\u2019s counsel stated that there were two groups of evidence to proffer. The first group consisted of evidence concerning L.V.\u2019s relationship with Isaiah, which would be as follows: 1) A friend of L.V.\u2019s would testify that during the summer of 2001, L.V. told her she \u201ccouldn\u2019t believe [her] Dad\u201d would not let her \u201cgo out with Isaiah until [she was] older\u201d; 2) L.V.\u2019s maternal grandmother would testify that L.V. spoke with her that summer, on more than one occasion, about \u201cseeing\u201d Isaiah before July 2001; 3) Via\u2019s brother would testify that he had, on several occasions that summer, seen a silver pickup truck, similar to that driven by Isaiah\u2019s brother, parked near the Via home, as well as the horse farm where L.V. rode horses; and 4) L.V.\u2019s paternal grandfather would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>testify that he had found the outside light near the entrance to the Via basement (where L.V.\u2019s bedroom was located) disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">Via\u2019s counsel proffered that the second category of evidence concerned L.V\u2019s prior sexual abuse which occurred in Montgomery County. Relevant to this appeal, Via\u2019s counsel proffered testimony from a foster parent L.V. had lived with in Montgomery County, before she lived with the Vias. Via\u2019s counsel stated that the foster parent would testify that L.V. told her, in 1993, that she did not want to go home because her birth mother\u2019s boyfriend had sexually abused her. Via\u2019s counsel proffered that a Montgomery County social worker would testify that this report came just after L.V. was informed she would be returned to her mother\u2019s home. Further, when L.V. was told she might then be returned to her birth father\u2019s home, she reported that he had done \u201cthe same things to her\u201d and \u201cwent beyond,\u201d claiming that her birth father \u201chad taken his clothes off, laid on top of her and fondled her.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">Following the proffer, the trial court confirmed its earlier rulings, finding the evidence, \u201cto the extent it allege[d] the child had sexual activity to \u2014 violate the Rape Shield Statute with respect to the sodomy charge.... And, more importantly, this Romeo and Juliet theory never got anywhere. It never got off the ground.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">At the close of the evidence, the trial court prompted Via\u2019s counsel to renew her motion to strike, which she did. The trial court then denied the motion. The jury subsequently found Via guilty of both charges and recommended that he be sentenced to serve five years in prison on each charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">Thereafter, Via\u2019s counsel filed a motion to set aside the verdict arguing, in relevant part, that the trial court erred in refusing to quash the Commonwealth\u2019s subpoena <em>duces tecum, </em>requesting records from Dr. Conley, and in refusing to admit the evidence proffered by the defense. The trial court denied the motion and sentenced Via in accordance with the jury\u2019s recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>II. <em>Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">Via asserts several Questions Presented on appeal. We find no merit in any of Via\u2019s contentions and for the following reasons, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">Via first argues that the trial court erred \u201cby prompting and soliciting evidentiary objections from the Commonwealth in front of the jury and by berating and belittling defense counsel in her efforts to present proper defense evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ACT\">Via accurately points out that, in Virginia,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-8\">[w]e have repeatedly held that in the trial of a criminal case it is of great importance that the court leave to the jury, exclusively, the consideration of the facts. [Indeed,] [i]n <em>Parsons v. Commonwealth, </em>154 Va. 832, 152 S.E. 547 [(1930)], it was said: \u201cTrial judges in Virginia do not sit merely to keep order. They must do whatever seems to be necessary to mete out evenhanded justice both to the Commonwealth and to the accused, and they should with care abstain from conduct which tends to indicate to the jury any opinion upon those facts, which it is their, and not his, duty to pass upon.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b230-9\"><em>Johnson v. Commonwealth, </em>193 Va. 502, 505, 69 S.E.2d 340, 341 (1952). However, the Supreme Court of Virginia has explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-10\">[p]atience is a virtue that well adorns a judge, adds to his respect from bar and public, and aids in creating an atmosphere becoming to a forum where [people] bring their disputes for judicial determination. But, as we said in <em>[Parsons </em>, while impatience is regrettable, judges continue to be [human] and do not cast aside all human imperfections when they ascend the bench. To warrant reversal, their error must be more than mere impatience; it must be of such character as to result in prejudice and prevent a fair trial. It would be that kind, of course, if it caused the jury to become prejudiced against the accused, or influenced them in weighing the evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b231-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number><em>Moore v. Commonwealth, </em>186 Va. 453, 463, 42 S.E.2d 871, 876 (1947).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\">Via specifically complains about the trial court\u2019s statements \u201cthis is so much overkill, it\u2019s pathetic,\u201d and \u201cit\u2019s cumulative to the point of <em>ad nauseum.\u201d </em>Nevertheless, contrary to Via\u2019s contention otherwise, these statements were not made in front of the jury. Thus, they could not have improperly \u201cprejudiced\u201d or \u201cinfluenced\u201d the jury. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">Via next points to two occasions where he contends that the trial court solicited the Commonwealth\u2019s objections to evidence. In particular, the family photographs and the love letters between Isaiah and L.V. Via also points to the trial court\u2019s statement, concerning a defense witness who was a \u201cregistered nurse specializing in pediatric emergency medicine,\u201d that \u201c[s]he better not offer an opinion.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">After a careful review of the record, however, we do not find such instances constitute an expression of the trial court\u2019s opinion of the evidence, nor do we find from this record that the trial court\u2019s actions improperly prejudiced or influenced the jury. When considered in the appropriate context, it is clear that the trial court\u2019s statements or \u201csolicited\u201d objections did not bear on the validity of the evidence being offered in any manner. Moreover, the trial court\u2019s statement concerning the opinion evidence appeared to be merely the court\u2019s attempt to remind counsel of his earlier rulings in this regard and/or recognition that Via\u2019s counsel had failed to lay a proper foundation for expert testimony from that particular witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">Virginia courts have consistently held that \u201c[t]he conduct of a trial is committed to the sound discretion of the trial court.\u201d <em>Justus v. Commonwealth, </em>222 Va. 667, 676, 283 S.E.2d 905, 910 (1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>455 U.S. 983, 102 S.Ct. 1491, 71 L.Ed.2d 693 (1982); <em>Cunningham v. Commonwealth, </em>2 Va.App. 358, 365, 344 S.E.2d 389, 393 (1986). Indeed,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>[c]ases should not be reversed merely because the judge was impatient, or because he of his own motion ruled out improper testimony and objected to unnecessary repetition; even tilts with counsel are not sufficient. No trial is perfect, and error will at times creep in, particularly in hotly contested cases. To warrant a reversal [the error] must be substantial; otherwise litigation would be interminable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b232-5\"><em>Parsons, </em>154 Va. at 852-53, 152 S.E. at 554.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">We find no such substantial prejudice here, nor has Via alleged any specific prejudice. Instead, Via states that the \u201ccollective impact\u201d of the trial court\u2019s conduct \u201ccannot be ignored.\u201d However, when we review the record as a whole and consider the trial court\u2019s statements in their proper context, it is clear that the trial court, while obviously impatient and abrupt on occasions, was equally so with both parties. Moreover, the trial court specifically instructed the jury, <em>at the beginning of the trial, </em>that his comments and demeanor should not be interpreted as indicative of his opinion. While we do not condone certain comments and the occasional lapse in the judicial demeanor of the trial court, we find no evidence of substantial bias on the part of the judge. Accordingly, we decline to reverse on this ground. <em>See Cunningham, </em>2 Va.App. at 365, 344 S.E.2d at 393 (\u201cThis court has no duty to deduce bias from the record.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">Via next argues the trial court erred in refusing to admit evidence that L.V. had engaged in a much more involved relationship with Isaiah than she claimed in her testimony. Specifically, for purposes of impeachment, Via contends the trial court should have admitted L.V.\u2019s diaries, the love letters between L.V. and Isaiah, the testimony proffered that L.V. had been \u201cseeing\u201d Isaiah before July of 2001, that his car had been seen near the home and horse farm, that the basement entrance light had been disabled, and that L .V. was concerned Via would not let her \u201cgo out with\u201d Isaiah, as well as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>the testimony proffered concerning L.V.\u2019s prior reports of abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">Via also argues the trial court erred in refusing to admit evidence of L.V.\u2019s behavior and statements after August 18, 2001, in refusing to admit testimony concerning L.V.\u2019s demeanor and emotional state when she first came to live with the Vias, and refusing to allow him to cross-examine Flavin \u201cas to her method of interviewing complainant and how it was contrary to her training and could have tainted the interview by coaching and supplying details.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">It is, of course, fundamental that the Commonwealth had the burden of proving each element of its case, <em>Martin v. Commonwealth, </em>13 Va.App. 524, 529, 414 S.E.2d 401, 403 (1992) <em>(en </em>banc), and Via had the \u201cright to call for evidence\u201d in his favor, <em>see </em>Va. Const, art I, \u00a7 8A. However, it is well settled that \u201c[t]he admissibility of evidence is within the broad discretion of the trial court, and a ruling will not be disturbed on appeal in the absence of an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>James v. Commonwealth, </em>18 Va.App. 746, 753, 446 S.E.2d 900, 904 (1994). Generally speaking, \u201c[e]vidence is admissible if it is both relevant and material,\u201d and it is inadmissible if it fails to satisfy these criteria. <em>Evans-Smith v. Commonwealth, </em>5 Va.App. 188, 196, 198, 361 S.E.2d 436, 441, 442 (1987). \u201cEvidence is relevant if it has any logical tendency, however slight, to establish a fact at issue in the case.\u201d <em>Ragland v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 913, 918, 434 S.E.2d 675, 678 (1993). \u201cEvidence is material if it relates to a matter properly at issue.\u201d <em>Evans-Smith, </em>5 Va.App. at 196, 361 S.E.2d at 441.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A4v\">When a witness takes the stand, she puts her credibility at issue in the case. <em>See Smith v. Commonwealth, </em>212 Va. 675, 676, 187 S.E.2d 191, 192 (1972). Thus, the opposing party may impeach the witness by \u201cdraw[ing] into question the accuracy of the witness\u2019s perception, recordation, recollection, narration, or sincerity.\u201d Strong, <em>1 McCormick on Evidence, </em>\u00a7 33 n. 5, at 123 (5th ed.1999) (citations omitted). \u201cAny evidence which would tend to convince the jury that the witness\u2019s perception, memory, or narration is defective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>or that his or her veracity is questionable is relevant for purposes of impeachment.\u201d Friend, <em>Law of Evidence in Virginia, </em>\u00a7 4-1, at 101 (5th ed.1993).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b234-5\"><em>McCarter v. Commonwealth, </em>38 Va.App. 502, 506, 566 S.E.2d 868, 869-70 (2002) (other citations omitted). Considering these rules, we find no error in the trial court\u2019s determination to exclude the evidence recited above.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">First, with regard to L.V.\u2019s diaries, as the trial court noted, L .V. conceded that she had only written about the abuse on one occasion. Accordingly, any evidence concerning a lack of writings in the diaries would have been cumulative and clearly irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">With regard to the love letters, we note that Via\u2019s defense theory was that L.V. fabricated the charges against Via in order to get him removed from the home, so that he could not interfere with her relationship with Isaiah. However, as noted by the trial court, the letters were composed after L.V. lodged the complaint. Furthermore, Via\u2019s basis for introducing the letters was his contention that the letters proved L.V. feared Via would not allow her to see Isaiah and \u201ctotally contradicted\u201d L.V.\u2019s testimony that \u201cshe went out with [Isaiah] three times but was never unchaperoned.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">Even assuming Via\u2019s contentions are true, L.V. conceded in her testimony that she was afraid Via would not approve of her relationship with Isaiah. Furthermore, although Via\u2019s counsel proffered the love letters for the record, she never identified or proffered any statements in the letters which contradicted L.V.\u2019s testimony, nor did she bring the letters to L.V.\u2019s attention or lay any foundation for introduction of the letters as prior inconsistent statements. <em>See </em>Friend, <em>Law of Evidence in Virginia, </em>\u00a7 4-5(a), at 119 (5th ed. 1999) (\u201c[T]he prior inconsistent statements must in fact be inconsistent with or contradictory to the present testimony and must have emanated from the witness himself.\u201d); <em>McCarter, </em>38 Va.App. at 506, 566 S.E.2d at 869-70; <em>see also Adams v. Ristine, </em>138 Va. 273, 293, 122 S.E. 126, 132 (1924) (\u201cIt is well settled that if it is intended to impeach a witness by a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>prior inconsistent statement, the foundation should be laid by first calling the attention of the witness to the alleged inconsistent statement and enquiring whether he made it.\u201d); <em>Fisher v. Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 788, 794, 497 S.E.2d 162, 165 (1998) (\u201cWhen defendant\u2019s counsel failed to cross-examine [the witness] relative to the alleged inconsistent statements ... he failed to lay a proper foundation necessary to impeach [the witness] through testimony regarding such statements.\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Accordingly, we find no abuse of discretion on the part of the trial court in refusing to admit this evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">Turning to the statements pertaining to L.V.\u2019s concern that Via would not let her date Isaiah until she was older, her statements that she had \u201cseen\u201d Isaiah prior to July of 2001, as well as the statements concerning the observation of a silver pickup truck and the disabled light, we find that this proffered testimony was irrelevant, cumulative and/or collateral to any issue in the case and, therefore, properly excluded. Indeed, L.V. conceded that she was afraid Via would not approve of her relationship with Isaiah. L V. also conceded that she \u201csaw\u201d Isaiah on three occasions. She did not testify to the dates of those occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">Further, the evidence concerning the silver pickup truck and the disabled light was, at best, collateral to the issues in this case.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-7\">A fact is wholly collateral to the main issue if the fact cannot be used in evidence for any purpose other than for contradiction. Evidence of collateral facts, from which no fair <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>inferences can be drawn tending to throw light upon the particular fact under investigation, is properly excluded for the reason that such evidence tends to draw the minds of the jury away from the point in issue, to excite prejudice and mislead them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b236-5\"><em>Helmick v. Commonwealth, </em>38 Va.App. 558, 564-65, 567 S.E.2d 551, 554-55 (2002); <em>see also PTS Corp. v. Buckman, </em>263 Va. 613, 621, 561 S.E.2d 718, 722 (2002) (\u201cThe determination that proffered evidence is collateral, is, in essence, a determination of relevance.\u201d); <em>see also Coe v. Commonwealth, </em>231 Va. 83, 87, 340 S.E.2d 820, 823 (1986). Moreover, none of this particular testimony directly contradicted L.V.\u2019s testimony or version of the relevant events. Thus, we find no error in the trial court\u2019s determination that this evidence was irrelevant and immaterial and therefore, inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">We likewise find no merit in Via\u2019s contention that the trial court improperly refused to admit evidence of L.V.\u2019s \u201cbehavior, statements and events after August 18, 2001,\u201d as well as her demeanor and emotional state when she first came to live with the Vias, nearly six years prior to the trial. As stated above, it is most certainly within the discretion of the trial court to exclude evidence which is not relevant or material to any matter properly at issue in the case. <em>Helmick, </em>38 Va.App. at 564-65, 567 S.E.2d at 554-55; <em>Evans-Smith, </em>5 Va.App. at 196, 361 S.E.2d at 441. We find no reason to hold that such evidence was relevant in terms of the disputed issues in the case, nor in terms of L.V.\u2019s credibility as a witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">Finally, we find no error in the trial court\u2019s decision to preclude testimony concerning Flavin\u2019s interview techniques as they related to the seminar training manual produced by Via. Via proffered no evidence, nor even a mere allegation, that Flavin engaged in any improper conduct when questioning L.V. Accordingly, the trial court\u2019s determination that the manual was irrelevant was not tantamount to an abuse of discretion. We thus affirm Via\u2019s convictions on these grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>C.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">Via next contends the trial court erred in refusing to admit evidence concerning L.V.\u2019s prior reports of sexual abuse, by \u201cincorrectly applying the \u2018Rape Shield Statute.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">Code \u00a7 18.2-67.7, referred to as the \u201crape shield\u201d law, excludes evidence in sexual assault cases,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AEH\">of the \u201cgeneral reputation ... of the complaining witness\u2019s unchaste character or prior sexual conduct\u201d ... [which is] defined as \u201cany sexual conduct on the part of the complaining witness which took place before the conclusion of the trial, excluding the conduct involved in the offense alleged under this article.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b237-7\"><em>Clinebell v. Commonwealth, </em>235 Va. 319, 322, 368 S.E.2d 263, 264 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b237-8\">Here, on the basis of the rape shield law, the trial court specifically refused to allow evidence \u201cto the extent it alleges the child had sexual activity\u201d and only with respect to the sodomy charge. Indeed, in its written order, the trial court specifically stated</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-9\">2) The <em>Rape Shield Statute </em>(Sect.l8.20-67.7)[sic] does not apply to the charge of incest, but does apply to the charge of forcible sodomy; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-10\">3) Evidence about the <em>sexual activities </em>of [L.V.] which occurred in Montgomery County, Virginia before she was adopted, are not admissible.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b237-11\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b237-12\">Via contends that the trial court erred in applying the rape shield law to preclude evidence concerning L.V.\u2019s prior reports of abuse. We need not reach the merits of Via\u2019s claim in this regard. Via simply misapprehends the trial court\u2019s ruling. In fact, the record reflects that the trial court ruled that any \u201creports\u201d of sexual abuse would not be barred from admission, as long as Via laid the proper foundation. Specifically, the court stated, \u201cthe fact that the report \u2014 she made a report and what happened thereafter, may be admissible, provided you\u2014 you establish a relevance [sic].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>Via attempted to admit no such evidence, nor did Via attempt to lay the proper foundation for such evidence. <em>See </em>Clinebell, 235 Va. at 325, 368 S.E.2d at 266 (\u201cA complaining witness\u2019 prior accusations are admissible, however, only if a court makes a threshold determination that a reasonable probability of falsity exists.\u201d). Indeed, the record reflects that Via\u2019s counsel abandoned any attempt to offer such evidence. Accordingly, we find no abuse of discretion and we affirm the trial court on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">Finally, Via argues the trial court erred in refusing to quash the Commonwealth\u2019s subpoena <em>duces tecum </em>seeking records in possession of Dr. Conley as they related to statements made by Via, his wife, and L.V.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">As stated above, Via asserts that he hired Dr. Conley \u201c[a]s a part of [his] preparation of the defense of these charges\u201d \u201cto assist in evaluating the complainant, suggest defense theories and method of presentations of those theories at trial.\u201d Thus, Via contends Dr. Conley\u2019s records were protected by the attorney/client privilege and constituted attorney work product. Via further contends that the Commonwealth\u2019s request for the documents equated to an \u201ceffort to circumvent Rule 3A:11.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">There can be no doubt that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AbM\">[confidential communications between attorney and client made because of that relationship and concerning the subject matter of the attorney\u2019s employment \u201care privileged from disclosure, even for the purpose of administering justice.\u201d <em>Grant v. Harris, </em>116 Va. 642, 648, 82 S.E. 718, 719 (1914); <em>accord Seventh District Committee v. Gunter, </em>212 Va. 278, 287, 183 S.E.2d 713, 719 (1971).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b238-9\"><em>Commonwealth v. Edwards, </em>235 Va. 499, 508-09, 370 S.E.2d 296, 301 (1988). \u201cThe privilege attaches to communications of the client made to the attorney\u2019s agents ... when such agent\u2019s services are indispensable to the attorney\u2019s effective representation of the client.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cNevertheless, the privilege is an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>exception to the general duty to disclose, is an obstacle to investigation of the truth, and should be strictly construed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>And \u201c[t]he party seeking to assert the attorney-client privilege bears the burden of persuasion on the issue.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 509, 370 S.E.2d at 301.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">In this case, Via proffered no evidence for the record in any effort to establish the \u201cindispensability\u201d of Dr. Conley\u2019s services. Thus, there was simply no reason for the trial court to have declared Dr. Conley an \u201cagent\u201d of Via\u2019s counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">As we have found no evidence in the record to support Via\u2019s theory that Dr. Conley was an \u201cagent\u201d of his counsel, we find no reason to reverse the trial court\u2019s ruling that Dr. Conley\u2019s records did not qualify as his attorney\u2019s \u201cwork product.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">Finally, there is no issue here of the proper application of Rule 3A:11. Rule 3A:11 provides that when <em>a defendant </em>seeks certain discovery from <em>the Commonwealth, </em>a trial court may condition such discovery upon the Commonwealth receiving certain specified reciprocal discovery from the defendant. <em>See </em>Rule 3A:11. The discovery made available to the Commonwealth is limited to \u201cwritten reports of autopsy examinations, ballistic tests, fingerprint, blood, urine and breath analyses, and other scientific tests that may be within the accused\u2019s possession....\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">The subpoena here, however, did not seek production of documents in Via\u2019s possession, but documents in the possession of Dr. Conley \u2014 a third party. Because we have found that the record belies Via\u2019s assertion that Dr. Conley was an agent of his counsel for purposes of the litigation at issue, we find no error in the trial court\u2019s refusal to quash the Commonwealth\u2019s subpoena <em>duces tecum </em>pursuant to Rule 3A:11.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Indeed, \u201c[i]n a criminal proceeding, either the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>dant or the Commonwealth may apply for a subpoena to obtain writings and objects that are material to the proceedings and in the possession of a third party.\u201d <em>Gibbs v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 697, 699, 432 S.E.2d 514, 515 (1993). \u201cThe scope of a subpoena <em>duces tecum </em>is not limited to those objects or documents that may be used at trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Rather, such a subpoena may be obtained where there is a \u201c \u2018substantial basis for claiming\u2019 that the documents or objects sought were material.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">For the above-stated reasons, we affirm Via\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b220-8\">.

During the hearing, Via's counsel also indicated that she was considering producing expert testimony from a psychologist in order to establish that \"there is a psychological condition in which children who are adopted at that older age, end up \u2014 a high proportion of those children end up making sexual abuse complaints against their foster parents or their adopted [sic] parents.\u201d The trial court advised Via's counsel that it considered such evidence to be pertinent to the credibility of the witness, a matter that it explained was within the province of the jury. It encouraged Via\u2019s counsel to produce authority for her position, but advised that it did not \"believe\u201d expert testimony concerning an opinion of a witness\u2019 credibility would be admissible.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b231-8\">.
