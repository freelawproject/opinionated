On appeal, J.D. challenges the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress incriminating statements. J.D. contends his statements, which he made in the office of his school\u2019s assistant principal, were admitted in violation of the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966), and that the statements were compelled and involuntary in violation of his Fifth Amendment rights. Finding no error in the trial court\u2019s denial of the motion to suppress, we affirm J.D.\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">\n<em>FACTS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">In reviewing a trial court\u2019s ruling on a motion to suppress, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party, and consider the \u201cevidence adduced at both the trial and suppression hearing.\u201d <em>Greene v. Commonwealth, </em>17 Va.App. 606, 608, 440 S.E.2d 138,139 (1994). <em>See Spivey v. Commonwealth, </em>23 Va.App. 715, 721, 479 S.E.2d 543, 546 (1997). \u201c \u2018The burden is upon [the defendant] to show that th[e] ruling, when the evidence is considered most favorably to the Commonwealth, constituted reversible error.\u2019 \u201d <em>McGee v. Commonwealth, </em>25 Va.App. 193, 197, 487 S.E.2d 259, 261 (1997) <em>(en </em>banc) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">In May of 2001, J.D. was a fourteen-year-old student at Albemarle High School, where his father was a teacher. A series of thefts had occurred at the school during that month. School authorities identified J.D. and three other students as suspects in a theft that had occurred during the latter part of the month.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-9\">At about 2:30 p.m. on May 25, 2001, Steven Wright, an associate principal at the school, summoned J.D. to his office and questioned him about the most recent theft. In addition, Lawrence Lawill, the principal at Albemarle High School, was present during portions of Wright\u2019s questioning of J.D. The record does not indicate that Lawill participated in the interview. Officer Stuart Snead, the school resource police officer, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>was present while Wright conducted the interview of J.D. The officer was silent during the interview. He did not instruct Wright about questioning J.D. He and Wright had no prior discussions about potential criminal charges against J.D.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">During the interview, J.D. was not told he could not leave the office nor was he restrained in any way. Wright told J.D. to tell what, if anything, he knew about the thefts. J.D. made oral and written statements acknowledging his involvement in the theft of a video camera that was school property. He then assisted Wright in the recovery of the camera.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">J.D.\u2019s father joined Wright and J.D. in Wright\u2019s office at about 4:45 p.m., after the school day had ended. Wright explained that he was investigating the theft of property at the school and showed J.D.\u2019s father the merchandise J.D. had helped to recover. J.D.\u2019s father instructed J.D. to tell him the truth about what had happened. J.D.\u2019s subsequent statements were consistent with those he made before his father came to Wright\u2019s office.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">On cross-examination Wright testified that a student can be disciplined for refusing to obey an assistant principal at Albemarle High School. The punishment imposed in such a situation would depend upon the circumstances. Wright also indicated that he had no way to require or force a student to talk. J.D. testified he believed he had no option but to report to Wright\u2019s office and to cooperate because \u201cif you don\u2019t do it you suffer different consequences from detention to suspension.\u201d J.D. offered no further testimony regarding the content or circumstances of his conversation with Wright.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">\n<em>MIRANDA ANALYSIS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b383-9\">J.D. argues that the admission of his statement violated the principles announced in <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966). In <em>Miranda, </em>the Supreme Court of the United States</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-10\">concluded that the coercion inherent in custodial interrogation blurs the line between voluntary and involuntary statements, and thus heightens the risk that an individual will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>not be \u201caccorded his privilege under the Fifth Amendment ... not to be compelled to incriminate himself.\u201d Accordingly, [the Court] laid down \u201cconcrete constitutional guidelines for law enforcement agencies and courts to follow.\u201d Those guidelines established that the admissibility in evidence of any statement given during custodial interrogation of a suspect would depend on whether the police provided the suspect with four warnings. These warnings (which have come to be known colloquially as <em>\u201cMiranda </em>rights\u201d) are: a suspect \u201chas the right to remain silent, that anything he says can be used against him in a court of law, that he has the right to the presence of an attorney, and that if he cannot afford an attorney one will be appointed for him prior to any questioning if he so desires.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-5\"><em>Dickerson v. United States, </em>530 U.S. 428, 435, 120 S.Ct. 2326, 2330, 147 L.Ed.2d 405 (2000) (quoting <em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 439, 442, and 479, 86 S.Ct. at 1609, 1611, and 1630). Fundamentally, the <em>Miranda </em>rule \u201cdoes not apply outside the context of the inherently coercive custodial interrogations for which it was designed.\u201d <em>Roberts v. United States, </em>445 U.S. 552, 560, 100 S.Ct. 1358, 1360, 63 L.Ed.2d 622 (1980). The <em>Miranda </em>guidelines are</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-6\">directed toward police conduct.... \u201cThe duty of giving <em>Miranda </em>warnings\u2019 is limited to employees of governmental agencies <em>whose function is to enforce the law, </em>or to those acting for such law enforcement agencies by direction of the agencies; ... it does not include private citizens not directed or controlled by a law enforcement agency, even though their efforts might aid in law enforcement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-7\"><em>Mier v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 827, 830, 407 S.E.2d 342, 344 (1991) (emphasis added) (citation omitted) (concluding that a private security officer\u2019s failure to give <em>Miranda </em>warnings before questioning a shoplifter did not render the suspect\u2019s statement inadmissible). <em>But see Estelle v. Smith, </em>451 U.S. 454, 463-65, 101 S.Ct. 1866, 1873-74, 68 L.Ed.2d 359 (1981) (to be admissible against defendant at the penalty phase of capital murder trial, defendant\u2019s statements to court-appointed psychiatrist must have been preceded by <em>Miranda </em>warnings); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number><em>Mathis v. United States, </em>391 U.S. 1, 3-5, 88 S.Ct. 1503, 1504-05 20 L.Ed.2d 381 (1968) (Internal Revenue Service investigator was required to advise defendant, then in prison for other offenses, of his <em>Miranda </em>rights before questioning him about instances of tax fraud).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">Steven Wright, in questioning J.D., was not acting as a police officer or as a governmental agent with law enforcement authority. Numerous appellate courts from other states have concluded that a school principal or other school official who questions a student about a possible violation of law or school regulation does not, absent other circumstances, act as a law enforcement officer or agent of the state with law enforcement authority. <em>See, e.g., In re Navajo County Juvenile Action No. JV91000058, </em>183 Ariz. 204, 901 P.2d 1247, 1249 (Ct.App.1995); <em>In re Corey L., </em>203 Cal.App.3d 1020, 250 Cal.Rptr. 359, 361 (1988); <em>S.A. v. State, </em>654 N.E.2d 791, 797 (Ind.Ct.App.1995); <em>Commonwealth v. Snyder, </em>413 Mass. 521, 597 N.E.2d 1363, 1369 (1992); <em>State v. Tinkham, </em>143 N.H. 73, 719 A.2d 580, 583-84 (1998); <em>State v. Biancamano, </em>284 N.J.Super. 654, 666 A.2d 199, 203 (Ct.App.Div.1995); <em>In re Harold S., </em>731 A.2d 265, 268 (R.I.1999); <em>In re V.P., </em>55 S.W.3d 25, 33 (Tex.App.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">J.D. cites several out-of-state cases for the proposition that a school official is required to give a student <em>Miranda </em>warnings prior to questioning if any resulting statement is to be admissible in a criminal proceeding. <em>See In re: Jorge D., </em>202 Ariz. 277, 43 P.3d 605 (Ct.App.2002); <em>State v. John Doe, </em>130 Idaho 811, 948 P.2d 166 (Ct.App.1997); <em>State v. Killitz, </em>59 Or.App. 720, 651 P.2d 1382 (1982); <em>State v. D.R., </em>84 Wash. App. 832, 930 P.2d 350 (1997). In each of these cases, however, it was a police or security officer who interviewed the student, not a principal or other school official.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>We agree with the weight of authority and conclude that Wright was not a law enforcement officer, nor was he acting as an agent of a law enforcement governmental agency, when he interviewed J.D. Wright did not act at the direction of the police. In the course of his duties as assistant principal, Wright initiated and conducted the investigation regarding the recent thefts at the school. Although Wright had Snead present at the interview, Snead did not participate. Snead offered Wright no advice about how to conduct the questioning or what to do with the information Wright might obtain.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">As the Supreme Court of New Hampshire has observed,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AsB\">[although school principals are \u201cresponsible for administration and discipline within the school,\u201d and \u201cmust regularly conduct inquiries concerning both violations of school rules and violations of law,\u201d they are not law enforcement agents. They are \u201cneither trained nor equipped to conduct police investigations,\u201d and, unlike law enforcement agents, enforcing the law is not their primary mission. \u201cLaw enforcement officers are responsible for the investigation of criminal matters and maintenance of general public order,\u201d while school officials, in comparison, \u201care charged with fostering a safe and healthy educational environment that facilitates learning and promotes responsible citizenship.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ATW\"><em>Tinkham, </em>719 A.2d at 583 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">Additionally, the <em>Miranda </em>holding applies only when the suspect is in custody. <em>See Bosworth v. Commonwealth, </em>7 Va.App. 567, 572, 375 S.E.2d 756, 759 (1989). \u2018Whether a suspect is \u2018in custody' under <em>Miranda </em>is determined by the circumstances of each case, and \u2018the ultimate inquiry is simply whether there is a \u201cformal arrest or restraint on freedom of movement\u201d of the degree associated with formal arrest.\u2019 \u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number><em>Ford v. Commonwealth, </em>28 Va.App. 249, 256, 503 S.E.2d 803, 806 (1998) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">J.D. was not \u201cin custody\u201d for <em>Miranda </em>purposes at the time Wright interviewed him. J.D. was not restrained during the meeting, which took place in Wright\u2019s office. Wright did not indicate that J.D. was under arrest or was subject to arrest in the future. While the security officer was present in the room, he made no show of authority suggesting that J.D. was under arrest or not free to leave. Snead\u2019s mere presence during Wright\u2019s questioning did not convert the questioning into a custodial interrogation by a law enforcement officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">In <em>In re Drolshagen, </em>280 S.C. 84, 310 S.E.2d 927 (1984), a student was asked to report to the office of his school principal, where school officials questioned the student. Police officers were present in the school office, but did not participate in the interview. The South Carolina Supreme Court found the holding in <em>Miranda </em>inapplicable, stating that \u201c[mjerely because the questioning took place in the principal\u2019s office, in the presence of police officers, \u2018did not render it a \u201ccustodial interrogation.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 927 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">Because J.D. was not \u201cin custody\u201d when Wright questioned him and because Wright was not a law enforcement officer or state officer acting in that capacity, <em>Miranda </em>has no application here. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in finding that <em>Miranda </em>did not require the exclusion of J.D.\u2019s statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">J.D. argues, in the alternative, that even if the <em>Miranda </em>holding does not govern the admissibility of his statement, we should adopt a state exclusionary rule in order to encourage cooperation between school officials and students in enforcing school policy. J.D. asserts that to permit the use of such statements in criminal proceedings will have a \u201cchilling effect\u201d upon the spirit of cooperation and free exchange of information between students and school authorities, an undesirable result from the perspective of both the criminal justice system and society in general. J.D. concedes that such statements could be used for school disciplinary purposes but not in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>subsequent criminal prosecutions. He argues that to do otherwise will result in a policy where students will be advised not to cooperate with school investigations, which J.D. says is an undesirable result.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">We decline J.D.\u2019s invitation to extend the exclusionary rule in order to encourage cooperation between students and school officials investigating criminal conduct. Such policy arguments are more appropriately addressed to the legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">\n<em>VOLUNTARINESS OF STATEMENT</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">J.D. also challenges the voluntariness of his statements to Wright. In determining whether a statement was made voluntarily,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-8\">\u201c[w]e must [independently] determine whether, in light of the totality of the circumstances, including not only the details of the interrogation, but also the characteristics of the accused, the statement was the product of an essentially free and unconstrained choice by its maker, or whether the maker\u2019s will was overcome and his capacity for self-determination critically impaired.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b388-9\"><em>Novak v. Commonwealth, </em>20 Va.App. 373, 386-87, 457 S.E.2d 402, 408 (1995) (citation omitted). The voluntariness issue is a question of law requiring an independent determination on appeal. <em>See Wilson v. Commonwealth, </em>13 Va.App. 549, 551, 413 S.E.2d 655, 656 (1992). In making that independent determination, however, \u201cwe are bound by the trial court\u2019s subsidiary factual findings unless those findings are plainly wrong.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b388-10\">Relating to the voluntariness of a suspect\u2019s statement, the Supreme Court has held that evidence of police activity \u201cis a necessary predicate to the finding that a confession is not \u2018voluntary\u2019 within the meaning of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d <em>Colorado v. Connelly, </em>479 U.S. 157, 167, 107 S.Ct. 515, 522, 93 L.Ed.2d 473 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>No evidence suggests J.D. was compelled to confess. Wright made no threats and used no force or intimidation to compel J.D. to make his admissions against his free will. We are not persuaded by appellant\u2019s contention that he was coerced into confessing by the mere possibility that he could be punished if he did not remain in Wright\u2019s office and answer his questions. In the absence of evidence of governmental coercion or compulsion, we do not disturb the trial court\u2019s conclusion that J.D.\u2019s statements were voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">\n<em>FIFTH AMENDMENT ANALYSIS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">The Fifth Amendment, which was made applicable to the States by the Fourteenth Amendment, <em>Malloy v. Hogan, </em>378 U.S. 1, 6, 84 S.Ct. 1489, 1493, 12 L.Ed.2d 653 (1964), requires that \u201c[n]o person ... shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.\u201d U.S. Const, amend. V. \u201cThe essence of this basic constitutional principle is \u2018the requirement that the State which proposes to convict ... an individual produce the evidence against him by the independent labor of its officers, not by the simple, cruel expedient of forcing it from his own lips.\u2019 \u201d <em>Estelle, </em>451 U.S. at 462, 101 S.Ct. at 1872 (citation omitted). Not only does the Fifth Amendment establish a person\u2019s right not to testify when one is a defendant in a criminal trial but also \u201cprivileges him not to answer official questions put to him in any other proceeding, civil or criminal, formal or informal, where the answers might incriminate him in future criminal proceedings.\u201d <em>Lefkowitz v. Turley, </em>414 U.S. 70, 77, 94 S.Ct. 316, 322, 38 L.Ed.2d 274 (1973). J.D. contends his privilege against seE-incrimination was violated because he was ordered to Wright\u2019s office and then compelled to confess or be punished.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">J.D. relies primarily upon the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Garrity v. New Jersey, </em>385 U.S. 493, 87 S.Ct. 616, 17 L.Ed.2d 562 (1967), in which New Jersey pohce officers were questioned during an official investigation of allegations of fraudulent conduct. Before the questioning, the officers were advised of their rights under <em>Miranda </em>not to answer questions, but were informed that any refusal to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>answer would result in their removal from office. <em>See id. </em>at 494, 87 S.Ct. at 617. Inculpatory statements from some of the officers were later admitted in criminal prosecutions against them. <em>See id. </em>at 495, 87 S.Ct. at 617-18. The Court concluded that the Fifth Amendment privilege against coerced statements \u201cprohibits use in subsequent criminal proceedings of statements obtained under threat of removal from office, and that it extends to all, whether they are policemen or other members of our body politic.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 500, 87 S.Ct. at 620. As in <em>Garrity, </em>subsequent Supreme Court opinions have held Fifth Amendment violations occurred where the suspect\u2019s statements were coerced by the threat of an economic sanction. <em>See, e.g., Gardner v. Broderick, </em>392 U.S. 273, 279, 88 S.Ct. 1913, 1916-17, 20 L.Ed.2d 1082 (1986) (invalidating state law which required the discharge of any police officer who refused, on Fifth Amendment grounds, to give grand jury testimony concerning police corruption); <em>Uniformed Sanitation Men Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. Commissioner of Sanitation, </em>392 U.S. 280, 283-84, 88 S.Ct. 1917, 1919-20, 20 L.Ed.2d 1089 (1968) (finding it unlawful to require sanitation employees to choose between their jobs and their self-incrimination privilege in an official investigation).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">J.D. argues that he felt compelled to answer Wright\u2019s questions because his silence would have led to some type of administrative punishment or sanction, such as suspension or expulsion. Thus, he argues, he was compelled to incriminate himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">The facts in this case are unlike the situation in <em>Garrity </em>and its progeny wherein the individuals were directly threatened with substantial economic sanctions and removal from office for refusing to answer questioning from law enforcement officers or governmental officials. The facts here are more analogous to those in <em>Husske v. Commonwealth, </em>252 Va. 203, 476 S.E.2d 920 (1996). In <em>Husske, </em>as a condition of his suspended sentence, the defendant was ordered to continue participating in a mental health program. <em>Id. </em>at 206-07, 476 S.E.2d at 922. During a session with a mental health examin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>er in the county program, the defendant made statements incriminating himself in a rape. <em>Id. </em>at 207, 476 S.E.2d at 923.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">The Supreme Court of Virginia rejected Husske\u2019s argument that use of the statements at his subsequent rape trial violated his Fifth Amendment rights, noting the absence of evidence of coercion on the part of the mental health examiner. <em>Id. </em>at 217, 476 S.E.2d at 929. The Court stated that \u201cthe defendant\u2019s obligation to participate in the mental health treatment program did not in itself convert his \u2018otherwise voluntary statements into compelled ones.\u2019 ... [N]o one required [the defendant] \u2018to choose between making incriminating statements and jeopardizing his conditional liberty by remaining silent.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 217, 476 S.E.2d at 928 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">As in <em>Husske, </em>the record in this case contains no evidence of coercion on the part of school authorities. Here, the record demonstrates that Wright merely told appellant to tell him what he knew about the thefts. Wright did not threaten J.D. with disciplinary action if he remained silent or refused to cooperate. J.D.\u2019s subjective concern that he might have received some disciplinary action is not sufficient to prove that state action coerced or compelled him to answer questions against his will. While J.D.\u2019s decision may have been difficult, this Court has recognized that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A0o\">\u201c[t]he Fifth Amendment does not insulate a defendant from all \u2018difficult choices\u2019 that are presented during the course of criminal proceedings, or even from all choices that burden the exercise or encourage waiver of the Fifth Amendment\u2019s right against self-incrimination,\u201d \u201c[N]ot every burden on the exercise of a constitutional right, and not every pressure or encouragement to waive such a right, is invalid.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b391-7\"><em>Doss v. Commonwealth, </em>23 Va.App. 679, 687-88, 479 S.E.2d 92, 96-97 (1996) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">\n<em>CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b391-9\">For the foregoing reasons, we find that the trial court did not err in denying the motion to suppress. Accordingly, we affirm J.D.\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-10\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b385-7\">. J.D. contends the United States Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>New Jersey v. T.L.O., </em>469 U.S. 325, 105 S.Ct. 733, 83 L.Ed.2d 720 (1985), dictates a finding that Wright acted as an agent of the government in interrogating J.D. In <em>T.L.O., </em>the Court held that the Fourth Amendment proscription against unreasonable searches and seizures applied to limit searches at schools conducted by public school officials. <em>See id. </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>333, 105 S.Ct. at 738. This holding in <em>T.L.O. </em>does not, however, compel a conclusion that Wright was acting as an agent of the state for purposes of the Fifth Amendment and <em>Miranda. </em>Indeed, as the Supreme Court noted in <em>T.L.O., </em>it considered <em>\"only </em>searches carried out by school authorities acting alone and on their own authority.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 342 n. 7, 105 S.Ct. at 743 n. 7 (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
