Commonwealth, </em>03 Vap UNP 0103021, 2003 WL 21057291 (2003). In that decision, a divided panel of this Court affirmed Nicko Bazemore\u2019s conviction for grand larceny, but reversed his convictions for feloniously eluding police and second degree murder. By order dated June 12, 2003, we granted the Commonwealth\u2019s petition for a rehearing <em>en banc, </em>stayed the mandate of that decision, and reinstated the appeal. Upon rehearing this case <em>en banc, </em>we affirm each of Bazemore\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>I. <em>Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">\u201cWhen an appellant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain his conviction, we review the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth and grant to it \u2018all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kelley v. Commonwealth, </em>17 Va.App. 540, 548, 489 S.E.2d 616, 621 (1994) (citation omitted). So viewed, the evidence presented during Bazemore\u2019s trial proved that on the morning of August 4, 2000, Officer M.C. Marshall noticed a broken rear window on a green minivan in the City of Suffolk and received information that the license plates on the minivan were registered to another vehicle. When Officer Marshall activated the siren and lights on his police car, the driver of the green minivan continued to drive.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">During Officer Marshall\u2019s pursuit of the green minivan, which covered a little more than a mile in relatively heavy traffic, the driver of the minivan failed to heed two stop signs, accelerated to 50 miles per hour, and later decreased his speed \u201cto ... 10 miles an hour.\u201d The green minivan made a series of turns, failed to heed another stop sign, and struck another minivan after entering the intersection. Officer Marshall could not estimate the vehicle\u2019s speed; however, he testified that his own speed was \u201capproximately 15 to 20 miles an hour\u201d when the green minivan entered the intersection. A witness described the green minivan as \u201cshooting across the intersection.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">After the green minivan hit the other minivan, yet another vehicle hit the other minivan. A passenger in the minivan that was hit sustained a fractured cervical spine and died. After the collision, the green minivan spun off the road and crashed into a nearby house.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">As Officer Marshall approached the green minivan, he observed Greg Shorter leave the van through the front passenger door. Officer Marshall also observed Bazemore moving from the driver\u2019s seat and attempting to exit through the front passenger door. Officer Marshall then arrested Shorter and Bazemore. Denise Byron, another passenger in the green <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>minivan, was found lying on the ground, after having been thrown from the van when it hit the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">When the rescue squad arrived, Bazemore complained of pain and told officers responding to the scene that he was driving the green minivan when it crashed. Officers observed that Bazemore was wearing one shoe. Inside the green minivan, officers found Bazemore\u2019s other shoe under the brake pedal. They also found a 9-mm handgun, a screwdriver, and a Florida license plate. The minivan\u2019s ignition had been damaged, and a rag was covering the steering column. The evidence proved that the green minivan had been stolen two days earlier in the City of Norfolk and that broken glass was found on the pavement after it had been stolen.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">Several hours after police arrested Bazemore, he waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights. Bazemore initially told the police that a friend, whom he only knew as \u201cMalik,\u201d and Shorter offered him a ride at 9:00 p.m. on the night before the accident. Bazemore said that he noticed the screwdriver on the floor and the broken window and that Malik told him he had gotten the van from Norfolk. Bazemore also said he learned within two hours that the van had been stolen. Later, Byron joined them and sat in the rear area of the van.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">Bazemore told police he began driving the vehicle at 3:00 a.m. He also said that after the officer attempted to stop the vehicle, he believed the vehicle might be stolen. When asked \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you stop the vehicle?,\u201d he responded \u201cI was scared.\u201d As the interview progressed, Bazemore said that Malik did not exist and that when he entered the minivan, Shorter was the driver and sole occupant. Bazemore admitted he was driving the van when the accident occurred and could not recall his speed because \u201cit happened so quick.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b259-8\">On October 25, 2000, the grand jury for the City of Suffolk indicted Bazemore on charges of grand larceny, \u201cin violation of [Code] \u00a7 18.2-95,\u201d felony eluding police, in violation of Code \u00a7\u00a7 46.2-817 and 18.2-10, and second degree murder. The indictment for second degree murder stated that Bazemore \u201cunlawfully and feloniously while in the prosecution of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>felonious act, accidentally, contrary to the intention of the parties, did Mil and murder ... in violation of [Code] \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-33,18.2-32, and 18.2-26.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">During his trial, after the trial judge had denied Bazemore\u2019s motion to strike the evidence, Bazemore testified that Shorter, who is also called \u201cMalik,\u201d was driving the green minivan when he entered it. They spent the hours before the incident driving to various places. Bazemore testified he was driving when Byron joined them at 5:30 or 6:00 in the morning, but he denied seeing the broken steering column. Although he knew Shorter did not own the minivan and did not have money to buy a vehicle, he did not ask Shorter where he obtained it or who owned it.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">Bazemore also testified that, after the police signaled him to stop and began to pursue him, he and Shorter switched places in the moving vehicle. He said that Shorter was driving when the vehicle entered the intersection and that he did not remember telling police he was driving when the collision occurred. Despite his previous statement to police that he had not seen a gun in the van, Bazemore testified that Shorter displayed the gun, said he was not going back to prison, and ignored Bazemore\u2019s and Byron\u2019s requests to stop. Bazemore also testified that after the accident, Shorter crawled across him from the driver seat to get out of the van. He testified that he lied to the police in the interview to protect Shorter because he \u201cwas afraid of everything that was going on around him\u201d and afraid of Shorter.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">The jury convicted Bazemore of \u201cgrand larceny by receiving stolen property,\u201d of the \u201cfelony ... of disregarding the signal of a law enforcement officer,\u201d and of \u201cfelony homicide.\u201d The final conviction order denotes the convictions as \u201cGrand Larceny ([Code] \u00a7 18.2-95),\u201d \u201cEluding Poliee-Endangerment (\u00a7 46.2-81[7](B) (Felony),\u201d and \u201cSecond Degree Murder (\u00a7 18.2-32) (Felony).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">II. <em>Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b260-9\">On appeal, Bazemore contends (1) the evidence was insufficient to support the convictions, (2) the trial judge erred by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>refusing to give the jury an instruction defining the word \u201cwanton,\u201d and (3) the trial judge erred by failing to properly instruct the jury on the elements of the offense of feloniously eluding the police and, thus, permitted the jury to improperly convict him of feloniously eluding the police and felony homicide. For the reasons that follow, we affirm Bazemore\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">Bazemore first contends the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction for grand larceny by receiving stolen property. Specifically, he argues the evidence was insufficient to prove he knew the vehicle was stolen, intended to permanently deprive the owner of the vehicle, and had dishonest intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">We first note, in regard to this argument, that Bazemore contends the evidence was insufficient to convict him of violating Code \u00a7 18.2-108. The final conviction order recites, however, that the conviction was for grand larceny in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-95, which was the charge specified in the indictment. Although neither Bazemore nor the Commonwealth addressed this discrepancy, we address it for purposes of clarity.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">The record reflects that the trial judge\u2019s instructions permitted the jury to convict Bazemore of \u201cgrand larceny,\u201d which was the offense charged in the indictment, or to convict him of other lesser offenses, including \u201cgrand larceny by receiving stolen property.\u201d The verdict form establishes that the jury convicted Bazemore of \u201cgrand larceny by receiving stolen property,\u201d which is prohibited by Code \u00a7 18.2-108. Following the guilt phase of the trial, the jury fixed Bazemore\u2019s punishment at one year in prison for \u201cgrand larceny by receiving stolen property.\u201d Consistent with the jury\u2019s findings, the trial judge entered an order reflecting that the jury convicted Bazemore and fixed his sentence for \u201cgrand larceny by receiving stolen property.\u201d The final conviction order, however, contains no reference to Code \u00a7 18.2-108 and recites only that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>Bazemore was convicted of \u201cgrand larceny ([Code] \u00a7 18.2-95).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">The Supreme Court has held that \u201c[r]eceiving stolen goods, knowing the same to be stolen, may be charged as larceny.\u201d <em>Clark v. Commonwealth, </em>135 Va. 490, 498, 115 S.E. 704, 706 (1923), <em>overruled on other grounds by Chittum v. Commonwealth, </em>211 Va. 12, 174 S.E.2d 779 (1970). <em>See also Cobbler v. Commonwealth, </em>212 Va. 520, 524, 184 S.E.2d 781, 783 (1971) (holding that \u201c[l]arceny by receiving stolen goods is a lesser offense which is included in the major one of larceny\u201d). In view of these decisions, the jury\u2019s verdict forms, and the trial judge\u2019s order entered upon the jury\u2019s verdict, we hold that the trial judge\u2019s failure to include a reference to Code \u00a7 18.2-108 on the final conviction order was a mere clerical error. We further remand this matter to the trial court for the limited purpose of correcting that error.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">Turning to the merits of Bazemore\u2019s argument, we recognize that Code \u00a7 18.2-108 provides that \u201c[i]f any person buy or receive from another person, or aid in concealing, any stolen goods or other thing, knowing the same to have been stolen, he shall be deemed guilty of larceny thereof, and may be proceeded against, although the principal offender be not convicted.\u201d We have described the elements of the offense as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-6\">\u201cTo convict a defendant under Code \u00a7 18.2-108, the Commonwealth must prove that property \u2018was (1) previously stolen by another, and (2) received by defendant, (3) with knowledge of the theft, and (4) a dishonest intent.\u2019 Guilty knowledge \u2018is sufficiently shown if the circumstances proven are such as must have made or caused the recipient of stolen goods to believe they were stolen.\u2019 \u201d <em>Shaver v. Commonwealth, </em>30 Va.App. 789, 800-01, 520 S.E.2d 393, 399 (1999). \u201cGuilty knowledge ... [a]bsent proof of an admission against interest, ... necessarily must be shown by circumstantial evidence.\u201d <em>Lewis v. Commonwealth, </em>225 Va. 497, 503, 303 S.E.2d 890, 893 (1983).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b263-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number><em>Snow v. Commonwealth, </em>33 Va.App. 766, 775, 537 S.E.2d 6, 11 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">The evidence in the case at bar, when viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, proved that Bazemore confessed to police that shortly after he entered the green minivan, he learned it had been stolen. He also saw the minivan\u2019s broken window and the screwdriver on the floor. Thus, by Bazemore\u2019s own admission, he knew he was driving a stolen vehicle before he failed to heed the officer\u2019s signal. The evidence also proved Bazemore admitted to an inmate in jail that he knew the vehicle was stolen. Moreover, apart from his own confession and the testimony of an inmate, the evidence proved Bazemore was driving the vehicle in daylight and had the opportunity to see the \u201cpopped\u201d ignition, the broken steering column, and a rag covering the steering column.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">The jury was not required to accept Bazemore\u2019s trial testimony. <em>Marable v. Commonwealth, </em>27 Va.App. 505, 509-10, 500 S.E.2d 233, 235 (1998). It was free to believe or disbelieve, in part or in whole, the testimony of any witness. <em>Rollston v. Commonwealth, </em>11 Va.App. 535, 547, 399 S.E.2d 823, 830 (1991). Although Bazemore\u2019s testimony differed from his confession, \u201cthe jury was \u2018not obliged to accept\u2019 what it obviously found was an unreasonable explanation,\u201d <em>Roberts v. Commonwealth, </em>230 Va. 264, 272, 337 S.E.2d 255, 260 (1985), and was free to believe his confessed participation. We hold the evidence was sufficient for the jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that Bazemore knew the vehicle was stolen when he drove it.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">Bazemore also contends the evidence was insufficient to prove he intended to permanently deprive the owner of the minivan. However, Bazemore\u2019s reliance on <em>Moehring v. Commonwealth, </em>223 Va. 564, 290 S.E.2d 891 (1982), to support his defense that he had no intent to permanently deprive is misplaced. The Supreme Court noted the following in reversing Moehring\u2019s conviction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>There is no evidence in the record which demonstrates that Moehring exercised any degree of dominion or control over the stolen truck, or from which the court could have inferred that defendant possessed the truck jointly with Faison .... The most that can be said with reasonable certainty is that this defendant-hitchhiker accepted a ride from the first person who stopped and that he knew that person was driving a stolen vehicle.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b264-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 568, 290 S.E.2d at 893. Pertinent to the evidence in this case, the Supreme Court of Virginia in <em>Moehring </em>restated the well-settled rule that \u201c[bjecause larceny is a continuing offense, anyone who knows that personal property is stolen and assists in its transportation or disposition is guilty of larceny.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The evidence here proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Bazemore knew the vehicle was stolen and drove it with that knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">Bazemore further argues that the evidence was insufficient to prove he had dishonest intent. We have consistently held, however, that issues that were not properly preserved at trial cannot be raised on appeal. <em>Andrews v. Commonwealth, </em>37 Va.App. 479, 493, 559 S.E.2d 401, 408 (2002). Bazemore never raised the argument of dishonest intent before the trial court. Because, on this record, we find no reason to consider this argument pursuant to the \u201cgood cause\u201d or \u201cends of justice\u201d exceptions to Rule 5A:18, we do not review this issue, raised for the first time on appeal. <em>See </em>Rule 5A:18.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">Bazemore next contends on appeal that the trial judge erred in failing to instruct the jury on the definition of \u201cwanton.\u201d Bazemore argues that because of this error his convictions for felony eluding police and felony homicide must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">To prove a violation of Code \u00a7 46.2-817, the Commonwealth had to prove Bazemore drove the \u201cmotor vehicle in a willful and wanton disregard\u201d of the officer\u2019s signal. Nevertheless, Bazemore did not ask the judge to instruct the jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>concerning the definition of \u201cwanton.\u201d Therefore, we will not review the issue for the first time on appeal. <em>See </em>Rule 5A:18. Furthermore, we find that this record provides no basis to consider this claim under the exceptions to Rule 5A:18.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">In his final arguments on appeal, Bazemore contends the evidence was insufficient to prove he wantonly disregarded the officer\u2019s signal to stop. He also contends the trial judge incorrectly instructed the jury concerning the elements of Code \u00a7 46.2-817 by placing the elements of \u201cwillfull\u201d and \u201cwanton\u201d in the disjunctive, rather than in the conjunctive. Consequently, Bazemore argues his felony eluding conviction should be reversed and, because his felony homicide conviction was contingent upon the felony eluding conviction, that conviction must also be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">At the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence, Bazemore\u2019s trial attorney made a motion to strike. He conceded Bazemore operated the minivan. He argued, however, that because Bazemore did not know the minivan was stolen, the evidence failed to prove grand larceny. Thus, he argued that grand larceny, which he asserted should have been the predicate offense for felony homicide, was not proved. He then argued as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-8\">I would submit ... that the eluding is a separate and distinct crime, that the essence of which is [failure] to heed the police signal to stop under circumstances that create danger to the motoring or pedestrian traffic.... I would submit, Judge, that that is not a sufficient predicate for felony murder to apply.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b265-9\">At the conclusion of the evidence, Bazemore\u2019s trial attorney also moved to strike the evidence concerning the eluding charge, asserting \u201cthere [wasn\u2019t] any real clear, intelligent evidence that [Bazemore] was actually operating the vehicle for any length of time that the vehicle failed to stop when the blue lights were on and the car was being driven in such fashion as to endanger.\u201d Bazemore\u2019s attorney argued, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>because credible evidence proved Shorter had switched places with Bazemore, \u201c[tjhere\u2019s no evidence to clearly demonstrate that anyone was endangered at any time for a felony eluding when [Bazemore] was operating the vehicle. And the evidence before you is that when he wanted to stop, he couldn\u2019t stop because [Shorter] had brandished a weapon ... and said, \u2018Drive on.\u2019 \u201d Summarizing, Bazemore\u2019s trial attorney argued as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-5\">[T]hey have to prove for the reckless endangerment element that the defendant was driving at the time to create a danger to the motoring or pedestrian public. They can\u2019t do that. We would have to guess, the Court would have to guess at [the] point that endangerment occurred. So I would submit, Your Honor, that the charge of felony eluding, likewise, has to fall because there is insufficient evidence to support the conclusion that at the relevant time that the defendant was actually driving a car or this van to endanger the motoring public.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">As to the felony-homicide charge, he argued as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-7\">We would also ... move to strike the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence as to second degree murder. It\u2019s clear that this was an accident, that whoever was driving that it was not the intended purpose to do that, and ... the evidence before the Court is that the defendant was not the operator of the vehicle at the time of the collision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">These arguments, which the trial judge rejected, also formed the gist of Bazemore\u2019s counsel\u2019s closing argument to the jury. Urging the jury to analyze \u201cthe elements of the offenses,\u201d he discussed in detail the elements of the larceny offense. As to \u201cthe eluding,\u201d he posed the question, \u201cwhere is the evidence that Nicko Bazemore was operating ... the [vehicle] at any time that created a danger to the public?\u201d Thus, he argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-9\">So, if, indeed, you conclude that [Bazemore] was not the driver of the [vehicle] at the time of the collision, he could not be convicted of felony murder. If you believe that he was not driving at any time when the vehicle presented a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>danger to the motoring public, he could not be convicted of eluding a felony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b267-4\">At all stages of the trial, Bazemore contended he was not driving when the vehicle entered the intersection in disregard of the stop sign and collided with the van. At no point did he object that the evidence was insufficient to prove the element of \u201cwanton.\u201d The failure to raise these issues at trial bars our consideration of them on appeal. Rule 5A:18. <em>See Floyd v. Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 575, 583-85, 249 S.E.2d 171, 176 (1978) (holding that appellate review of the issue of insufficiency to prove a specific element is barred when that issue was not raised at trial). Moreover, in view of the arguments Bazemore actually advanced at trial and the evidence produced, we conclude that no basis exists to invoke the exceptions to Rule 5A:18.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">We find that we are likewise precluded from considering Bazemore\u2019s final contention that the trial judge erred in instructing the jury on the elements of the offense of eluding. The instruction given, read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-6\">The Court instructs the jury that the defendant is charged with a felony crime of disregarding a signal of a law enforcement officer to stop. The Commonwealth must prove beyond a reasonable doubt each of the following elements of a crime. Number 1, that the defendant was driving a motor vehicle; and Number 2, that he received a visible and/or audible signal from a law enforcement officer to bring his motor vehicle to a stop; and Number 3, that he willfully or wantonly disregarded such signal so as to endanger any person....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">The record reflects that Bazemore did not object to the jury instruction in any manner. Indeed, Bazemore does not dispute his failure to raise an objection below, but contends that we must address this issue because it falls within the \u201cends of justice\u201d exception to Rule 5A:18.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">We begin our analysis by recognizing that Code \u00a7 46.2-817 provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>[a]ny person who, having received a visible or audible signal from any law-enforcement officer to bring his motor vehicle to a stop, drives such motor vehicle in a willful <em>and </em>wanton disregard of such signal so as to interfere with or endanger the operation of the law-enforcement vehicle or endanger a person is guilty of a Class 6 felony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">(Emphasis added). The trial judge instructed the jury that the Commonwealth was required to \u201cprove beyond a reasonable doubt ... that [Bazemore] willfully <em>or </em>wantonly disregarded such signal so as to endanger any person.\u201d (Emphasis added).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The parties do not dispute the fact that the instruction, as given, was an incorrect statement of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">Nevertheless,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-7\">[u]nder Rule 5A:18 we do not notice the trial errors for which no timely objection was made except in extraordinary situations when necessary to enable us to attain the ends of justice. The laudatory purpose behind Rule 5A:18, and its equivalent Supreme Court Rule 5:25, frequently referred to as the contemporaneous objection rules, is to require that objections be promptly brought to the attention of the trial court with sufficient specificity that the alleged error can be dealt with and timely addressed and corrected when necessary. The rules promote orderly and efficient justice and are to be strictly enforced except where the error has resulted in manifest injustice. Errors can usually be corrected in the trial court, particularly in a bench trial, without the necessity of appeal. Because our function is to review the rulings of the trial court, rather than superintend the proceedings, we will notice error for which there has been no timely objection only when necessary to satisfy the ends of justice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b268-8\"><em>Brown v.

Bazemore admittedly disregarded the officer\u2019s signal to stop in an effort to elude police. Furthermore, it is significant to note that because the jury found Bazemore guilty of felony homicide, it is clear the <em>jury </em>found he was driving the minivan at the time of the fatal collision. Thus, the evidence established that in his effort to elude police, Bazemore continued to drive at speeds of up to 50 miles per hour in \u201crelatively heavy\u201d traffic, he failed to heed three stop signs, and he drove through a busy intersection without yielding. Bazemore\u2019s failure to yield in that intersection, which was located in a \u201cmostly residential and small businesses area,\u201d caused the fatal collision. Accordingly, an examination of the record demonstrates that, whether Bazemore acted because he was \u201cscared\u201d or otherwise, it would have been difficult for a rational trier of fact to reach any conclusion other than that Bazemore drove the minivan in a manner so as to willfully <em>and </em>wantonly disregard the police officer\u2019s signal and, therefore, place others in danger.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">Moreover, unlike the situation in <em>Campbell, </em>Bazemore never contested the elements of \u201cwillfulness\u201d or \u201cwantoness.\u201d In fact, Bazemore\u2019s only trial strategy was to claim that he was not driving the green minivan when the fatal collision occurred and/or when the \u201cvehicle presented a danger to the motoring public.\u201d Bazemore never contested the fact that the minivan was driven in a willful and wanton manner, so as to elude police and place others in danger.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>Further, the erroneous jury instruction, as given, did not allow the jury to convict Bazemore of \u201cotherwise innocent behavior.\u201d <em>See Campbell, </em>14 Va.App. at 995, 421 S.E.2d at 656.

Whether the jury found, under the instruction as given, that by his driving the vehicle Bazemore willfully <em>or </em>wantonly disregarded Officer Marshall\u2019s signal, \u201cso as to endanger any person,\u201d either classification would give rise to a finding that Bazemore committed conduct that was not \u201cotherwise innocent behavior,\u201d but was a criminal offense. <em>See Campbell, </em>14 Va.App. at 995, 421 S.E.2d at 656.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">Accordingly, finding no miscarriage of justice on this record, we decline Bazemore\u2019s invitation to consider his argument pursuant to the \u201cends of justice\u201d exception to Rule 5A:18.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">For the above-stated reasons, we find no merit in Bazemore\u2019s arguments on appeal and we, therefore, affirm his convictions for grand larceny, feloniously eluding police and second degree murder.

In giving a defective jury instruction in this case, the judge allowed the jury to convict Bazemore if it found that he willfully or wantonly disregarded the signal of the law enforcement officer. By posing the elements in the disjunctive, the instruction permitted the jury to convict Bazemore of an offense that does not exist in Virginia law. <em>See Marshall v.

I would hold, instead, that the trial judge erred in giving the instruction that permitted the jury to convict Bazemore of a non-existent offense. Therefore, I would reverse the judgments of convictions for feloniously eluding the law enforcement officer and for felony homicide, which was predicated upon feloniously eluding the law enforcement officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">The Commonwealth contends that even if the \u201cends of justice\u201d exception applies, the convictions nevertheless should be affirmed because the error was harmless.

Equally important, the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides that \u201c[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a ... trial, by an impartial jury.\u201d A necessary corollary to these two principles is that in a jury trial, \u201c[t]he Constitution gives a criminal defendant the right to have a jury determine, beyond a reasonable doubt, his guilt of every element of the crime with which he is charged.\u201d <em>United States v.

By instructing the jury in the disjunctive, the judge violated these principles and created error of a constitutional magnitude.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">\u201c[B]efore a federal constitutional error can be held harmless, the court must be able to declare a belief that it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Chapman v.

Harmless-error review looks ... to the basis on which \u201cthe jury <em>actually rested </em>its verdict.\u201d The inquiry, in other words, is not whether, in a trial that occurred without the error, a guilty verdict would surely have been rendered, but whether the guilty verdict actually rendered in <em>this </em>trial was surely unattributable to the error. That must be so, because to hypothesize .a guilty verdict that was never in fact rendered \u2014 no matter how inescapable the findings to support that verdict might be \u2014 would violate the jury-trial guarantee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number><em>Sullivan v.

United States, </em>524 U.S. 184, 191, 118 S.Ct. 1939, 1945, 141 L.Ed.2d 197 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">To prove the other necessary element of the offense, wanton disregard, the evidence must show recklessness plus additional culpability. <em>See Town of Big Stone Gap v. Johnson, </em>184 Va. 375, 379, 35 S.E.2d 71, 73 (1945) (citing <em>Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary, </em>2d ed.).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-9\">\u201cWanton differs from reckless both as to the actual state of mind and as to the degree of culpability. One who is acting recklessly is fully aware of the unreasonable risk he is creating, but may be trying and hoping to avoid any harm. One acting wantonly may be creating no greater risk of harm, but he is not trying to avoid it and is indifferent to whether harm results or not. Wanton conduct has properly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>been characterized as \u2018vicious\u2019 and rates extreme in the degree of culpability. The two are not mutually exclusive. Wanton conduct is reckless plus, so to speak.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b280-4\"><em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1576 (7th ed.1999) (quoting Rollin M. Perkins &amp; Ronald N. Boyce, <em>Criminal Law </em>879-80 (3d ed.1982)).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">Because the trial judge incorrectly instructed the jury by placing the statutory elements of \u201cwillful\u201d and \u201cwanton\u201d in the disjunctive, we cannot have any degree of confidence that the jury actually found both elements were proved beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-6\">\u201cThe test ... is not whether laying aside the [error] there was other evidence sufficient to convict beyond a reasonable doubt ..., but, more stringently, \u201cwhether there is a reasonable possibility that the [error] complained of might have contributed to the conviction.\u2019 \u201d In other words, even if \u201cthe other evidence amply supports the ... verdicts, [error is not harmless when it] may well have affected the ... decision.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-7\">An \u201cemphasis and perhaps overemphasis, upon the [concept] of \u2018overwhelming evidence\u2019 \u201d has the effect of clouding the relevant question \u201c \u2018whether there is a reasonable possibility that the [error] complained of might have contributed to the conviction.\u2019 \u201d As the Supreme Court has stated, \u201c[t]he correct inquiry is whether, assuming that the damaging potential of the [error] were fully realized, a reviewing court might nonetheless say that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Thus, \u201ca harmless error analysis ... [is not] simply a sufficiency of the evidence analysis.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b280-8\"><em>Williams v. Commonwealth, </em>32 Va.App. 395, 399-400, 528 S.E.2d 166, 168-69 (2000) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-9\">Recently, in a civil case where the issue was whether conduct was \u201cso willful or wanton ... [to] support an award of punitive damages,\u201d the Supreme Court ruled that the evidence was insufficient to prove either. <em>Doe v. Isaacs, </em>265 Va. 531, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>535, 579 S.E.2d 174, 176-77 (2003). The Court summarized the lack of evidence as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-5\">Clearly, the defendant\u2019s actions, involving violation of traffic laws and rules of the road, demonstrated a disregard of prudence to the level that the safety of others was completely neglected. But this conduct amounts to gross negligence, which shocks fair-minded people; it is less than willful recklessness. The required \u201cactual or constructive consciousness that injury will result from the act done or omitted,\u201d is lacking in the proof.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-6\">At the most from the plaintiffs\u2019 standpoint, the defendant did not keep a proper lookout for vehicles nearly stopped ahead of him, he did not keep his vehicle under proper control, he probably was intoxicated to some extent, and he feloniously left the scene of the accident in violation of Code \u00a7 46.2-894. There is no evidence that defendant exceeded the speed limit or a reasonable speed under the circumstances. He was driving on his proper side of the street, apparently operating a properly functioning vehicle. In sum, the defendant\u2019s behavior was not the \u201cegregious\u201d conduct spoken of in our cases.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b281-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 538, 579 S.E.2d at 178 (citations omitted). Thus, although exemplary damages <em>(see </em>Code \u00a7 8.01-44.5) are permitted in a civil case upon a showing of \u201cwillful or wanton\u201d conduct, <em>Isaacs, </em>265 Va. at 536, 579 S.E.2d at 174, the evidence the Supreme Court reviewed above proved neither element, even though the plaintiff only had to prove either by a mere preponderance.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">The evidence before the jury in this case, where the prosecution had the burden of proving \u201cwillful and wanton\u201d disregard beyond a reasonable doubt, is equally deficient. It did not prove Bazemore exceeded any posted speed limits. Although the officer testified that at one point Bazemore accelerated to fifty miles per hour, the evidence does not establish the posted speed limit on this road. The evidence strongly suggests, however, that Bazemore was within the speed limit because the road was a four-lane \u201cthoroughfare that runs ... from Suffolk to [the State of North] Carolina.\u201d The officer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>also testified that after Bazemore left this road, Bazemore\u2019s speed decreased \u201cto approximately 10 miles an hour when he turned into a residential area.\u201d No evidence suggests Bazemore was violating the posted speed limit as he left the residential area and entered the intersection. Indeed, the officer behind Bazemore testified his own speed was approximately fifteen to twenty miles per hour when Bazemore drove into the intersection. The severity of the collision in the intersection likely is explained by Bazemore\u2019s vehicle hitting a minivan that was travelling on a four-lane divided highway with a greater speed. In the absence of proof Bazemore was driving at an excessive speed, it is difficult to conclude that a reasonable jury would have found the necessary mercilessness to justify a finding of wanton disregard.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">The evidence also leaves uncertain whether the jury based its conviction on a finding of willful conduct. Significantly, the jury accepted Bazemore\u2019s testimony that he did not steal the vehicle and convicted him of larceny upon his testimony that he knew he was driving a vehicle Shorter had stolen. The jury also may have believed Bazemore\u2019s testimony that he did not stop because he was \u201cscared\u201d and that he also was afraid Shorter would have harmed him. However, even if the jury accepted Bazemore\u2019s testimony and found that he did not intentionally violate the traffic laws but acted out of fear, <em>see id. </em>at 535, 579 S.E.2d at 176 (reaffirming the long standing rule that \u201c \u2018the intentional violation of a traffic law, without more, will not support a finding of willful and wanton [conduct]\u2019 \u201d), the jury still could have applied the defective instruction and convicted Bazemore.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">Simply put, even though the majority opinion concludes that the evidence is perhaps adequate to support a finding of wanton and willful disregard, it is entirely possible that the jury convicted Bazemore solely on a finding of either willful or wanton disregard of the officer\u2019s signal. Indeed, it is highly probable that the jury did so because, without an instruction requiring the jury to find that both elements were proved beyond a reasonable doubt, we cannot assume the jury per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>formed a task that was neither necessary nor required under the defective instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">When a defendant elects to be tried by a jury \u201cin a criminal case[,] the law assigns [the factfinding function] solely to the jury.\u201d <em>Sandstrom v. Montana, </em>442 U.S. 510, 523, 99 S.Ct. 2450, 61 L.Ed.2d 39 (1979). Therefore, we cannot on appeal supplement the jury\u2019s finding to add an element the jury was not required to consider. Indeed, to do so, we would, in effect, commit the same error the trial judge committed \u2014 we would determine the evidence proved beyond a reasonable doubt the element of the offense the jury was required to find but was not instructed to find. We would make an independent determination of the credibility of witnesses and weight of the evidence, both of which \u201care matters solely for the fact finder.\u201d <em>Hampton v. Commonwealth, </em>32 Va.App. 644, 648, 529 S.E.2d 843, 845 (2000). Instead of compounding the error, we can avoid negating the jury\u2019s fact finding function by giving effect to the well established principle that a harmless error analysis is entirely distinct from an analysis of the sufficiency of the evidence. <em>See Cartera v. Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 516, 519, 248 S.E.2d 784, 786 (1978) (holding that even if \u201cthe other evidence amply supports the ... verdicts, [error is not harmless when] the [error] may well have affected the ... decision\u201d); <em>Hooker v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 454, 458, 418 S.E.2d 343, 345 (1992) (holding that \u201ca harmless error analysis ... [is not] simply a sufficiency of the evidence analysis\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">The jury\u2019s verdict in this case plainly was the result of a finding premised upon Bazemore acting either wantonly or willfully, but not both.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-7\">[T]he United States Constitution requires that the jury, in a criminal case, determine beyond a reasonable doubt that the government has proven each element necessary to constitute the crime charged. Thus, a judge in a criminal case may not direct a verdict, even a partial verdict, for the government even though the evidence is overwhelming or even undisputed on the point. When a judge gives an instruction preventing the jury from considering a material <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>issue, that instruction is equivalent to an impermissible directed verdict on the issue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b284-5\"><em>United States v. Piche, </em>981 F.2d 706, 716 (4th Cir.1992) (citations omitted). Certainly, if \u201ca trial judge is prohibited from entering a judgment of conviction or directing the jury to come forward with such a verdict ..., regardless of how overwhelmingly the evidence may point in that direction,\u201d <em>United States v. Martin Linen Supply Co., </em>430 U.S. 564, 572-73, 97 S.Ct. 1349, 1355, 51 L.Ed.2d 642 (1977), an appellate court cannot supplement on appeal the jury\u2019s fact finding function by applying a sufficiency analysis to conclude that an element of the offense, not found by the jury, was proved beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">For these reasons, I would hold that the error was not harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">Lastly, I would note that on several occasions, the Supreme Court has reversed convictions for non-existent offenses. In <em>Bundy v. Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 485, 259 S.E.2d 826 (1979), the Court ruled as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-9\">We believe that the weapons verdict in this case ... plainly convicts the defendant of the use of a firearm while committing, not murder, but some undesignated other felony. Under the weapons statute as it read prior to 1976, such a verdict might have been proper.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-10\">[A]s a result of the 1976 amendment to Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1, the use of a firearm \u201cwhile committing a felony\u201d no longer is sufficient to constitute a violation of the statute. Now, a violation occurs only when a firearm is used with respect to the specified felonies of murder, rape, robbery, burglary, and abduction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-11\">The offense in this case and the prosecution therefor took place after the effective date of the amendment to Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1. Yet, under instructions erroneously framed to permit such action, the jury was given free rein either to convict the defendant of the no-longer existing offense of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>using a firearm in the commission of a felony or to convict him of using a firearm while committing murder. The jury convicted the defendant of the non-existent offense. Clearly, therefore, the defendant\u2019s firearms conviction must be reversed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-5\">The erroneous instructions which led to the anomalous result reached below were granted, if not at the Commonwealth\u2019s request, in the absence of any objection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b285-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 487-88, 259 S.E.2d at 828. <em>See also Jimenez, </em>241 Va. at 251, 402 S.E.2d at 681 (holding that Jimenez\u2019s failure to object at trial did not waive \u201chis right to raise this matter on appeal\u201d because the judge\u2019s \u201cinstruction omitted some essential elements of the offense\u201d and permitted the jury to convict Jimenez \u201cof a non-offense\u201d); <em>Ball v. Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 754, 758-59, 273 S.E.2d 790, 793 (1981) (reversing a conviction for capital murder because the evidence proved a homicide during an attempted robbery, which was not then one of the statutorily defined predicate offenses of capital murder).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">In my view, a circuit court lacks the power to convict an accused criminal defendant of a \u201cnon-existent offense.\u201d A conviction of a \u201cnon-existent offense\u201d implicates the circuit court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction and, thus, is cognizable on a direct appeal from such a conviction. Indeed, the Supreme Court has held \u201cthat \u2018[sjubject matter jurisdiction is granted by constitution or statute,\u2019 that \u2018[i]t cannot be waived,\u2019 that \u2018any judgment rendered without it is void <em>ab initio,\u2019 </em>and that \u2018lack of subject matter jurisdiction \u201cmay be raised at any time, in any manner, before any court, or by the court itself.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Nelson v. Warden, </em>262 Va. 276, 281, 552 S.E.2d 73, 75 (2001) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">Because the jury convicted Bazemore of a non-existent criminal offense, I would hold that the circuit court exceeded its jurisdictional power when it convicted Bazemore of an offense that does not exist under the criminal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-9\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-10\">In summary, I would affirm the grand larceny conviction and remand to the trial judge to correct that conviction order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>by inserting a reference to Code \u00a7 18.2-108. I would reverse the convictions for felony eluding a law enforcement officer and felony homicide, and I would remand for a new trial where the jury may be properly instructed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
