Watkins contends that the circuit court trial judge erred in finding the evidence sufficient to support the termination pursuant to Code \u00a7 16.1-283(C)(2). Watkins also claims the trial judge erred in admitting the hearsay testimony of a witness who testified during the termination proceedings. Because we find that Watkins failed to properly perfect her appeal, we do not reach the merits of these issues and we dismiss her appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-10\">In her brief on appeal, the guardian <em>ad litem </em>for Watkins\u2019s children raised an \u201cAdditional Question Presented.\u201d Specifically, and in that form, the guardian <em>ad litem </em>moves this Court to dismiss Watkins\u2019s appeal because Watkins failed to name the guardian <em>ad litem </em>as an appellee in her notice of appeal. For the following reasons, we find that Watkins failed to properly and timely note her appeal with respect to the guardian <em>ad litem, </em>an \u201cindispensable party,\u201d and we dismiss the appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b812-11\">We first, briefly note the facts relevant to this narrow issue. Fairfax County Department of Family Services placed Wat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>kins\u2019s two minor children in an \u201cemergency foster home\u201d in December of 2001. In March of 2002, the Fairfax County Juvenile and Domestic Relations District Court terminated Watkins\u2019s residual parental rights. Watkins subsequently noted an appeal for a trial <em>de novo </em>in the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">During the three-day hearing on Watkins\u2019s <em>de novo </em>appeal, the appointed guardian <em>ad litem </em>for Watkins\u2019s children supported the Department\u2019s petition to terminate Watkins\u2019s residual parental rights. Ultimately, the trial court ruled that Watkins had failed to substantially remedy the \u201cproblems which brought the children into foster care,\u201d within the requisite time period set forth in Code \u00a7 16.1-283(0(2), and that it was thus in the best interests of the children that Watkins\u2019s \u201cparental rights be terminated.\u201d Both final orders \u2014 one pertaining to each child \u2014 were \u201c[e]ntered on June 23, 2003.\u201d The guardian <em>ad litem </em>endorsed the final termination orders under the headings \u201cI ask for this,\u201d and indicated \u201cSeen and Agreed\u201d over her signatures.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">Watkins noted her appeal to this Court on or about July 23, 2003. The record demonstrates that Watkins failed to list the guardian <em>ad litem </em>as an opposing party in her Notice of Appeal, as well as in her subsequent Amended Notice of Appeal. The record further shows that Watkins failed to list the guardian <em>ad litem </em>in the accompanying certificates of service, and there is no evidence that Watkins mailed or delivered a copy of the notices to the guardian <em>ad litem </em>within 30 days after entry of the final orders. The record does reflect, however, that Watkins subsequently listed the guardian <em>ad litem </em>in the certificates of service appended to her motion for extension of time to file the transcript, her statement of questions presented and designation of contents to be included in the appendix, as well as her opening brief on appeal. The guardian <em>ad litem </em>thus timely filed a brief on behalf of the children.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In her brief, the guardian <em>ad litem </em>requested that the appeal be dismissed because Watkins failed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>to notify her of the appeal. Specifically, the guardian <em>ad litem </em>argues that this Court must dismiss Watkins\u2019s appeal because the guardian <em>ad litem, </em>an indispensable party, was not \u201clist[ed]\u201d in the notice of appeal or the amended notice of appeal, and because Watkins failed to certify, in either document, that a copy of the notice was \u201cmailed or delivered to the guardian <em>ad litem </em>in accordance with Rule 5A:6(d).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">Code \u00a7 17.1-408 states, \u201c[a] notice of appeal to the Court of Appeals shall be filed in every case within the court\u2019s appellate jurisdiction as provided in \u00a7 8.01-675.3.\u201d The notice of appeal must be filed \u201cwith the clerk of the trial court,\u201d Code \u00a7 17.1-407, and, \u201cshall be filed within 30 days from the date of any final judgment order, decree or conviction,\u201d Code \u00a7 8.01-675.3. The \u201ctime[ ] prescribed for filing the notice of appeal ... [is] mandatory,\u201d Rule 5A:3(a), and, if not adhered to, \u201c[n]o appeal shall be allowed,\u201d Rule 5A:6. Rule 5A:16(a) provides that appeals as a matter of right are \u201cperfected by the timely filing of a notice of appeal pursuant to Rule 5A:6.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b814-6\">Rule 5A:6 specifically provides as follows, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b814-7\">(a) Timeliness. \u2014 No appeal shall be allowed unless, within 30 days after entry of final judgment or other appealable order or decree, counsel files with the clerk of the trial court a notice of appeal, and at the same time mails or delivers a copy of such notice to all opposing counsel and the clerk of the Court of Appeals____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b814-8\">?}{ jjs sj: sfc 5}s</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b814-9\">(d) Certificate. \u2014 The appellant shall include with the notice of appeal a certificate stating:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b814-10\">(1) the names and addresses of all appellants and appellees, the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of counsel for each party, and the address and telephone number of any party not represented by counsel; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b814-11\">(2) that a copy of the notice of appeal has been mailed or delivered to all opposing counsel....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b815-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>The guardian <em>ad litem </em>correctly notes that we have held \u201cin a suit involving a termination of parental rights, a guardian <em>ad litem </em>for the child or children is an indispensable party to the appeal and, thus, qualifies as an \u2018opposing counsel\u2019 under Rule 5A:6(a), to whom the appellant has a duty to mail or deliver a copy of the notice of appeal.\u201d <em>M.G. v. Albemarle County Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs., </em>41 Va.App. 170, 177, 583 S.E.2d 761, 764 (2003) (citing <em>Hughes v. York County Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs., </em>36 Va.App. 22, 25-26, 548 S.E.2d 237, 238-39 (2001)). Indeed, the guardian <em>ad litem </em>is clearly an indispensable party in termination cases because the statute governing the appointment of guardians <em>ad litem </em>in termination proceedings, Code \u00a7 16.1-266, mandates their appointment in such cases.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">The Supreme Court of Virginia has used the terms \u201cindispensable parties\u201d and \u201cnecessary parties\u201d synonymously. <em>See Asch v. Friends of Mt. Vernon Yacht Club, </em>251 Va. 89, 90-91, 465 S.E.2d 817, 818 (1996).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In that context, the Court defines the term \u201cnecessary party\u201d broadly, holding that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b815-6\">\u201c \u201cWhere an individual is in the actual enjoyment of the subject matter, or has an interest in it, either in possession or expectancy, which is likely either to be defeated or diminished by the plaintiffs claim, in such case he has an immediate interest in resisting the demand, and all persons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>who have such immediate interests are necessary parties to the suit.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b816-4\"><em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Raney v. Four Thirty Seven Land Co., </em>233 Va. 513, 519-20, 357 S.E.2d 733, 736 (1987) (quoting <em>Gaddess v. Norris, </em>102 Va. 625, 630, 46 S.E. 905, 907 (1904))). Thus, the Court has consistently held that \u201ca court lacks the power to proceed with a suit unless all necessary parties are properly before the court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 91, 465 S.E.2d at 818. The import of this principle is the fundamental notion that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b816-5\">\u201c \u2018[a necessary party\u2019s] interests in the subject matter of the suit, and in the relief sought, are so bound up with that of the other parties, that their legal presence as parties to the proceeding is an absolute necessity, without which the court cannot proceed.....\u2019\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b816-6\"><em>Id. </em>quoting <em>Bonsal v. Camp, </em>111 Va. 595, 597-98, 69 S.E. 978, 979 (1911) (quoting <em>Barney v. Baltimore City, </em>73 U.S. (6 Wall.) 280, 284, 18 L.Ed. 825 (1867)).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-7\">Thus, the question to be answered in the case at bar is whether a \u201cnecessary\u201d or \u201cindispensable\u201d party must explicitly be named in the notice of appeal to allow the appellate court to \u201cproceed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Based upon our review of the jurisprudence on this issue, we hold that an indispensable party must be named in the notice of appeal in order to properly perfect the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-8\">We first note the Supreme Court of Virginia has held that \u201c[t]he mere fact that an indispensable party who was a litigant in the trial court has notice that an appeal has been perfected against another litigant is not sufficient to confer [an appellate court\u2019s] jurisdiction over the indispensable party against whom no appeal has been properly perfected.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 93, 465 S.E.2d at 819. The facts underlying the <em>Asch </em>decision reveal that the appellants\u2019 notice of appeal \u201cinformed all the litigants below, including the [indispensable party], \u2018that the litigation was not ended and that appeal was in progress.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 90, 465 S.E.2d at 818.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Yet, because the appellants failed to \u201cjoin\u201d an indispensable party as a party in the appeal, the Court held that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>never acquired jurisdiction over the indispensable party and it therefore, dismissed the appeal. <em>Id. </em>at 93, 465 S.E.2d at 819.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">Similarly, in <em>Vaughn v. Vaughn, </em>215 Va. 328, 210 S.E.2d 140 (1974), and <em>Butler v. Butler, </em>219 Va. 164, 247 S.E.2d 353 (1978) <em>(per curiam), </em>the Supreme Court of Virginia refused to consider appeals where indispensable parties were not named in the notices of appeal, nor the petitions for appeal. In <em>Vaughn, </em>the Court refused to hear an appeal involving a lawsuit requesting specific performance of an option to buy a portion of a tract of land. <em>Vaughn, </em>215 Va. at 328, 210 S.E.2d at 141. The Court noted that when the bill of complaint was originally filed, it named as parties-respondents \u201cCarolyn F. Vaughn, Individually and as Administratrix of the Estate of Donald W. Vaughn, Jr.\u201d <em>Id. </em>By letter opinion, incorporating by reference the final decree, the chancellor sustained respondents\u2019 demurrer to the bill. <em>Id. </em>Vaughn was named both individually and as administratrix of the estate in the caption of the letter opinion. <em>Id. </em>at 329, 210 S.E.2d at 141-42. Thus, the letter opinion became binding upon Vaughn, individually, effective with the entry of the final decree. <em>Id. </em>at 329, 210 S.E.2d at 142. Nevertheless, \u201cin the captions of the notice of appeal and assignments of error and the petition for appeal and supersedeas\u201d Vaughn was not named individually. <em>Id. </em>Moreover, \u201cthe notice of appeal and assignments of error,\u201d as well as the \u201cnotice certificate appended to the petition for appeal,\u201d were addressed only to \u201c \u2018Thomas V. Monahan, Esquire, attorney for Carolyn F. Vaughn, Administratrix: of the Estate of Donald W. Vaughn, Jr.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court thus held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-6\">[the][n]otice of appeal and assignments of error must be filed \u201cwithin thirty days after entry of final judgment.\u201d Rule 5:6 [Revised 1985]. That rule, like its predecessor, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>Rule 5:1, \u00a7 4, is mandatory. <em>Mears v. Mears, </em>206 Va. 444, 445, 143 S.E.2d 889, 890 (1965). Petitions for appeal must be presented within four months following final judgment. Code 8-463 [now Code \u00a7 8.01-671]. That rule is jurisdictional. <em>Tharp v. Commonwealth, </em>211 Va. 1, 175 S.E.2d 277 (1970). As to Carolyn F. Vaughn, individually, appellants failed to comply with those rules. Carolyn F. Vaughn, administratrix, is not a party-respondent in interest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b818-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 329-30, 210 S.E.2d at 142. Accordingly, the court found that the appeal was not \u201cperfected according to law,\u201d and it dismissed the appeal \u201cas improvidently awarded.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 330, 210 S.E.2d at 142.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">In <em>Butler, </em>the Court refused to hear an appeal pertaining to a garnishment proceeding. <em>Butler, </em>219 Va. at 165, 247 S.E.2d at 354. In the appeal, the appellant \u201cdid not name the United States in her notice of appeal or serve a copy of her petition for appeal upon the United States.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 166, 247 S.E.2d at 354. Finding that the United States was an indispensable party to the garnishment proceedings, the Court dismissed the appeal, noting the United States was not \u201cbefore [the] Court and [their] mandate could not bind it, a reversal of the trial court\u2019s order would be advisory only, and \u2018courts are not constituted ... to render advisory opinions.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 167, 247 S.E.2d at 355 (quoting <em>City of Fairfax v. Shanklin, </em>205 Va. 227, 229, 135 S.E.2d 773, 775-76 (1964)).</p>\n<p id=\"b818-7\">We have similarly held that an appeal must be dismissed where an appellant \u201cma[de] no reference\u201d to an indispensable party in its notice of appeal. <em>Zion Church Designers &amp; Builders v. McDonald, </em>18 Va.App. 580, 582, 445 S.E.2d 704, 705 (1994). <em>Zion </em>involved an appeal from a workers\u2019 compensation commission award, pursuant to Rule 5A:11.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In the proceedings before the commission, the claimant, who was injured while working on a construction project at First <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>Church of the Nazarene (the Church), joined both the Church and Zion, the company the Church had retained to coordinate and manage the construction project, as parties responsible for payment of benefits. <em>Id. </em>Zion and the Church each denied liability, contending that the claimant was the other\u2019s employee. <em>Id. </em>The commission ultimately found that the claimant was Zion\u2019s employee and awarded the claimant temporary total disability benefits from Zion. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">Zion filed a timely notice of appeal with the clerk of the commission, naming the claimant as appellee, but \u201cmaking no reference to the Church.\u201d <em>Id. </em>More than 30 days after the entry of the award, Zion filed an \u201cAddendum to Notice of Appeal\u201d \u201cadding\u201d the Church as an appellee. <em>Id. </em>Noting that \u201cthe [30-day] time requirement for the filing of a notice of appeal is jurisdictional,\u201d because it \u201cforestalls the finality of the appealed adjudication, notifies the appellee that he cannot rest on his victory, and initiates the time frame of the case in the Court of Appeals,\u201d we held that Zion\u2019s failure to add the Church as an appellee until after the 30-day filing period had expired amounted to Zion\u2019s failure to \u201cgive timely notice of appeal with respect to the Church.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 583, 445 S.E.2d at 705-06. We held that Zion\u2019s failure in this regard \u201crender[ed] its initial notice of appeal ineffective and require[d] dismissal of the appeal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 583, 445 S.E.2d at 706.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">In so holding, we specifically noted that \u201cZion\u2019s failure to name the [party] in its October 8 notice of appeal was not a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>mere failure to perform a directory act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 583-84, 445 S.E.2d at 706 (citing <em>Johnson v. City of Clifton Forge, </em>7 Va.App. 538, 375 S.E.2d 540 (1989) (holding that the \u201cfiling\u201d of a notice of appeal containing the names of the appellees and the names and addresses of their counsel was \u201cnot defeated],\u201d although appellant failed to mail or deliver a copy of the notice to the appellees during the 30-day filing period, because Rule 5A:1(b)(10) is directory rather than mandatory),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>9 Va.App. 376, 388 S.E.2d 654 (1990)). \u201cNeither was it a mere error of internal reference.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Carlton v. Paxton, </em>14 Va.App. 105, 415 S.E.2d 600 (1992) (holding that the court acquired jurisdiction over appeal where notice of appeal was timely filed and properly styled to appeal May 11, 1990 adoption order but erroneously referred to order being appealed as one entered on April 22, 1986), <em>aff'd en banc, </em>15 Va.App. 265, 422 S.E.2d 423 (1992)). \u201cRather, it was a failure to comply with a requirement made mandatory by both statute and rule.\u201d <em>Id.; cf. Greif Companies v. Hensley, </em>22 Va.App. 546, 471 S.E.2d 803 (1996) (holding appeal properly perfected where indispensable party was named in the notice of appeal, but named as an appellant, not as an appellee, and was \u201cpresently before [the] Court\u201d); <em>State Water Control Board v. Crutchfield, </em>265 Va. 416, 424 n. 2, 578 S.E.2d 762, 766 n. 2 (2003) (holding that a circuit court could properly amend a <em>petition for appeal, </em>under Rule 2A:4, to add an indispensable party after the relevant 30-day time limitation had expired, but explicitly declining to \u201caddress any other requirements of Rule 2A:2\u201d pertaining to the petitioners\u2019 notice of appeal, because the parties did not challenge petitioners\u2019 compliance with that Rule).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">Consistent with this line of precedent, we find that an appellant\u2019s failure to name the guardian <em>ad litem, </em>an indis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>pensable party, in either a notice of appeal or an accompanying certificate of service, renders this Court powerless to exercise jurisdiction over that indispensable party. This finding is consistent with the \u201cpurpose behind rules governing a notice of appeal.\u201d <em>Carlton, </em>14 Va.App. at 110, 415 S.E.2d at 602.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b821-5\">As the Supreme Court of Virginia has made plain, these rules have been designed to protect the appellee, not to penalize the appellant. <em>See Avery v. County School Board, </em>192 Va. 329, 333, 64 S.E.2d 767, 770 (1951). If required papers are not timely filed, \u201cthe appellee is entitled to assume that the litigation is ended.... Litigation is a serious and harassing matter, and the right to know when it is ended is a valuable right.\u201d <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b821-6\"><em>Id. </em>In an appeal of right, the appeal is \u201cperfected\u201d by the timely filing of a notice of appeal. <em>See </em>Rule 5A:16(a). Thus, the notice of appeal, when filed, effectively transfers jurisdiction from the lower court to the appellate court and places the named parties within the jurisdiction of the appellate court. <em>See Devondale v. Stallings, </em>795 S.W.2d 954 (Ky.1990); <em>see also Coleman v. Thompson, </em>501 U.S. 722, 742-43, 751, 111 S.Ct. 2546, 2560-61, 115 L.Ed.2d 640 (1991) describing Supreme Court of Virginia Rules 5:5(a) and 5:9, stating \u201cthe notice of appeal is a document filed <em>with the trial court </em>that notifies that court and the [appellate court], <em>as well as the parties, </em>that there will be an appeal; it is a purely ministerial document,\u201d and the purpose of the 30-day limit in Rule 5:5(a) \u201c \u2018 \u201cis to set a definite point of time when litigation should be at an end, unless within that time the prescribed application has been made; and if it has not been, to advise prospective appellees that they are freed of the appellant\u2019s demands\u201d \u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Browder v. Director, Illinois Dept. of Corr., </em>434 U.S. 257, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978) (quoting <em>Matton Steamboat Co. v. Murphy, </em>319 U.S. 412, 63 S.Ct. 1126, 87 L.Ed. 1483 (1943)) (second emphasis added)). It thus stands to reason <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>that a notice of appeal that entirely omits an indispensable party fails to transfer jurisdiction over that party to the appellate court and thus fails to comport with the \u201cpurpose behind rules governing a notice of appeal.\u201d <em>Carlton, </em>14 Va.App. at 110, 415 S.E.2d at 602.

We did not hold in <em>Hughes </em>that a party who entirely omits an indispensable party from his or her notice of appeal or accompanying certificate of service, and fails to cure that defect within the mandatory 30-day filing period, may correct that omission by subsequently providing the indispensable party with a copy of the defective notice and certificate of service, or by providing the indispensable party with a copy of the opening brief.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Indeed, notice, in and of itself that an appeal has been taken is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>insufficient to confer an appellate court with \u201cjurisdiction over the indispensable party against whom no appeal has been properly perfected.\u201d <em>Asch, </em>251 Va. at 93, 465 S.E.2d at 819.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">In <em>M.G., </em>we held that \u201cwe have jurisdiction over both the appeal itself and the guardian <em>ad litem, </em>an indispensable party, <em>as long as the record establishes </em>that, \u2018within 30 days after entry of final judgment or other appealable order or decree, counsel file[d] with the clerk of the trial court a notice of appeal, and at the same time mail[ed] or delivered] a copy of such notice to all opposing counsel....\u2019\u201d 41 Va.App. at 178, 583 S.E.2d at 764-65 (quoting Rule 5A:6(a)) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">Although the facts in <em>M.G. </em>reveal that M.G. failed to name the children\u2019s guardian <em>ad litem </em>in either the notice of appeal or the accompanying certificate, the facts also reveal that M.G. did indicate in the certificate accompanying the notice that \u201c[a] guardian <em>ad litem </em>[had been] appointed for the children.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 175, 583 S.E.2d at 763. Moreover, the issue in that case was not whether the Court lacked jurisdiction over the guardian <em>ad litem </em>because M.G. failed to name the guardian <em>ad litem </em>in either her notice of appeal or accompanying certificate. Instead, the issue raised was whether M.G. \u201c \u2018failfed] to join the children\u2019s guardian <em>ad litem </em>as a party to the case\u2019 because she failed to certify in her notice of appeal that she mailed or delivered a copy of the notice to all opposing counsel, i.e., the children\u2019s guardian <em>ad litem.\u201d Id. </em>at 176, 583 S.E.2d at 763-64.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-7\">Noting that \u201c[w]e have never held ...

This requirement clearly must be satisfied within the 30-day \u201cmandatory\u201d filing period. Rules 5A:3; 5A:16. Otherwise, the notice is \u201cineffective\u201d and the appeal is never properly perfected. <em>Zion, </em>18 Va.App. at 583, 445 S.E.2d at 706; <em>Vaughn, </em>215 Va. at 330, 210 S.E.2d at 142. In sum, notwithstanding the fact that this Court possesses jurisdiction over the subject matter of the appeal, the failure to file a notice of appeal in compliance with this mandate, within the requisite 30-day period, necessarily affects this Court\u2019s authority to exercise that jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>In the case at bar, this requirement was clearly not satisfied. Specifically, because Watkins failed to name an indispensable party in her notice of appeal or accompanying certificate of service within the 30-day mandatory filing period, this Court never obtained jurisdiction over the person of that party during that time period. Watkins, thus, failed to properly perfect her appeal within the mandatory 30-day time limitation. <em>See </em>Rule 5A:3(a); Rule 5A:6; <em>Asch, </em>251 Va. at 91, 465 S.E.2d at 818 (noting that a court lacks the power to proceed with a suit unless all necessary parties are properly before the court).</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">Because the time requirement for filing a notice of appeal, in accord with Rule 5A:6, is mandatory, we find that we must dismiss Watkins\u2019s appeal. <em>See </em>Rule 5A:3. Watkins\u2019s failure to timely file a notice of appeal, in compliance with the most basic of our rules, renders her notice, and thus her attempt to properly perfect her appeal, ineffective. <em>Zion, </em>18 Va.App. at 583, 445 S.E.2d at 706; <em>see also Williams v.
