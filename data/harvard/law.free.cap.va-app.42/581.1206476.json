On appeal, Sykes contends the trial court erred in applying Code \u00a7 18.2-183\u2019s evidentiary presumption of fraudulent intent to him because the checks he wrote in this case were drawn on closed, rather than nonexistent, bank accounts. Finding no error, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-13\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b634-14\">The relevant facts in this case are undisputed. Between November 5, 1999, and March 18, 2000, Sykes, using accounts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>at three different banks, wrote five checks that were each returned unpaid by the drawee bank to the merchant to whom it had been written. Each returned check was marked \u201cAccount Closed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">Sykes was indicted by the grand jury for issuing each of the five unpaid checks, third or subsequent offense of larceny, in violation of Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-181 and 18.2-104. At trial, Sykes, who presented no evidence, moved, following the presentation of the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence, to strike the five charges, contending the Commonwealth had failed to prove he had the requisite intent to defraud. He argued only that the presumption of fraudulent intent under Code \u00a7 18.2-183 did not apply to him because he had written the unpaid checks on banks with which he had a closed account, rather than on banks with which he had \u201cno account.\u201d Determining that Code \u00a7 18.2-183\u2019s evidentiary presumption of fraudulent intent applied to checks drawn on a closed bank account, the trial court denied Sykes\u2019s motion and subsequently convicted him of the five charged offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">In relevant part, Code \u00a7 18.2-183 provides that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-9\">[w]hen a check is drawn on a bank in which the maker or drawer has no account, it shall be presumed that such check was issued with intent to defraud, and the five-day notice [to the maker or drawer of the check that the check was not paid by the bank, which is otherwise necessary to trigger the statute\u2019s presumption of intent to defraud,] shall not be required in such case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b635-10\">On appeal, Sykes does not dispute that he wrote the five bad checks at issue in this case on bank accounts that were closed. He contends, however, that the trial court improperly relied upon the presumption of fraudulent intent under Code \u00a7 18.2-183 to convict him of issuing the five bad checks, because that presumption expressly arises only \u201c[w]hen a check is drawn on a bank in which the maker or drawer has no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>account,\u201d and not, as in this case, when a check is drawn on a closed account. Writing a check on a closed account, he argues, \u201cmust be distinguished,\u201d under the statute, from writing a check on a bank in which the writer has \u201cno account,\u201d because, unlike a check written on a nonexistent account, a check written on a closed account \u201csimply does not demonstrate on its face that the drawer intended to defraud.\u201d This is so, he argues, because a check writer\u2019s bank account could be closed, through no fault of his own, without his knowledge. Moreover, he argues further, unlike persons having no account, \u201cholders of closed accounts could have credit with the bank.\u201d The legislature, he asserts, considered the difference between writing a check on a closed account and on a nonexistent account so substantial that, despite specifically referencing both types of account in Code \u00a7 18.2-184, it intentionally omitted the writing of checks on a closed account from operation of the presumption of fraudulent intent contained in Code \u00a7 18.2-183. Accordingly, he concludes, the trial court erred in determining that Code \u00a7 18.2-183\u2019s presumption of intent to defraud applies to one who writes a check on a closed account.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">In response, the Commonwealth argues that, in accordance with the plain meaning and purpose of Code \u00a7 18.2-183, a bank account that has been closed is subsumed within the meaning of \u201cno account.\u201d Therefore, the Commonwealth concludes, the trial court properly employed the statute\u2019s presumption of intent to defraud in finding Sykes guilty of issuing the five bad checks, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-181.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">A conviction under Code \u00a7 18.2-181 requires proof of, among other things, \u201cthe fraudulent intent of the drawer of the check.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Sylvestre v. Commonwealth, </em>10 Va.App. 253, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>258, 391 S.E.2d 336, 339 (1990): <em>see also Bray v. Commonwealth, </em>9 Va.App. 417, 422, 388 S.E.2d 837, 839 (1990) (noting that \u201cthe gravamen of the offense\u201d set forth in Code \u00a7 18.2-181 is \u201cthe intent to defraud\u201d). \u201cSuch intent is an indispensable element of the crime and the burden is upon the Commonwealth to prove its existence at the time of drawing or uttering the check.\u201d <em>Bray, </em>9 Va.App. at 422, 388 S.E.2d at 839. In recognition of the difficulty faced by the Commonwealth in proving the requisite fraudulent intent in cases such as this, Code \u00a7 18.2-183 defines \u201ca rule of evidence upon which the Commonwealth may rely in facilitating proof of the fraudulent intent of the drawer.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 423, 388 S.E.2d at 840. Under Code \u00a7 18.2-183, the Commonwealth is able to avail itself of a presumption of the drawer\u2019s intent to defraud by showing that the refused check at issue was \u201cdrawn on a bank in which the maker or drawer ha[d] no account.\u201d Hence, once the Commonwealth proves that a check was \u201cdrawn on a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>bank in which the maker or drawer ha[d] no account,\u201d the fact finder can infer that the drawer of the check had the requisite intent to defraud. However, the presumption is rebuttable, and, thus, merely serves \u201cto put the burden on the defendant to introduce evidence to explain or excuse.\u201d <em>Johnson v. Commonwealth, </em>188 Va. 848, 855, 51 S.E.2d 152, 155 (1949); <em>see Patterson v. Commonwealth, </em>216 Va. 306, 308, 218 S.E.2d 435, 436 (1975) (stating that the same presumption set forth in the predecessor statute to Code \u00a7 18.2-183 is rebuttable); <em>cf. Bagheri v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 1071, 1074, 408 S.E.2d 259, 262 (1991) (noting that the presumption invoked pursuant to similar provisions of Code \u00a7 18.2-183 is rebuttable).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">Here, the evidence presented at trial proved that Sykes wrote five checks that were refused by the respective drawee banks for lack of funds. Each returned check was marked \u201cAccount Closed.\u201d Relying on the presumption of fraudulent intent set forth in Code \u00a7 18.2-183, which was not rebutted by Sykes, the trial court found Sykes guilty of issuing each of the five bad checks, in violation of Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-181 and 18.2-104.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">The sole issue on appeal is whether the trial court properly employed Code \u00a7 18.2-183\u2019s presumption of fraudulent intent in finding Sykes guilty of issuing the five bad checks. Specifically, we must determine whether the term \u201cno account\u201d in Code \u00a7 18.2-183 includes, within the meaning of that statute, a bank account that has been closed. For the reasons that follow, we hold that it does.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">In accordance with basic principles of statutory construction, \u201c \u2018[w]hen a statute is plain and unambiguous, a court may look only to the words of the statute to determine its meaning.\u2019 \u201d <em>Caprio v. Commonwealth, </em>254 Va. 507, 511-12, 493 S.E.2d 371, 374 (1997) (quoting <em>Harrison &amp; Bates, Inc. v. Featherstone Assoc., </em>253 Va. 364, 368, 484 S.E.2d 883, 885 (1997)). \u201cNon-technieal words in statutes are taken to have been used in their ordinary sense and acceptation.\u201d <em>Bd. of Supervisors v. Boaz, </em>176 Va. 126, 130, 10 S.E.2d 498, 499 (1940). \u201cThe manifest intention of the legislature, clearly disclosed by its language, must be applied.\u201d <em>Anderson v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number><em>Commonwealth, </em>182 Va. 560, 566, 29 S.E.2d 838, 841 (1944). Accordingly, \u201cwe will not apply \u2018an unreasonably restrictive interpretation of the statute\u2019 that would subvert the legislative intent expressed therein.\u201d <em>Armstrong v. Commonwealth, </em>263 Va. 573, 581, 562 S.E.2d 139, 144 (2002) (quoting <em>Ansell v. Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 759, 761, 250 S.E.2d 760, 761 (1979)).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">The language of Code \u00a7 18.2-183 at issue here is plain and unambiguous, and clearly manifests the legislature\u2019s intent that a defendant who writes a check on a bank in which he does not have an account is subject to the rebuttable presumption that he wrote that check with the intent to defraud. In ascertaining whether writing a check on an account that has been closed is equivalent, within the statute\u2019s meaning, to writing a check on a bank in which the check writer does not have an account, we observe that the Supreme Court has previously noted, in an opinion interpreting the predecessor statute to Code \u00a7 18.2-183, that \u201c[tjhere is no distinction between a checking account which does not exist and one which has been closed.\u201d <em>Patterson, </em>216 Va. at 308 n. 1, 218 S.E.2d at 436 n. 1. Although the Court\u2019s statement is arguably dictum, its correctness is undeniable.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">Common sense and reason dictate that a \u201cclosed account\u201d is an account that, for all practical purposes, no longer exists. In common parlance, the verb \u201cclose\u201d means \u201cto bring to an end ... or preclude further continuation of.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>1914 (1993). In the legal context, \u201cclose\u201d means \u201c[t]o finish, bring to an end, conclude, terminate, complete, wind up; as, to \u2018close\u2019 an account.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>254 (6th ed.1990). Accordingly, a closed account is one that has been ended and, thus, has ceased to exist, except perhaps in an historical sense as a former account. Indeed, a reasonable person attempting to cash a check at a bank in which his account had been closed would have to respond, if asked by a bank teller if he had an account at that bank, that he used to have an account at the bank, but not anymore. He could not rationally say he still had an account with the bank. We conclude, therefore, that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>once an account with a bank is closed, there is \u201cno account,\u201d within the meaning of Code \u00a7 18.2-183.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Consequently, when a check is written on an account that has been closed, it is drawn on \u201cno account.\u201d Hence, if the Commonwealth proves that a check was drawn on a closed account, the fact finder can infer under Code \u00a7 18.2-183 that the drawer of the check had the requisite intent to defraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">Sykes points out that there could be instances in which a person might unwittingly write a check on an account that he did not know had been closed. As previously mentioned, however, the presumption of fraudulent intent arising under Code \u00a7 18.2-183 is rebuttable. Thus, when a court is presented with evidence that the defendant has written a check on a closed account, the defendant is afforded the opportunity to offer evidence to show that the check was not written with fraudulent intent. <em>See Patterson, </em>216 Va. at 308, 218 S.E.2d at 436. Here, Sykes offered no evidence at trial to rebut the statutory presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">Sykes further points out that the term \u201caccount closed\u201d appears in Code \u00a7 18.2-184 but not in Code \u00a7 18.2-183. Citing the rule of statutory interpretation stated in <em>Williams v. Matthews, </em>248 Va. 277, 284, 448 S.E.2d 625, 629 (1994), that, \u201c[w]hen a statute contains a given provision with reference to one subject, the omission of such provision from a similar statute dealing with a related subject is significant to show the existence of a different legislative intent,\u201d he argues the omission of the term \u201caccount closed\u201d in Code \u00a7 18.2-183 demonstrates the legislature\u2019s intent to exclude the act of writing a check on a closed account from operation of the presumption of fraudulent intent contained in that statute. Sykes\u2019s reliance on the rule in <em>Williams </em>is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">Code \u00a7 18.2-184 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>In any prosecution or action under the preceding sections, any notation attached to or stamped upon a check, draft or order which is refused by the drawee because of lack of funds or credit, bearing the terms \u201cnot sufficient funds,\u201d \u201cuncollected funds,\u201d \u201caccount closed,\u201d or \u201cno account in this name,\u201d or words of similar import, shall be prima facie evidence that such notation is true and correct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">Code \u00a7 18.2-184 is a rule of evidence that, in conjunction with Code \u00a7 18.2-183, aids the Commonwealth in proving a drawer\u2019s fraudulent intent in cases like this. It allows proof of the lack of funds in an account or the absence of an account to be established simply by the language of the drawee bank\u2019s stamp on a check identifying the reason the check was refused. As listed in Code \u00a7 18.2-184, the terms \u201cnot sufficient funds\u201d and \u201cuncollected funds\u201d both indicate that the cheek was refused by the drawee because there were insufficient funds in the existing account upon which the check was drawn to cover the check. Such evidence, if unrebutted, would invoke the presumption prescribed in the first paragraph of Code \u00a7 18.2-183. Conversely, the terms \u201caccount closed\u201d and \u201cno account in this name\u201d both indicate that the cheek was refused because the account upon which the check was drawn did not exist. That evidence would give rise, if unrebutted, to the presumption at issue here, which is set forth in the last paragraph of Code \u00a7 18.2-183. Thus, rather than showing that the legislature intended to exclude closed accounts from the operation of Code \u00a7 18.2-183\u2019s presumption of fraudulent intent, as Sykes claims, the language of Code \u00a7 18.2-184 clearly places one who writes a check on a closed account within the scope of Code \u00a7 18.2-183. \u201cProvisions in one act which are omitted in another on the same subject matter will be applied when the purposes of the two acts are consistent.\u201d 2B Norman J. Singer, <em>Statutes and Statutory Construction </em>\u00a7 51.02 (6th ed.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">Lastly, Sykes asserts that one who has a closed account could still be extended credit by the bank based on that account. Sykes, however, points to no evidence in the record, and we find none, to support that assertion. Clearly, though, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>if that were to occur in a particular case, the defendant could simply present evidence of it to rebut the presumption arising under Code \u00a7 18.2-183. Here, as previously stated, Sykes offered no evidence to rebut the presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">For these reasons, we hold that the trial court properly applied the rebuttable presumption of Code \u00a7 18.2-183 in finding Sykes guilty of issuing the five bad checks. Accordingly, we affirm Sykes\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b636-7\">.
