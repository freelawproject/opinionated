Wheeler (father) appeals from a decision of the circuit court permitting the out-of-state relocation of his chil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>dren with Cathleen N. Wheeler (mother). Father contends that the trial court erred in: (1) finding that relocation was in the children\u2019s best interests, would not substantially impair their relationship with father, and would improve their economic circumstances; (2) allowing relocation out-of-state rather than requiring it locally; and, (3) failing to properly consider the testimony of a witness. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">\u2018We review the evidence in the light most favorable to mother, the party prevailing below, and grant her all reasonable inferences fairly deducible from the evidence viewed in that light.\u201d <em>Goodhand v. Kildoo, </em>37 Va.App. 591, 595, 560 S.E.2d 463, 464 (2002). Mother and father were married in 1988. Three children were born of the marriage, now ages eleven, seven and four. Because father was in the military, the family lived in numerous locations in Europe and the United States. Due to his job, father also traveled extensively, resulting in mother and children staying with family in Connecticut for several-month stretches at a time.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">In April 1996, father took an assignment in Northern Virginia and moved the family to a house in Fairfax. Neither mother nor father had any family or friends in the area. In June 1998, one month after mother became pregnant with their youngest child, the family relocated to another home in Fairfax.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-8\">In August 1998, father left the family home and separated from wife. The parties entered into a Property Settlement Agreement that provided for joint custody of the children. Physical custody was placed with mother, while father had visitation on alternate weekends, a mid-week evening, holidays, two weeks in the summer, and other times as the parties agreed. The agreement also provided that mother and father would discuss, in advance, any material decision relating to the children\u2019s health, education, religious training and social welfare. Father agreed to pay monthly child support. He also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>agreed to pay monthly spousal support, which by agreement would be gradually reduced starting in 2005 and extinguished in 2008. According to the agreement, the spousal support is non-modifiable and remarriage is excluded as a basis for its termination. Father contends this provision was made to enable mother to continue to reside in Northern Virginia and stay home with the children. A final decree of divorce was entered on June 1, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">Mother and the three children remained in the family\u2019s home until June 2000. When mother was unable to afford the rent, they moved to a townhouse in Burke, Virginia. Because of the generosity of the property manager, mother initially paid reduced rent.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">In September 2000, father remarried. At the time of the hearing, he and new wife had one child age twenty months, and were expecting a second child. Father and new family live in a small, single-family house in Arlington, Virginia.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">After the divorce, mother experienced deteriorating financial circumstances. Her rent steadily increased, and she drew on her savings in order to adequately cover living expenses for the children. By the time of the hearing, her savings were depleted. She also depended on charity and gifts from family and friends to cover the family\u2019s expenses. At one point, for approximately a year, she worked part-time outside the home, making $15 per hour. After determining that the financial benefit was negligible and insufficient, mother ceased making an effort to seek outside employment. Because of the rent increases, by June 2002, mother and children were again required to look for another suitable residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">Toward the end of 2000, mother began a relationship with Wade Luther. Luther moved from Orlando, Florida to Northern Virginia in 1995, to attend law school. He has two children from a previous marriage, ages eleven and nine. In March 2002, Luther proposed marriage to mother contingent on her moving to Florida with him. Mother initially told Luther she could not move to Florida because she wanted to keep the children near their father. However, once she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>evaluated what she could afford in the Northern Virginia housing market and the economic condition of the family, she decided that it was in the best interests of the children to relocate to Florida with Luther.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">In May 2002, mother informed father that she and the children would be moving to Florida with Luther. Father objected to the move and filed a petition to enjoin out-of-state relocation on July 3, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">According to witnesses at an <em>ore terms </em>hearing, the children are happy, well-adjusted, in good health and perform well academically. Both parties testified that the other is an excellent parent and that each has a close, warm, loving and caring relationship with the children. Several witnesses testified that both mother and father are active, involved parents. Father testified that if the children were permitted to relocate with mother, he would not be able to have the spontaneous contact he enjoys with the children in Northern Virginia. One of father\u2019s witnesses, Dr. Alan McFarland, a licensed clinical psychologist, opined that physical proximity of a parent to a child is essential to the fundamental ambitions of the co-parenting model. Father also presented a real estate agent who introduced real estate listings for properties in Northern Virginia that were possibly in mother\u2019s price range. Mother countered with exhibits of real estate listings that showed properties in Florida that were substantially better than those available in Northern Virginia and that she might be able to afford.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">At the conclusion of the hearing, the chancellor found that there was a material change in circumstances, specifically as to the economic condition of the custodial parent. The chancellor then considered the best interests of the children, separately addressed each of the factors in Code \u00a7 20-124.3, and found the relocation to be in the best interests of the children. He also found, because of father\u2019s bond with the children, the absence of physical proximity would not change the father\u2019s relationship with them, though it might be an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>inconvenience. He stated that it was \u201cnot in the best interest of the children to retain the status quo because the status quo [was] changing and [would] continue to change because of the deteriorating economic situation.\u201d On December 17, 2002, the trial court entered an order permitting relocation of the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">A. RELOCATION</p>\n<p id=\"Aa\">1. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">When a court hears evidence at an <em>ore terms </em>hearing, its decision is entitled to great weight and will not be disturbed on appeal unless plainly wrong or without evidence to support it. <em>Piatt v. Piatt, </em>27 Va.App. 426, 432, 499 S.E.2d 567, 570 (1998). A court may \u201cfrom time to time ... revise and alter [a] decree concerning the care, custody and maintenance of ... children and make a new decree concerning the same, as circumstances of the parents and the benefit of the children may require.\u201d Code \u00a7 20-108; <em>Bostick v. Bostick-Bennett, </em>23 Va.App. 527, 534-35, 478 S.E.2d 319, 323 (1996). A court may forbid a custodial parent from removing children from the state without the court\u2019s permission, or it may permit the children to be removed from the state. <em>Scinaldi v. Scinaldi, </em>2 Va.App. 571, 573, 347 S.E.2d 149, 150 (1986). In determining whether to modify a decree giving a custodial parent permission to remove children from the state, the court must find: (1) a material change in circumstances since the prior decree; and, (2) that relocation would be in the children\u2019s best interests. <em>Bostick, </em>23 Va.App. at 535, 478 S.E.2d at 323; <em>see also </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 20-108 and 20-124.3. Additionally, \u201cthe added difficulty in maintaining a beneficial relationship between a child and a non-custodial parent should not be the sole basis for restricting a custodial parent\u2019s residence except where the benefits of the relationship cannot be substantially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>maintained if the child is moved away from the non-custodial parent.\u201d <em>Scinaldi, </em>2 Va.App. at 575, 347 S.E.2d at 151.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">2. CHANGED CIRCUMSTANCES</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">Before evaluating whether to modify a decree, the court must find a material change in circumstances. <em>See Hughes v. Gentry, </em>18 Va.App. 318, 321, 443 S.E.2d 448, 450 (1994); <em>Hiner v. Hadeed, </em>15 Va.App. 575, 579-80, 425 S.E.2d 811, 814 (1993) (\u201cIn the absence of a material change in circumstance, reconsideration ... would be barred by principles of res judicata.\u201d); <em>Turner v. Turner, </em>3 Va.App. 31, 35, 348 S.E.2d 21, 23 (1986). Accordingly, as a threshold matter, the trial court properly found that there had been a material change in circumstances such that the court could modify a decree giving the custodial parent permission to remove children from the state. \u201c \u2018Changed circumstances\u2019 is a broad concept and incorporates a broad range of positive and negative developments in the lives of the children.\u201d <em>Parish v. Spaulding, </em>26 Va.App. 566, 573, 496 S.E.2d 91, 94 (1998) (quoting <em>Keel v. Keel, </em>225 Va. 606, 611-12, 303 S.E.2d 917, 921 (1983)), <em>aff'd, </em>257 Va. 357, 513 S.E.2d 391 (1999). \u201cWhether a change in circumstances exists is a factual finding that will not be disturbed on appeal if the finding is supported by credible evidence.\u201d <em>Ohlen v. Shively, </em>16 Va.App. 419, 423, 430 S.E.2d 559, 561 (1993) (citation omitted). The trial court found that \u201cplainly\u201d there had been a change in circumstances since the initial order was entered in the case, specifically, the change in the mother\u2019s economic circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>3. BEST INTERESTS OF THE CHILDREN</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">Once the court determines that there has been a material change in circumstances, it must evaluate whether relocation would be in the best interests of the children. \u201cSuch a decision is a matter of discretion to be exercised by the court, and, unless plainly wrong or without evidence to support it, the court\u2019s decree must be affirmed.\u201d <em>Bostick, </em>23 Va.App. at 533, 478 S.E.2d at 322. \u201cIt is well settled in Virginia that the best interests of the children controls the issue of a change of custody or the issue of a custodial parent moving the children to another state.\u201d <em>Simmons v. Simmons, </em>1 Va.App. 358, 362, 339 S.E.2d 198, 200 (1986); <em>see also Stockdale v. Stockdale, </em>33 Va.App. 179, 183, 532 S.E.2d 332, 335 (2000); <em>Bostick, </em>23 Va.App. at 535, 478 S.E.2d at 323. \u201cThe court may consider a benefit to the parent from relocation only if the move independently benefits the children.\u201d <em>Cloutier v. Queen, </em>35 Va.App. 413, 430, 545 S.E.2d 574, 583 (2001).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">In <em>Sullivan v. Knick, </em>38 Va.App. 773, 568 S.E.2d 430 (2002), this Court denied a custodial parent permission to remove a child from the state, finding that the evidence in the case established that the proposed relocation only benefited the mother and was not in the best interests of the children. The Court found that a decision to disturb the \u201cstatus quo\u201d was plainly wrong and unsupported by the evidence. In the case at bar, the chancellor found that the relocation not only benefited mother, but was \u201cin fact beneficial and in the best interests of the children.\u201d He stated that relocation from the children\u2019s current home was going to happen regardless and that relocation within Northern Virginia would be \u201cof no benefit whatsoever.\u201d The court found that there was no \u201cstatus quo\u201d because of the deteriorating economic situation of the family. In this case, unlike in the <em>Sullivan </em>case, the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>found that the proposed relocation did not solely reflect the preferences of the custodial parent, but was clearly beneficial to the children. The most distinguishing thing about <em>Sullivan </em>is that, during the relocation hearing, the mother\u2019s new husband admitted that the \u201c \u2018prime motivation\u2019 for pursuing the move was to locate nearer the South Carolina residence of his eight-year-old son from a prior marriage, thereby affording him \u2018more involve[ment]\u2019 in the child\u2019s life.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 778, 568 S.E.2d at 433. The requested relocation, therefore, \u201cwas prompted solely by mother\u2019s marriage\u201d and her new husband\u2019s \u201cdesire to pursue employment and residence in South Carolina to be nearer his child by a prior marriage....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 784, 568 S.E.2d at 435.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">A trial court may consider a benefit to the custodial parent from relocation so long as the \u201cmove independently benefits the children.\u201d <em>Cloutier, </em>35 Va.App. at 430, 545 S.E.2d at 583. To be sure, as we acknowledged in <em>Sullivan, </em>\u201cadvantages accruing to a custodial parent from relocation oftentimes inure to the benefit of a child\u201d and should be taken into account. <em>Sullivan, </em>38 Va.App. at 784, 568 S.E.2d at 436.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">Father argues that the court\u2019s conclusion that mother and children will be in a better economic situation upon a move to Florida is based on speculation and not supported by any evidence in the record. He states that as of the date of hearing, mother was not married to Luther, neither she nor Luther owned a home in Florida, and that Luther had no employment in Florida. In <em>Carpenter v. Carpenter, </em>220 Va. 299, 257 S.E.2d 845 (1979), an unemployed custodial parent sought to move to New York with her children in order to seek employment opportunities. The trial court enjoined her from moving, finding that the move was not in the best interests of the children. That court found that both parents were fit and enjoyed good relationships with the children, that the children were developing well and that the mother\u2019s prospects for employment were speculative and \u201cfanciful.\u201d The Supreme Court of Virginia affirmed the decision because there was evidence to support the trial court\u2019s finding that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>best interests of the children would not be served by the move.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">In the case at bar, as in <em>Carpenter, </em>the chancellor found that both parents were fit and enjoyed good relationships with the children and that the children were developing well. However, unlike in <em>Carpenter, </em>the chancellor found that it was in the children\u2019s best interests to move to Florida. The court found that relocation to Florida would provide stability for the children, unlike in Northern Virginia. He found that the children would have a support system, which they do not have in Northern Virginia. And, he found that the children\u2019s economic situation would improve; better housing at more affordable prices would be available in Florida, unlike in Northern Virginia. Also, unlike in <em>Carpenter, </em>mother was not seeking job opportunities out-of-state. She stayed at home with the children while she was living in Northern Virginia, and would be able to stay at home with the children upon a move to Florida. The court stated that the children\u2019s ability to stay with the primary caregiver, \u201cis of great benefit to them as well. They will have a stay-at-home mother. That status would be in jeopardy otherwise. She simply cannot do so in Northern Virginia.\u201d The court weighed the benefits to the children of staying in Northern Virginia against allowing a move to Florida. It found that the situation in Northern Virginia would have a negative impact on the children while the move to Florida would have a positive impact. This Court cannot say that such a finding is plainly wrong or without evidence to support it.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">We turn now to reviewing whether, in fact, the evidence supports the trial court\u2019s finding that the relocation was in the best interests of the children. In determining the best interests of the children, the court must look at the factors provided by Code \u00a7 20-124.3.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Cloutier, </em>35 Va.App. at 427, 545 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>S.E.2d at 581; <em>see also Goodhand, </em>37 Va.App. at 600, 560 S.E.2d at 467; <em>Stockdale, </em>33 Va.App. at 181-82, 532 S.E.2d at 334. In the instant case, the chancellor stated that he considered the testimony of all the witnesses and exhibits in considering the factors. He then communicated his specific findings on each factor. At the conclusion of the hearing, he reiterated his findings, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-5\">Simply put it is the conclusion of the Court that the best interest of the children will be served by permitting their relocation with their mother. Their economic circumstances will improve. They will have financial security. They will have a suitable and stable home environment. They will not be living on the edge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-6\">Secondly, they will remain with their primary caregiver. This is of great benefit to them as well. They will have a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>stay-at-home mother. That status would be in jeopardy otherwise. She simply cannot do so in Northern Virginia. They will enjoy a support system in Florida through the Mother which they do not have available here, both with their maternal grandmother relocating there and with the step-siblings that will become part of the family, the nuclear family because of marriage to Mr. Luther.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-5\">Thirdly, ... it is not in the best interest of these children to retain the status quo because the status quo is changing and will continue to change because of the deteriorating economic situation. There is not going to be a status quo. Put differently, relocation is going to occur if not to Florida then to Prince William to Manassas Park or elsewhere. And this is not going to be, given the evidence, which has been presented to the Court, beneficial for these children. And that relocation to Manassas Park, Prince William, for example, will impact on the visitation enjoyed by Mr. Wheeler; it will make it more difficult. That will be a negative for these children. It will be of no benefit whatsoever to the contrary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-6\">The Florida relocation on the other hand for the reasons stated is in fact beneficial and in the best interests of the children.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">Clearly then, the court weighed and considered each of the statutory factors, and concluded from credible evidence that the economic circumstances and living situation of the children would improve and that relocation to Florida was in the best interests of the children. Accordingly, we find that the court did not err in finding that it was in the best interests of the children to relocate.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-8\">4. SUBSTANTIAL MAINTENANCE OF RELATIONSHIP</p>\n<p id=\"b344-9\">Father contends the trial court erred in finding that the relocation will not substantially impair the relationship between father and the children, even through the \u201cgreat weight\u201d of the evidence supported the conclusion that father is an outstanding parent, closely involved in the children\u2019s lives. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>The evidence clearly showed that father is an exceptional parent. However, the issue is not whether father is devoted to his children, but whether, instead, the benefit of the relationship can continue upon the children\u2019s relocation to Florida. <em>See Scinaldi </em>2 Va.App. at 575, 347 S.E.2d at 151. The question the court must answer is whether the benefit is available to the children only if they live in close proximity to the non-custodial parent. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">In this case, the trial court found that father has a \u201cclose, loving relationship with his children. He is bonded to these children. He is bound to these children. And this bond is not going to be broken, indeed it probably will not suffer although it [may be] inconvenienced should the children relocate.\u201d While the beneficial relationship between the children and the parent must not be placed at risk to the disadvantage of the children, <em>Sullivan, </em>38 Va.App. at 783, 568 S.E.2d at 435, the trial court found that the children are not going to be placed at risk of losing the beneficial relationship they enjoy with their father by moving to Florida. This conclusion was not plainly wrong or without evidence to support it. Accordingly, we find that the trial court properly considered the issue and that the evidence supports the trial court\u2019s finding that father\u2019s relationship with the children will not be substantially impaired by the relocation.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">B. TESTIMONY OF DR. McFARLAND</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">Father complains that the trial court erred in failing to give credit to the unrebutted testimony of Dr. Alan McFarland. Dr. McFarland testified that \u201cphysical proximity is essential to the fundamental ambitions of a co-parenting model.\u201d He further said, \u201cIt certainly serves them better.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">In <em>Morris v. Badger Powhatan/Figgie Int'l, Inc., </em>3 Va.App. 276, 279, 348 S.E.2d 876, 877 (1986), we stated, \u201cThe trier of fact must determine the weight of the testimony and the credibility of the witnesses, but it may not arbitrarily disregard uncontradicted evidence of unimpeached witnesses which is not inherently incredible and not inconsistent with facts in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>the record.\u201d \u201cThe evidence of an expert witness should be given the same consideration as is given that of any other witness, considering his opportunity for knowledge of the subject and subject matter as to which he testifies, his appearance, conduct, and demeanor on the stand.\u201d <em>McLane v. Commonwealth, </em>202 Va. 197, 206, 116 S.E.2d 274, 281 (1960). However, the fact finder is not required to accept the testimony of an expert witness merely because he or she has qualified as an expert. <em>Id. </em>at 205-06, 116 S.E.2d at 281.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">In this case, the trial court did not reject the testimony of Dr. McFarland. The chancellor stated that nothing in the doctor\u2019s expert testimony \u201csuggested that the absence of physical proximity would change the Father\u2019s relationship, the relationship of love between the parent and child as a result of a greater distance between them.\u201d Therefore, the chancellor clearly considered the testimony of Dr. McFarland and weighed the testimony accordingly. For that reason, we find no error on the part of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">We hold that the trial court considered the required factors when determining whether to permit relocation: material change of circumstances, best interests of the children and substantial maintenance of the children\u2019s relationship with the non-custodial parent. The court found that there was a material change in circumstances warranting the re-evaluation of the initial custody order. It gave paramount importance to the best interests of the children, weighed all the factors as required by the applicable statutes, and found that relocation was in the best interests of the children. The court also weighed whether relocation would substantially impair the relationship between the children and the non-custodial parent. It found that the strength of the bond between father and the children was so strong that while distance may cause some inconvenience, their relationship could be substantially maintained. Accordingly, we affirm the decision of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b339-7\">. Whether mother might have been able to find and afford a suitable place to live in Northern Virginia, such as Prince William County or Manassas, as posed by father\u2019s Question Presented 5, is not a consideration that is required. What is required is whether there has been a material change in circumstances and whether the relocation is in the best interests of the children. The court must also look at whether the relationship with the non-custodial parent will be substantially impaired. <em>Goodhand, </em>37 Va.App. at 602, 560 S.E.2d at 468; <em>see also Sullivan v. Knick, </em>38 Va.App. 773, 783, 568 S.E.2d 430, 435 (2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b340-6\">. Father contends that the trial court gave priority to the convenience and needs of the mother instead of giving primary consideration to the welfare of the children. This is simply not the case.
