He was sentenced to 10 years in prison with seven years and ten months suspended. Prior to trial, his motion to suppress the evidence was denied. He appeals his convictions based on claims of insufficient evidence and the court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress. For the following reasons, we affirm Copeland\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-9\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b480-10\">On appeal, we review the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, granting it all reasonable inferences deducible from that evidence. <em>Commonwealth v. Grimstead, </em>12 Va.App. 1066, 1067, 407 S.E.2d 47, 48 (1991). So viewed, the evidence establishes that on May 10, 2002, Portsmouth Police Detective David Lodge observed a car at approximately 2:46 p.m. travelling west on High Street. The car began to enter the center median of the roadway as it approached him. One of the car\u2019s tires struck the curb and was punctured. The driver nonetheless continued traveling, making a left turn into opposing traffic on Queen Street, a one-way street. Lodge engaged his emergency equipment and followed the vehicle in order to assist the driver. After travelling several feet in the wrong direction, the driver suddenly put the car in reverse and backed onto Court Street in front of Lodge\u2019s vehicle. The car then traveled across <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>Court Street and turned right, entering the parking lot of the Court Street Baptist Church and Academy.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">Lodge entered the parking lot from the opposite direction to block the car\u2019s exit. The driver of the car drove up to \u201cthe nose\u201d of Lodge\u2019s vehicle, suddenly turned into a parking spot, quickly exited, and began to \u201cwalk away in a very brisk manner.\u201d Lodge exited his car and apprehended the driver. When he detected the odor of alcohol, Lodge walked the driver to the front of the driver\u2019s car where he placed him in handcuffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">Copeland was seated in the front passenger seat of the car where he remained while the above events transpired. While Lodge was placing the driver in handcuffs in front of the car, he saw Copeland reach \u201cin the area of his pocket several times.\u201d Lodge called for a back-up unit and ordered Copeland \u201cto keep his hands up where [Lodge] could see them.\u201d Copeland continually reached \u201cback down toward his right side\u201d and refused to make his hands visible. Lodge testified that he \u201cgot very loud with [Copeland] and instructed him four more times to keep his hands where [Lodge] could see them and to stop going into his pockets.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">After Copeland refused to comply, Lodge drew his service weapon and, without effect, pointed it at Copeland through the windshield. Lodge testified that, \u201ceven after pointing a weapon at him, identifying myself as a police officer and telling him to keep his hands out of his pocket and to keep them where I could see them,\u201d Copeland did not comply. Copeland continued to \u201cgo into his right pocket and to the right side of his body.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b481-8\">When Portsmouth Police Officer C.A. Gilmore arrived, Lodge directed him to search Copeland\u2019s right pocket. Gilmore reached directly into Copeland\u2019s pants pocket and found two bags containing an off-white substance in the small watch/ change pocket. Gilmore handcuffed Copeland and placed him in custody at that time. Lodge then walked around the car and observed a bag, which he suspected contained cocaine, located on the right side of the floorboard behind the front <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>passenger seat where Copeland had been sitting. Lodge recovered the bag. Lodge testified that these events occurred in the parking lot of the Court Street Baptist Church and school where children from pre-kindergarten to the eighth grade were educated.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">The drugs taken from Copeland\u2019s pocket were introduced into evidence at trial, as were the drugs found on the floorboard of the rear passenger seat of the car, together with $75 in cash found on Copeland\u2019s person. The certificate of analysis showed that the total weight of the cocaine recovered was 6.47 grams (3.01 grams found on Copeland and 3.46 grams found in the car).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">Portsmouth Police Detective R.M. Holly testified as an expert in the issues of packaging and distributing of narcotics. He testified that possession of 6.47 grams was inconsistent with personal use because it represented \u201cdays and days worth\u201d of drugs. He also noted other factors that were inconsistent with personal use and consistent with an intent to distribute, such as the \u201csheer size\u201d of the cocaine, the fact that the cocaine was in \u201cblocks,\u201d the manner in which the blocks were wrapped in individual packages, and the absence of a smoking device.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">The trial court denied Copeland\u2019s motions to strike the evidence as to both charges and convicted him as charged. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-8\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b482-9\">A. Search of Copeland\u2019s Pocket Was Constitutionally Valid</p>\n<p id=\"b482-10\">Copeland contends on appeal that the police did not have probable cause to arrest him, that the search of his pocket was therefore unlawful, and that the drugs the search yielded were improperly admitted. We agree that the police did not have probable cause to arrest Copeland. We find, however, that the evidence recovered from Copeland\u2019s pocket was admissible pursuant to the inevitable discovery exception to an otherwise invalid warrantless search.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>1. The Evidence Fails to Establish Probable Cause</p>\n<p id=\"ADr\">The determination of whether police may make a warrantless search or seizure involves issues of both law and fact, which we review <em>de novo </em>on appeal. <em>Ornelas v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 690, 699, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 1663, 134 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996); <em>Whitfield v. Commonwealth, </em>265 Va. 358, 361, 576 S.E.2d 463, 464 (2003). We give deference, however, to the trial court\u2019s subsidiary determinations of fact, disturbing them only when they are clearly in error. <em>Ornelas, </em>517 U.S. at 699, 116 S.Ct. at 1663; <em>Harris v. Commonwealth, </em>266 Va. 28, 32, 581 S.E.2d 206, 209 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\">Generally, a warrantless search is presumptively invalid. <em>Minnesota v. Dickerson, </em>508 U.S. 366, 372, 113 S.Ct. 2130, 2135, 124 L.Ed.2d 334 (1993). A warrantless search and seizure may be upheld, however, if it is conducted incident to a lawful arrest. <em>Italiano v. Commonwealth, </em>214 Va. 334, 336, 200 S.E.2d 526, 528 (1973). \u201c[W]hen probable cause exists to arrest a person, a constitutionally permissible search of the person incident to arrest may be conducted by an officer either before or after the arrest if the search is contemporaneous with the arrest.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">Probable cause is established by facts and circumstances which would lead a prudent person to believe that the suspect had committed or was committing an offense. <em>Beck v. Ohio, </em>379 U.S. 89, 91, 85 S.Ct. 223, 225-26, 13 L.Ed.2d 142 (1964).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-6\">The legal standard of probable cause, as the term suggests, relates to probabilities that are based upon the factual and practical considerations in everyday life as perceived by reasonable and prudent persons. The presence or absence of probable cause is not to be examined from the perspective of a legal technician. Rather, probable cause exists when the facts and circumstances within the officer\u2019s knowledge, and of which he has reasonably trustworthy information, alone are sufficient to warrant a person of reasonable caution to believe than an offense has been or is being committed. <em>Draper v. United States, </em>358 U.S. 307, 313 [79 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>S.Ct. 329, 333, 3 L.Ed.2d 327] (1959); <em>Schaum v. Commonwealth, </em>215 Va. 498, 500, 211 S.E.2d 73, 75 (1975). In order to ascertain whether probable cause exists, courts will focus upon \u201cwhat the totality of the circumstances meant to police officers trained in analyzing the observed conduct for purposes of crime control.\u201d <em>Hollis v. Commonwealth, </em>216 Va. 874, 877, 223 S.E.2d 887, 889 (1976).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b484-5\"><em>Taylor v. Commonwealth, </em>222 Va. 816, 820-21, 284 S.E.2d 833, 836 (1981); <em>see also Maryland v. Pringle, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, \u2014, 124 S.Ct. 795, 800, 157 L.Ed.2d 769, \u2014 (2003) (\u201cThe probable-cause standard is incapable of precise definition or quantification into percentages because it deals with probabilities and depends on the totality of the circumstances.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-9\">Furtive gestures alone have been held insufficient to establish probable cause. <em>See People v. Superior Court, </em>3 Cal.3d 807, 91 Cal.Rptr. 729, 478 P.2d 449, 454-55 (1970) (explaining why mere furtive gestures, without more, do not establish probable cause). However, furtive gestures coupled with other indicia of criminal engagement may suffice to establish probable cause. <em>See Sibron v. New York, </em>392 U.S. 40, 66, 88 S.Ct. 1889, 1904, 20 L.Ed.2d 917 (1968) (noting that \u201cdeliberately furtive' actions ... at the approach of strangers or law officers are strong indicia of <em>mens rea, </em>and <em>when coupled unth </em>specific knowledge on the part of the officer relating the suspect to the evidence of crime, they are proper factors to be considered in a decision to make an arrest\u201d (emphasis added)); 2 Wayne R. LaFave, <em>Search and Seizure </em>\u00a7 3.6(d), at 319 (3d. ed.1996) (\u201cif police see a person in possession of a highly suspicious object or some object which is not identifiable but which because of other circumstances is reasonably suspected to be contraband, <em>and then </em>observe that person make an apparent attempt to conceal that object ..., probable cause is then present\u201d (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-10\">Here, Officer Lodge did not have probable cause to believe Copeland had committed, or was committing, an offense. Lodge followed the car in which Copeland was a passenger because it was being driven erratically. The car\u2019s erratic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>movements incriminated the driver of the vehicle. When Lodge confronted the driver in the parking lot, he smelled alcohol on his breath and arrested him for driving under the influence of alcohol and for reckless driving. Lodge had no reason to believe that Copeland, a passenger in the vehicle, was involved in criminal activity. While Lodge was securing the driver near the front of the car, however, he noticed Copeland making furtive gestures. Copeland continued the suspicious movements despite several commands from Lodge to show his hands and despite the fact that Lodge pointed his weapon at him. Notwithstanding Copeland\u2019s behavior, we cannot say that it established probable cause to arrest him. Lodge did not see Copeland with an object of any kind, incriminating or otherwise. He testified only that Copeland repeatedly moved his hands into and out of his pocket and near the side of his body.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">The Commonwealth\u2019s reliance on <em>Parker v. Commonwealth, 255 </em>Va. 96, 496 S.E.2d 47 (1998), and <em>Farmer v. Commonwealth, </em>21 Va.App. 111, 462 S.E.2d 564 (1995), to buttress its argument that the police had probable cause to arrest Copeland is misplaced. In each case, circumstances other than furtive gestures and a refusal to comply with a police officer\u2019s command were proved. In <em>Parker, </em>the Supreme Court of Virginia found probable cause was established when the defendant placed a small object inside the waistband of his shorts while associating in an open-air drug market. <em>Parker, 255 </em>Va. at 106, 496 S.E.2d at 53. The police officer could see that the object was a small pink baggie because the defendant\u2019s shorts were made from a partially transparent mesh material. <em>Id. </em>at 107, 496 S.E.2d at 53. The officer testified that he knew from experience that pink baggies are often used to store cocaine. <em>Id. </em>When the police asked the defendant if he had anything in his \u201ccrotch,\u201d the defendant tightened his shorts in an apparent attempt to keep the baggie from falling. <em>Id. </em>Here, Officer Lodge saw no suspicious object, nor did the suspicious behavior and arrest occur in an area known for its high crime rate. <em>Parker </em>therefore does not support the Commonwealth\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>In <em>Farmer, </em>the police began observing the defendant after receiving an anonymous citizen complaint that someone matching the defendant\u2019s description was selling drugs. <em>Farmer, </em>21 Va.App. at 113, 462 S.E.2d at 565. The police discovered defendant in a \u201cprime illicit drug distribution\u201d area engaging in activity consistent with selling drugs. <em>Id. </em>When approached by the police, the defendant fled. <em>Id. </em>During his flight, the defendant attempted to reach into his pockets and dispose of something. <em>Id. </em>The officers caught the defendant, conducted a search, and discovered illicit drugs. <em>Id. </em>at 114, 462 S.E.2d at 565. We found these facts established probable cause that the defendant was engaged in criminal activity. <em>Id. </em>at 115, 462 S.E.2d at 566. In the case before us, no such additional facts incriminate Copeland. Officer Lodge observed nothing more than furtive hand gestures. Contrary to the Commonwealth\u2019s position, <em>Farmer </em>does not support a finding of probable cause on the facts here.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">We conclude therefore that the police conducted a search pursuant to an unlawful arrest.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">2. The Challenged Evidence Was Admissible Because Its Discovery Was Inevitable</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">The Commonwealth argues in the alternative that the evidence obtained from Copeland\u2019s pocket was admissible because its discovery was inevitable. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-8\">The inevitable discovery rule provides an exception to the requirement that a search be supported by a warrant. <em>Nix v. Williams, </em>467 U.S. 431, 447, 104 S.Ct. 2501, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>2510-11, 81 L.Ed.2d 377 (1984). The rule derives from the principle that fruits of an unlawful search are inadmissible at trial, <em>Wong Sun v. United States, </em>371 U.S. 471, 487-88, 83 S.Ct. 407, 417-18, 9 L.Ed.2d 441 (1963), if the challenged evidence \u201chas been come at by exploitation of that illegality.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 488, 83 S.Ct. at 417. Conversely, if the evidence is obtained \u201cby means sufficiently distinguishable to be purged of the primary taint,\u201d excluding the evidence does not serve the deterrent purpose of the rule. <em>Id. </em>(internal quotations omitted). The inevitable discovery rule is \u201can off-shoot of the independent source doctrine.\u201d <em>Wilkins v. Commonwealth, </em>37 Va.App. 465, 475, 559 S.E.2d 395, 399 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">To come within the exception, the Commonwealth must show:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-6\">(1) a reasonable probability that the evidence in question would have been discovered by lawful means but for the police misconduct, (2) that the leads making the discovery inevitable were possessed by the police at the time of the misconduct, and (3) that the police also prior to the misconduct were actively pursuing the alternative line of investigation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-7\"><em>Walls v. Commonwealth, </em>2 Va.App. 639, 656, 347 S.E.2d 175, 185 (1986). Application of the doctrine cannot rest on conjecture alone, but must be grounded in historical facts. <em>See Nix, </em>467 U.S. at 444 n. 5, 104 S.Ct. at 2509 n. 5; <em>see also United States v. Allen, </em>159 F.3d 832, 839 (4th Cir.1998) (noting that although \u201ca finding of inevitable discovery necessarily rests on facts that did not oceur[,] ... by definition the occurrence of these facts must have been likely\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-8\">The issue involves a mixed question of fact and law. We defer to the trial court\u2019s factual findings unless plainly wrong or without evidence to support them, but review the ultimate question of law, the application of the inevitable discovery doctrine, <em>de novo. See Trent v. Commonwealth, </em>35 Va.App. 248, 250, 544 S.E.2d 379, 380 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-9\">First, it is reasonable to conclude that the evidence recovered from Copeland would have been discovered by lawful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>means. In the course of walking around the car after securing the driver and \u201cchecking the passenger compartment from the outside of the vehicle visually,\u201d Officer Lodge discovered the cocaine on the rear floorboard because it was in plain view. <em>Arizona v. Hicks, </em>480 U.S. 321, 323, 107 S.Ct. 1149, 1151-52, 94 L.Ed.2d 347 (1987). The presence of illegal drugs on the floorboard directly behind the seat where Copeland was sitting, together with the nature and persistence of Copeland\u2019s furtive movements, constitute \u201cfacts and circumstances within the officer\u2019s knowledge, ... sufficient to warrant a person of reasonable caution to believe that an offense has been or is being committed.\u201d <em>Taylor v. Commonwealth, </em>222 Va. 816, 820-21, 284 S.E.2d 833, 836 (1981). The confluence of these historical facts would thus have given the police probable cause to arrest Copeland on possession of the cocaine found in the car. <em>See Pringle, </em>\u2014 U.S. at \u2014 - \u2014, 124 S.Ct. at 800-01 (holding that probable cause existed to arrest a passenger seated in the front of a car on a charge of possession of cocaine where police discovered cocaine in the backseat). It follows that the police would have lawfully arrested Copeland and conducted a search of his person incident to his arrest. <em>Chimel v. California, </em>395 U.S. 752, 763, 89 S.Ct. 2034, 2040, 23 L.Ed.2d 685 (1969). That search would have yielded the cocaine in Copeland\u2019s pocket.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">Second, the leads making the discovery of the cocaine in Copeland\u2019s pocket inevitable were present before the unlawful search. The leads were comprised of 1) the erratic driving of the automobile and the arrest of the vehicle\u2019s intoxicated driver, which would have led to a lawful warrantless search of the car and the discovery of cocaine lying on the back floorboard, and 2) Copeland\u2019s furtive hand movements on the right side of his body, which would have led police to reasonably conclude that the cocaine in the automobile, a few inches from the right rear passenger wall of the vehicle, belonged to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">Third, the police were actively pursuing another, independent line of investigation before the unlawful search of Copeland\u2019s pocket was conducted. Lodge\u2019s investigation of the driver had been initiated when he observed Copeland make his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>suspicious hand movements, followed by repeated refusals to comply with the officer\u2019s commands. Lodge was, at that time, engaged in determining why the car was being driven so erratically and why the driver had continued to drive on a flat tire.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">In short, the investigation of the driver and his car was independent of and remained untainted by the subsequent unlawful search of Copeland. <em>See Wilkins, </em>37 Va.App. at 477, 559 S.E.2d at 401. Stated differently, the cocaine in the rear passenger compartment of the vehicle and in Copeland\u2019s pocket would have been discovered irrespective of the initial unlawful search of Copeland. The trial court did not err in admitting the evidence discovered in Copeland\u2019s pocket.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">B. Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">Copeland contends that the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence was insufficient in two respects. First, Copeland argues the evidence did not establish that he possessed the cocaine found in the backseat. Second, Copeland argues the evidence was insufficient to establish he had the intent to distribute the cocaine while on school property. We find that Copeland\u2019s first argument is without merit, and we find that Copeland\u2019s second argument is procedurally barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">1. Constructive Possession Was Established</p>\n<p id=\"b489-9\">When evaluating the sufficiency of the evidence on appeal, we view the evidence in a light most favorable to the Commonwealth, granting to it all reasonable inferences that can be deduced from that evidence. <em>Ragsdale v. Commonwealth, </em>38 Va.App. 421, 429, 565 S.E.2d 331, 335 (2002). Furthermore, we will not disturb the judgment of the trier of fact unless it was plainly wrong or without evidence to support it. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b489-10\">The cocaine in the backseat of the car was admittedly not in Copeland\u2019s physical possession at the time of his arrest. The Commonwealth contends, however, that Copeland constructively possessed the cocaine. To prove constructive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>possession, \u201cthe Commonwealth must show that the defendant was \u2018aware of both the presence and character of the substance and that it was subject to his dominion and control.\u2019 <em>Powers v. Commonwealth, </em>227 Va. 474, 476, 316 S.E.2d 739, 740 (1984). \u2018Mere proximity to a controlled drug is not sufficient to establish dominion and control.\u2019 <em>Drew v. Commonwealth, </em>230 Va. 471, 473, 338 S.E.2d 844, 845 (1986).\u201d <em>Blake v. Commonwealth, </em>15 Va.App. 706, 708, 427 S.E.2d 219, 220 (1993). Proximity is, however, a factor that can be considered \u201cwhen determining whether the accused constructively possessed drugs.\u201d <em>Brown v. Commonwealth, </em>5 Va.App. 489, 492, 364 S.E.2d 773, 774 (1988). Furthermore, the defendant may possess the drugs jointly with one or more other persons. <em>Blake, </em>15 Va.App. at 708, 427 S.E.2d at 220.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">Here, the cocaine was found directly behind the car seat that Copeland occupied. Although his proximity to the cocaine alone does not establish possession, it was one factor the trial court could consider in reaching its verdict. Moreover, the cocaine was in plain view. Finally, the location of the cocaine was consistent with Copeland\u2019s furtive hand movements to the right side of his body and explained Copeland\u2019s repeated failures to comply with police commands to keep his hands where the officer could see them. Copeland\u2019s actions indicated that he was aware that the drugs were in the car and support the reasonable inference that he exercised dominion and control over the substance. Considering all the foregoing evidence, we cannot say that the trial court\u2019s decision was plainly wrong or without evidence to support it. Accordingly, we find that Copeland constructively possessed the cocaine found in the back of the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">2. Challenge to Evidence of Intent to Distribute While on School Property is Procedurally Barred</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">Finally, Copeland contends the evidence was insufficient to establish that he traveled onto school property with the intent to distribute the cocaine while on the property. We find that this argument is procedurally barred by Rule 5A:18 because Copeland failed to raise it at trial where Copeland <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>argued only that \u201cno evidence [was] presented that this was within a thousand feet of a school zone.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">Rule 5A:18 promotes the correction of error at the trial level. <em>Lee v. Lee, </em>12 Va.App. 512, 514, 404 S.E.2d 736, 737 (1991). It requires that the grounds of any objection be presented to the trial court, affording the trial judge an opportunity to consider the issues intelligently and take corrective action. <em>Martin v. Commonwealth, </em>13 Va.App. 524, 530, 414 S.E.2d 401, 404 (1992). The rule also prevents unfairness to the opposing party \u201cwho may have been able to offer an alternative to the objectionable ruling, but did not do so, believing there was no problem.\u201d <em>Lee, </em>12 Va.App. at 514, 404 S.E.2d at 737; <em>see also Weidman v. Babcock, </em>241 Va. 40, 44, 400 S.E.2d 164, 167 (1991). Counsel may satisfy the mandates of Rule 5A:18 in several ways. <em>Lee, </em>12 Va.App. at 515, 404 S.E.2d at 738. Counsel may make the grounds for his objection clear in a motion to strike the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence, or he may state the grounds in closing argument. <em>Id. </em>Under appropriate circumstances, counsel may also make the grounds of the objection known within twenty-one days of the court\u2019s final order. <em>See Weidman, </em>241 Va. at 44, 400 S.E.2d at 167.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">Here, Copeland failed to argue that the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence was insufficient to prove that he had the intent to distribute the cocaine on the school property. Copeland only argued that there was no evidence \u201cthat this was within a thousand feet of a school zone.\u201d Copeland therefore deprived the trial court of an opportunity to consider the grounds of the objection he now presents to us. Rule 5A:18 mandates that we not consider his appeal on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">Copeland\u2019s contention that the trial court denied him the opportunity to make his argument is without merit. Although the trial judge interrupted defense counsel\u2019s attempt to raise and argue the point, asking counsel to proceed with his next motion, nothing in the record shows that alternative avenues for preserving the objection were unavailable. Finally, Copeland\u2019s reliance on this Court\u2019s decision in <em>White v. Common</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number><em>wealth, </em>21 Va.App. 710, 467 S.E.2d 297 (1996), is misplaced. In <em>White, </em>the trial court raised <em>ex mero motu </em>a motion challenging the sufficiency of the evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 720, 467 S.E.2d at 302. We held that the appellant was not barred from raising that issue on appeal because the trial court essentially raised the issue for the defense. <em>Id. </em>Here, the trial court did not raise its own motion. For these reasons, Rule 5A:18 bars our consideration of this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">We further find no basis upon which to apply the ends of justice exception to this case. The ends of justice exception to Rule 5A:18 is narrow and is to be used sparingly. <em>Michaels v. Commonwealth, </em>32 Va.App. 601, 608, 529 S.E.2d 822, 826 (2000). Application of the ends of justice exception requires proof of an error that was \u201cclear, substantial and material.\u201d <em>Brown v. Commonwealth, 8 </em>Va.App. 126, 132, 380 S.E.2d 8, 11 (1989). \u201cThe record \u2018must affirmatively show that a miscarriage of justice has occurred, not that a miscarriage might have occurred.\u2019 \u201d <em>Akers v. Commonwealth, </em>31 Va.App. 521, 528 n. 2, 525 S.E.2d 13, 16 n. 2 (2000) (quoting <em>Redman v. Commonwealth, </em>25 Va.App. 215, 221, 487 S.E.2d 269, 272 (1997)). When considering a sufficiency of the evidence question not properly preserved at trial, the appellant</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A9S\">must do more than show that the Commonwealth failed to prove an element or elements of the offense. Otherwise, we would be required under the ends of justice exception to address the merits of every case where a defendant has failed to move to strike the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence as being insufficient to prove an element of the offense. Such a rule would obviate the requirement for making an adequate motion to strike or a contemporaneous objection that the evidence was insufficient.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b492-6\"><em>Redman, </em>25 Va.App. at 221, 487 S.E.2d at 272. The exception therefore will not be invoked unless the evidence affirmatively shows \u201cthat an element of the offense did not occur.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 222, 487 S.E.2d at 273.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">Copeland argues that the record affirmatively shows that the police chased the automobile into the school parking lot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>and that the absence of his intent to distribute cocaine on school property follows from that evidence. <em>See generally Toliver v. Commonwealth, </em>38 Va.App. 27, 561 S.E.2d 743 (2002). We disagree. The inquiry this Court must make, as articulated in our decision in <em>Redman, </em>is whether the evidence affirmatively establishes that Copeland did not intend to distribute the drugs on school property. <em>Mounce v. Commonwealth, </em>4 Va.App. 433, 436, 357 S.E.2d 742, 744 (1987) (\u201cIf the record before us proved that, under no circumstances, could [the omitted element be established], there would be a reasonable basis for this court to consider the issue for the first time on appeal.\u201d). Here, no evidence <em>affirmatively </em>shows that the element of intent to distribute drugs on school property was not established. <em>See Redman, </em>25 Va.App. at 222, 487 S.E.2d at 273. We therefore decline to apply the ends of justice exception to Rule 5A:18 and consider the merits of his sufficiency claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b486-9\">. Although Copeland\u2019s actions are sufficient to establish reasonable, articulable suspicion, the lawfulness of the search is not established on that ground because the search was not properly limited. <em>See Sibron, </em>392 U.S. at 65, 88 S.Ct. at 1904; <em>see also Harris v. Commonwealth, </em>241 Va. 146, 151-52, 400 S.E.2d 191, 194 (1991); LaFave, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 9.5(b), at 272 (\"[i]f the officer suspects that there is a gun at a particular location, this is hardly an excuse for foregoing a pat-down; if anything, it makes it more apparent than ever that the pat-down will be effective in confirming or dissipating that suspicion\"). Here, the evidence establishes that Officer Gilmore did not perform a pat-down of Copeland. Instead, he reached directly into his pocket.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
