HUMPHREYS, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b201-8\">Jimmy D. Harrison, Sr. appeals from a decision of the circuit court terminating his residual parental rights to his minor child, L.H.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Harrison contends the circuit court erred in ordering the termination because \u201cundisputed evidence\u201d proved that terminating contact between Harrison and L.H. would be detrimental to L.H. and, therefore, not in her best interests. Harrison further argues that the court erred in ordering the termination because L.H. suffers from Down\u2019s Syndrome and \u201cis not considered competent to request that [Harrison\u2019s] rights not be terminated even if she could request the same, and through termination, she will have no means to contact her father to request that he assist her in her care that she may require as an adult.\u201d For the reasons that follow, we affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-9\">\n<em>I. Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b201-10\">On appeal of an action to terminate residual parental rights, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the party prevailing below and afford the evidence all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom. The trial court\u2019s judgment, \u201cwhen based on evidence heard <em>ore tenus, </em>\u25a0will not be disturbed on appeal unless plainly wrong or without evidence to support it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b202-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number><em>M.G. v. Albemarle County Dept. of Social Services, </em>41 Va.App. 170, 180-81, 583 S.E.2d 761, 766 (2003) (quoting <em>Peple v. Peple, </em>5 Va.App. 414, 422, 364 S.E.2d 232, 237 (1988)) (other citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">On March 28, 2002, the Tazewell County Department of Social Services (the Department) filed a petition requesting that Harrison\u2019s residual parental rights to his daughter, L.H., be terminated. The petition requested termination pursuant to Code \u00a7 16.1-283, referring to the foster care plan and petition (approved by the court on February 27, 2002) \u201cas document[ing] termination ... as being in the best interests of the child.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">After a hearing on June 26, 2002, the Tazewell Juvenile and Domestic Relations District Court terminated Harrison\u2019s residual parental rights. Harrison appealed that decision to the circuit court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">During the circuit court hearing, Harrison testified that he separated from L.H.\u2019s mother, Vicki Harrison Crabtree, in 1993, when L.H. was approximately three years old. At the time of their separation, Crabtree and Harrison agreed that Harrison would take primary custody of L.H. Harrison maintained primary custody until August of 1999. At that time, Harrison was convicted in federal court on a charge of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. While he was awaiting sentencing on the federal conviction, Harrison asked Crabtree to take custody of L.H.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">Before Harrison was sentenced on the federal conviction, he was arrested on additional charges of distribution of cocaine, carrying a concealed weapon, and possession of controlled substance paraphernalia. Harrison remained incarcerated in relation to those charges throughout his subsequent trial in the Tazewell Circuit Court. He was sentenced on those convictions to serve eleven years and twenty-four months in the Bland Correctional Center, with six years suspended upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>certain conditions. Harrison testified that his \u201cexpected\u201d release date on the Virginia sentence was May of 2004. However, he acknowledged that, during the Virginia proceedings, he had been sentenced by the federal court to serve three years in federal prison in relation to his federal conviction for possession of a firearm. Due to his incarceration on the Virginia convictions, Harrison had not yet served the federal sentence. Thus, Harrison agreed that his \u201cultimate release date\u201d \u201cwould probably be around 2007.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">Harrison testified that, after his conviction on the Virginia charges, the court ordered that a presentence report be prepared in relation to those convictions. The report reflected that when Harrison was arrested on those charges, juveniles were found in his home smoking marijuana. In addition, the report stated that Harrison sold crack cocaine and cocaine from his home, that he had had a pattern of drug use for several years, that he smoked a half-an-ounce of marijuana per week, that he used a half-an-ounce of cocaine daily, and that he began selling cocaine in 1983.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">Harrison conceded that he used cocaine and marijuana in his home while L.H. resided with him there. Harrison claimed that he only sold the drugs, however, when L.H. was at school.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">Harrison further testified that, for reasons unrelated to the matter at issue, the Department had offered L.H. various services while she was in his custody. Those services included infant stimulation services and speech therapy.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">Harrison stated that he maintained contact with L.H. while he was in prison, he wrote to her once or twice per week and sent pictures to her. He testified that he and L.H. had a \u201cvery loving bond.\u201d He stated that, in his opinion, severing that bond would \u201cbother [L.H.] a lot\u201d and would be \u201cdetrimental\u201d to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>Harrison claimed that he intended to care for L.H. when he ultimately got out of prison by making sure that she received the appropriate therapy and education. He further claimed that he had housing secured for them to live in and that he would be able to obtain his \u201cVA\u201d benefits, social security and his retirement from \u201cJewell Smokeless Coal, [sic] &amp; Coke.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">Crabtree testified that the Department removed L.H. from her custody on July 20, 2000. Crabtree acknowledged that shortly thereafter, she was also arrested on criminal charges relating to drug abuse, and ultimately convicted of four counts of \u201cgiving fraudulent prescriptions.\u201d She testified that the circuit court suspended her related prison sentence, and placed her on probation. During her probation, the Department entered several foster care plans pertaining to L.H. and offered services to both L.H. and Crabtree. Crabtree failed to comply with many of the conditions contained within the foster care plans and continued to abuse prescription pain medication. Accordingly, Crabtree did not regain custody of L.H.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">After Crabtree tested positive on a routine drug screen, the trial court revoked her probation and ordered her to serve her underlying prison sentence. Crabtree testified that she was not scheduled to be released from prison until November of 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">Edwina Crawford, a child protective services supervisor with the Department, testified that she was present when L.H. was removed from Crabtree\u2019s care in July of 2000. She stated that the Department had received a call about problems at Crabtree\u2019s home. When Department workers arrived at Crabtree\u2019s home, they found Crabtree \u201cunconscious on the couch.\u201d L.H. and two of Crabtree\u2019s other children were in a bedroom, alone.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Crawford observed that there were no linens on the beds in the home and that the mattresses smelled of urine. She stated there was trash \u201call over the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>kitchen floor and empty beer bottles sitting on the counter and in the floor.\u201d L.H. appeared unkempt as if she had not been bathed.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\">Crawford stated that it took two hours to revive Crabtree. Crabtree looked bruised and swollen and seemed to have difficulty breathing, but she refused to go to the hospital. Crabtree directed Crawford to a prescription bottle of Oxycontin. Crawford observed that the prescription for sixty tablets had been filled the day before, but only two tablets remained in the bottle.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">While speaking with Crabtree, Crawford observed L.H. playing with a lighter, biting the baby, spraying hairspray in the baby\u2019s mouth, grabbing the genitals and breasts of female Department workers, and trying to get pills out of their hands. Crawford then removed L.H. and the other children from Crabtree\u2019s home.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">Deborah Large, L.H.\u2019s foster mother, testified that she was a \u201cspecially trained therapeutic foster\u201d parent. She stated that L.H. had been in her home for approximately two and a half years by the time of the hearing. When L.H. first came to her home, L.H. did not know how to feed herself, or how to dress or bathe herself. She stated L.H. did not talk, but would pull on people and would pull on women\u2019s breasts. Large testified that she had also observed L.H. \u201ctie a doll down in bed,\u201d and had observed her masturbating \u201cin front of people.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">Large stated that she sought medical help for L.H. after she arrived in her home and that she made sure L.H. received appropriate medication. At the time of the hearing, Large stated that L.H. could dress herself, eat and drink properly, she could \u201cspell some things,\u201d she could \u201cread some,\u201d she could count, and she was well behaved.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-8\">Large also testified that Harrison wrote to L.H. once per week and that L.H. enjoyed receiving the letters. She stated that L.H. had visited with Harrison twice and that the visits had gone \u201cvery well.\u201d Large agreed that it \u201cwould bother\u201d L.H. if she were forced to sever her bond with her father.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>April Workman, L.H.\u2019s special education teacher, testified that L.H. \u201cdoes not deal with change very well.\u201d She stated that when L.H. began in her class, in August of 2002, she would bite and spit. However, L.H. was doing \u201cwonderful\u201d at the time of the hearing. She further stated that L.H. was \u201cvery happy and well taken care of in the home situation she [was] in at [that] time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">Other Department workers testified that, due to complaints about L.H.\u2019s care unrelated to the ultimate removal, the Department began working with Harrison and L.H. as early as 1998 \u2014 prior to Harrison\u2019s arrests and incarceration. At that time, the Department offered services to both Harrison and L.H., but Harrison refused to take advantage of many of the services offered. The Department continued working with L.H. while Harrison was incarcerated, offering services to Crabtree and L.H. However, the Department offered no services to Harrison during his incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">In closing argument, Harrison contended that his residual parental rights should not be terminated because L.H. is a Down\u2019s Syndrome child who \u201ccan\u2019t make her wishes known,\u201d because no services were provided to him while he was incarcerated, because he had maintained a relationship with L.H. and had a plan for her care upon his release, and because L.H. might not be able to seek him out if she wished to maintain a relationship with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">The trial court ultimately ordered termination of Harrison\u2019s residual parental rights, finding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-7\">Mr. Harrison, I believe that you love [L.H.], which I ... I can\u2019t understand why you continued to use drugs, sell drugs and abuse drugs. Apparently, you were convicted in 1982, we\u2019re twenty (20) years past that and here you \u00e1re still serving time for cocaine abuse. These children deserve better; [L.H.] deserves better than this. I can\u2019t help but wonder when you were offered in-home services, one of the reasons that you didn\u2019t accept them, sir, was because of what you were doing in your home; you didn\u2019t want people in there; that is what I suspect. But it\u2019s clear that you <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>can\u2019t provide for her in the foreseeable future, not one (1) year, two (2) year[s], three (3) year[s], four (4) year[s] down the road. You\u2019re probably looking at a release date based on a fed time of more like May of 2008 would be more likely and [L.H.\u2019s] going to be turning eighteen (18) soon, soon after that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-4\">It\u2019s clear, sir, under 16.1-283(c) that without good cause you\u2019ve been unable to provide for the child, to remedy the conditions that placed the child in foster care and you can\u2019t do that in the future because of the place that you find yourself. I hope that you can have a relationship with your child after she turns eighteen (18); she\u2019s going to need you, but she, also, is entitled to a better life; she\u2019s entitled to the hope of having an adoptive home that won\u2019t ... that won\u2019t include drugs and drug abuse and jail time and letters from prison. She\u2019s entitled to better than that, and I hope she will get it. The Court will authorize that she continue in the custody of [the Department] and authorize that she be placed for adoption, as well.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">The court memorialized its findings in a written order dated March 20, 2003. The court stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-6\">The court further finds that [Harrison], while he loves his daughter, [L.H.], continued to use and sell illegal drugs even after a conviction and incarceration in 1982, that these illegal activities resulting [sic] in his present incarceration in 1999, that he did not accept services, to include in home services, offered prior to his incarceration, that he is not able to provide for his daughter, [L.H.], for the foreseeable future due to his current incarceration, that he is unable in a reasonable period of time not to exceed twelve months from the date [L.H.] was placed in foster care to remedy substantially the conditions which lead to or required continuation of the child\u2019s foster care placement and that [L.H.] would benefit from permanency. It is accordingly determined by clear and convincing evidence that the residual parental rights of [Harrison] for his daughter, [L.H.], should be terminated pursuant to [Code] \u00a7 16.1-283(C). Said children <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>[sic] are not fourteen years of age or older nor are they otherwise of an age of discretion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">Harrison signed the court\u2019s order, by counsel, noting:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-6\">\u201cSeen and objected to\u201d on the grounds that the drug use was not stated correctly in that there was a long period of no drug use by [Harrison], and on the grounds that he chose not to accept services because he was unaware of the type of services offered.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">\n<em>II. Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b208-8\">On appeal to this Court, Harrison contends the trial court erred in terminating his residual parental rights for two reasons. First, because the record reflects \u201cundisputed evidence that terminating contact between [Harrison] and his special needs daughter would be detrimental to [L.H.].\u201d Second, because L.H. suffers from Down\u2019s Syndrome, she \u201cis not considered competent to request that [Harrison\u2019s] rights not be terminated even if she could request the same [sic], and t[h]rough termination, she will have no means to contact her father to request that he assist her in her care that she may require as an adult.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b208-9\">We begin our analysis by recognizing that although Harrison raises two separate issues on appeal, it is clear from his brief and oral argument that he truly raises only one issue. That issue is whether the trial court erred in determining that the Department presented sufficient evidence from which it could determine that termination of Harrison\u2019s parental rights was in L.H.\u2019s best interests. In support of his argument, Harrison contends that: 1) \u201cample\u201d evidence proved it would not be in L.H.\u2019s best interests to lose contact with Harrison; 2) due to L.H.\u2019s condition, she \u201cmay not have the capacity to know that she may have a relationship with her father [once] she reaches adulthood\u201d; and 3) the Department failed to provide him with services during his incarceration, and thus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>failed to demonstrate that the requirements for termination, pursuant to Code \u00a7 16.1-283(C)(2) were met.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">Before turning to the merits of Harrison\u2019s argument, we note that the record reflects that Harrison raised no objection to the sufficiency of the evidence on these specific bases. However, because Harrison raised these arguments in his closing remarks before the bench, we will presume he \u201cafforded \u2018the trial court an opportunity to rule intelligently on the issues presented\u2019 \u201d prior to entry of its judgment. <em>Lee v. Lee, </em>12 Va.App. 512, 515, 404 S.E.2d 736, 738 (1991) (noting that \u201c[c]ounsel may meet the mandates of Rule 5A:18 in many ways,\u201d including by a motion to strike the evidence or by closing argument); <em>see also Kaufman v. Kaufman, </em>12 Va.App. 1200, 1204, 409 S.E.2d 1, 3-4 (1991) (quoting <em>Weidman v. Babcock, </em>241 Va. 40, 44, 400 S.E.2d 164, 167 (1991)). Accordingly, we will assume, without deciding, that Harrison properly preserved the issue and his related arguments for purposes of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">Nevertheless, for the reasons that follow, we find the evidence presented below was sufficient to support the trial court\u2019s determination that termination, pursuant to Code \u00a7 16.1-283(C), was supported by clear and convincing evidence. Indeed,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-6\">[although \u201c \u2018the rights of parents may not be lightly severed,\u2019 \u201d <em>Ward v. Faw, </em>219 Va. 1120, 1124, 253 S.E.2d 658, 661 (1979) (quoting <em>Malpass v. Morgan, </em>213 Va. 393, 400, 192 S.E.2d 794, 799 (1972)), \u201ctrial courts are vested with broad discretion in making the decisions necessary to guard and to foster a child\u2019s best interests[.]\u201d <em>Farley v. Farley, </em>9 Va.App. 326, 328, 387 S.E.2d 794, 795 (1990).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b209-7\"><em>M.G., </em>41 Va.App. at 187, 583 S.E.2d at 769. While we are mindful of the principle that \u201c \u2018[t]he termination of [residual] parental rights is a grave, drastic and irreversible action,\u2019\u201d <em>Helen </em>W. <em>v. Fairfax County Dep\u2019t of Human Dev., </em>12 Va.App. 877, 883, 407 S.E.2d 25, 28-29 (1991) (quoting <em>Lowe v. Dep\u2019t of Public Welfare of the City of Richmond, </em>231 Va. 277, 280, 343 S.E.2d 70, 72 (1986)), we \u201c\u2018presume[] [the trial court has] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>thoroughly weighed all the evidence [and] considered the statutory requirements.\u2019 \u201d <em>Logan v. Fairfax County Dep\u2019t of Human Dev., </em>13 Va.App. 123, 128, 409 S.E.2d 460, 463 (1991) (quoting <em>Farley, </em>9 Va.App. at 329, 387 S.E.2d at 796).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">Code \u00a7 16.1-283 provides as follows, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-5\">C. The residual parental rights of a parent or parents of a child placed in foster care as a result of court commitment, an entrustment agreement entered into by the parent or parents or other voluntary relinquishment by the parent or parents may be terminated if the court finds, based upon clear and convincing evidence, that it is in the best interests of the child and that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-6\"><em>% </em>if? ij&lt; # if;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-7\">2. The parent or parents, without good cause, have been unwilling or unable within a reasonable period of time not to exceed twelve months from the date the child was placed in foster care to remedy substantially the conditions which led to or required continuation of the child\u2019s foster care placement, notwithstanding the reasonable and appropriate efforts of social, medical, mental health or other rehabilitative agencies to such end. Proof that the parent or parents, without good cause, have failed or been unable to make substantial progress towards elimination of the conditions which led to or required continuation of the child\u2019s foster care placement in accordance with their obligations under and within the time limits or goals set forth in a foster care plan filed with the court or any other plan jointly designed and agreed to by the parent or parents and a public or private social, medical, mental health or other rehabilitative agency shall constitute prima facie evidence of this condition. The court shall take into consideration the prior efforts of such agencies to rehabilitate the parent or parents prior to the placement of the child in foster care.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b211-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>Code \u00a7 16.1-283(C)(2).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\">Thus, to grant the Department\u2019s prayer for termination pursuant to Code \u00a7 16.1 \u2014 283(C)(2), the trial court was required to find by clear and convincing evidence (1) that termination was in the best interests of L.H.; (2) that the Department offered \u201creasonable and appropriate\u201d services to Harrison to help him substantially remedy the conditions which led to or required continuation -of L.H.\u2019s \u201cfoster care placement\u201d; and (3) that, despite those services, Harrison failed, \u201cwithout good cause,\u201d to remedy those conditions \u201cwithin a reasonable amount of time not to exceed twelve months from the date the child was placed in foster care.\u201d Code \u00a7 16.1-283(C)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">Although it is true that both Large and Harrison testified that L.H. would be upset if Harrison\u2019s parental rights were terminated, the evidence clearly supported the trial court\u2019s decision that termination was in L.H.\u2019s best interests.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AV\">In determining what is in the best interests of the child, a court must evaluate and consider many factors, including the age and physical and mental condition of the child or children; the age and physical and mental condition of the parents; the relationship existing between each parent and each child; the needs of the child or children; the role which each parent has played, and will play in the future, in the upbringing and care of the child or children; and such other factors as are necessary in determining the best interests of the child or children.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b211-6\"><em>Barkey v. Commonwealth, 2 </em>Va.App. 662, 668, 347 S.E.2d 188, 191 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">The evidence in this case demonstrated that L.H. had not been in Harrison\u2019s care since 1999. Although she apparently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>loved her father, no evidence proved that she possessed a bond with him such that it would jeopardize her emotional and/or physical well-being if broken. To the contrary, the evidence proved that since L.H. had been in foster care, she had received a level of medical care and other services, including a structured and stable therapeutic home environment, that had allowed her to improve her basic living skills, as well as to make great strides in her educational environment.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">In addition, we have long held that \u201c[i]t is clearly not in the best interests of a child to spend a lengthy period of time waiting to find out when, or even if, a parent will be capable of resuming his responsibilities.\u201d <em>Kaywood v. Halifax County Dep\u2019t of Social Servs., </em>10 Va.App. 535, 540, 394 S.E.2d 492, 495 (1990). Although Harrison claims to have a plan for taking care of L.H. when he is finally released from prison, the record reflects that his release will not take place for several years \u2014 most likely, just before L.H. turns eighteen. While we have held that \u201clong-term incarceration does not, <em>per se, </em>authorize termination of parental rights,\u201d we have recognized that \u201cit is a valid and proper circumstance which, when combined with other evidence concerning the parent/ehild relationship, can support a court\u2019s finding by clear and convincing evidence that the best interests of the child will be served by termination.\u201d <em>Ferguson v. Stafford DSS, </em>14 Va.App. 333, 340, 417 S.E.2d 1, 5 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">Moreover, we find no basis for requiring the trial court to place more credibility in Harrison\u2019s proposed plans for the future than was warranted by his past actions. Indeed, the evidence proved that Harrison had been arrested and imprisoned for drug offenses in the early 1980\u2019s. Nevertheless, Harrison began using drugs once again, on a consistent basis, sometime after he had served that sentence. The evidence proved that Harrison not only used drugs, but also sold drugs from his home and allowed minors to use drugs while in his home. Harrison engaged in these activities while L.H., a special needs child, was in his custody and care.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>We further decline Harrison\u2019s invitation to create a \u201cspecial exception\u201d to the best interests analysis for parents of special needs children. Indeed, we find no authority supporting such an exception, nor has counsel provided any such authority. Instead, it is clear that L.H.\u2019s condition was merely another factor for the court to consider when proceeding through the requisite statutory analysis and making its determination pertaining to L.H.\u2019s best interests. <em>See Barkey, </em>2 Va.App. at 668, 347 S.E.2d at 191. The fact that L.H. may or may not be able to maintain a relationship with her father after she turns eighteen was, thus, not determinative of the trial court\u2019s analysis. Otherwise the trial court would have been denied the opportunity to evaluate the overall best interests of L.H. <em>at the time of the hearing and for the foreseeable future of her minority </em>\u2014 an idea that is plainly not in keeping with the statutory mandate, nor the paramount consideration of the trial court in such matters. <em>See id.; see also Roanoke City Dept. of Soc. Servs. v. Heide, </em>35 Va.App. 328, 337, 544 S.E.2d 890, 894 (2001). Thus, we conclude that this record contains clear and convincing evidence supporting the trial court\u2019s decision to terminate Harrison\u2019s .parental rights under Code \u00a7 16.1-283(0(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">Finally, although Harrison correctly notes that Code \u00a7 16.1-283(0(2) does not negate the Department\u2019s responsibility to offer him \u201creasonable and appropriate\u201d services, we have recognized that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-6\">[w]e must interpret the statutory mandate in accordance with the language chosen by the legislature. \u201cReasonable and appropriate\u201d efforts can only be judged with reference to the circumstances of a particular case. Thus, a court must determine what constitutes reasonable and appropriate efforts given the facts before the court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b213-7\"><em>Ferguson, </em>14 Va.App. at 338-39, 417 S.E.2d at 4. Accordingly, we find no merit in Harrison\u2019s contention on appeal that Code \u00a7 16.1-283(C)(2) required the Department to offer him services during his incarceration. It would be patently unreasonable to require the Department, under such circumstances, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>continue to offer services. Indeed, as reflected by the facts of this case, when L.H. was removed from Crabtree\u2019s home and placed in foster care, Harrison was in the long-term custody of the Department of Corrections. Thus as long as he was incarcerated, the Department would have had no avenue available to offer Harrison services aimed at assisting him in regaining custody of the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">Notwithstanding this, the record reflects that the Department in fact offered Harrison services before he became incarcerated and before L.H. was placed in foster care. However, Harrison refused to take advantage of those services. Further, the Department continued to offer services to L.H., as well as to Crabtree, and to communicate with Harrison as to his daughter\u2019s placement situation. Considering these circumstances, we find no error in the trial court\u2019s determination that the Department \u201creasonably and appropriately\u201d carried out its charge as required by the statute. <em>See Harris v. Lynchburg Div. Soc. Serv., </em>223 Va. 235, 242, 288 S.E.2d 410, 414 (1982) (holding that a parent will not be allowed to use the circumstance of incarceration as reason to excuse prior neglectful treatment of children).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">For these reasons we affirm the final order terminating Harrison\u2019s parental rights pursuant to Code \u00a7 16.1-283.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b201-11\">. The record demonstrates that the termination proceeding at issue also concerned the termination of L.H.'s mother\u2019s residual parental rights. However, that portion of the proceeding is not before us on this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b202-8\">. The record reflects that L.H., who was twelve years old at the time of the circuit court proceedings, suffers from Down\u2019s Syndrome.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b203-9\">. Harrison testified that he was incarcerated on federal drug charges in \"[19]84 or [19]85\u201d and had already served his sentence related to those convictions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b204-8\">. Crabtree had two other children, ages ten and two. Harrison is not the father of those children.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b208-10\">. Harrison does not argue on appeal that the court should have deemed L.H. to be of \"an age of discretion\u201d pursuant to Code \u00a7 16.1-283(G).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b211-8\">. We note that the trial court ordered the termination pursuant to \"Code \u00a7 16.1-283(C),\u201d but did not further specify which subsection it relied upon. Observing that the content of the court\u2019s order parallels the requirements set forth in Code \u00a7 16.1-283(C)(2), we presume that the termination was ordered pursuant to Code \u00a7 16.1-283(C)(2). Neither party contends otherwise.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
