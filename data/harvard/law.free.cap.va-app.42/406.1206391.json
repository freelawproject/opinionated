He contends the trial court erred by: 1) allowing dog trailing evidence in the case; 2) allowing experts to testify that their trailing dogs can determine the age of the trail and the direction of travel of the subject being trailed; 3) allowing expert opinion testimony when the expert cannot explain the scientific basis for the opinion; and 4) ruling inadmissible on grounds of hearsay testimony regarding the victim\u2019s consensual sexual relations with the defendant and her fianc\u00e9. For the reasons that follow, we affirm his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-10\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b460-11\">On appeal, we review the evidence and all reasonable inferences that may be drawn in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth as the party prevailing below. <em>Commonwealth v. Grimstead, </em>12 Va.App. 1066, 1067, 407 S.E.2d 47, 48 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>(1991). So viewed, the record shows that Aimee Marie Meadows, a twenty-three-year-old woman residing in Louisa County with her parents, was raped and murdered on November 12, 2000. Russell Adam Pelletier was charged and convicted of rape in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-61; capital murder during the commission of, or subsequent to, rape in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-31; using a firearm during the commission of murder in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1; and possessing a firearm after having been convicted of a felony in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2. The jury fixed his sentence at life in prison for capital murder and rape, and 3 years for illegal use of a firearm. The trial court entered final judgment consistent with the jury\u2019s verdict on November 4, 2002, and also sentenced appellant to 2 years for illegal possession of a firearm. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">Pelletier and Meadows both resided in Blue Ridge Shores, a subdivision located in Louisa County. Meadows left the family home to walk the dog after supper on November 12, 2000. She did not return. Her father, increasingly concerned about his daughter\u2019s welfare, began calling for her and the dog about 8:00 p.m. The dog returned alone about two hours later. An extensive search of the area proved unsuccessful. At 11:24 p.m., Meadows\u2019s father notified the police that his daughter was missing.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">Officer MacKay had been notified at 8:05 p.m. of a \u201cdomestic situation\u201d at the Pelletier residence involving Pelletier and his mother. MacKay began looking for both Meadows and Pelletier, but found neither.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">Meadows\u2019s body was ultimately discovered around noon on November 13, 2000 by a Blue Ridge Shores resident. Her body was floating about twelve to fifteen feet from a point of land which extends into a lake. A wound to the back of her head, two inches behind the left ear and below the earlobe, was observed.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-8\">At trial, Penny Radecker testified that she heard a gunshot about a half-hour or hour after she started using her computer at 10:00 p.m. the night Meadows failed to return home. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>Radecker\u2019s house is a two-minute walk from the beach area where Meadows\u2019s body was found.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">Shawn Lamb, a friend of Pelletier, received a telephone call from Pelletier between 10:30 and 11:00 on the same night. Pelletier told Lamb he had shot and killed a girl and threw her body into the lake. Lamb did not know Meadows and initially gave little credence to Pelletier\u2019s account. When he heard media reports about the killing, he contacted police and agreed to cooperate with their investigation by wearing a \u201cwire\u201d when he visited Pelletier\u2019s home on November 16, 2000. Pelletier told him that he met a \u201cgirl\u201d walking and that he \u201cstarted slapping her around, took her by the woods, told her to take her clothes off and ... to shake that ass.\u201d He said that, after the rape, they \u201cwent down to this boat,\u201d which he rowed to the middle of the lake. He asked Meadows if she intended to tell her parents about the rape. He then told her to look at him, put a gun against her head, and shot her. He described the shot as \u201cclose\u201d to the victim, such that it \u201ckind of like splattered.\u201d Pelletier also told Lamb that \u201cit was too much to row back so he threw [the victim] over into the lake.\u201d When he got back to the \u201cbank or dock,\u201d Pelletier said he sank the boat.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">Andrew Lettner, another friend of Pelletier, was present when Pelletier talked to Lamb. He heard Pelletier state that, after he \u201chad sex\u201d with Meadows, \u201cthey went to the beach,\u201d got \u201cin a boat and the girl ended up dead.\u201d Lettner testified that Pelletier said that he had pulled the gun on her, told her to undress, made her bend over, and raped her. After telling \u201cthe girl\u201d to put her clothes back on, he forced her to walk to the beach and \u201cmade her get into the boat.\u201d After she stated her intention to tell her father about the rape, Pelletier \u201cgrabbed her by the back of the head and shot her once.\u201d Lettner also testified that Pelletier said he threw \u201cthe girl\u2019s\u201d body in the water, rowed back to the shore, wiped his fingerprints off, and walked home.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">While in jail, Pelletier wrote a letter to Lettner, which was introduced into evidence, asking Lettner to lie about what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>happened and explaining the approach he wanted Lettner to take:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-5\">We were chilling [at Pelletier\u2019s house] drinking. After a while we saw Amy [sic] walking her dog up the street. I called her over to us. The dog left. I asked her if I could fuck. She said OK. So I fucked it, while you keep drinking____Any side question they ask say I don\u2019t know I was drunk. When I finished fucking, Amy [sic] asked for some beer____She left about <em>7:30. </em>If they ask how we know, you had a watch on. We chilled and drank till 8:30. You made a phone call for a ride. About 9:00 you left and went home or wherever. I\u2019m fine after that. You got to memorize this shit. I need you bad on this.... I walk away from this two ways! A dead man or a rich man. I wanna be rich! When this is in your head till it hurts, <em>bum this letter!</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b463-9\">Dr. William Gormley, Assistant Chief Medical Examiner to the Chief Medical Examiner\u2019s Office in Richmond, Virginia, testified at trial and concluded that Meadows\u2019s death was caused by a gunshot wound with a bullet passing through the brain. Other studies were also conducted by Dr. Gormley, and blood and vaginal swabs were collected.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-10\">James Pickelman testified as an expert in firearms identification. He reported the results of his examination of the bullet taken from Meadows\u2019s body and its comparison with a bullet found in the ceiling of Pelletier\u2019s bedroom. Both bullets came from a .38 caliber weapon, which could include a .357 caliber weapon, and both had five lands and grooves which twisted to the right. Pickelman concluded that bullets were similar and the possibility that both had been fired from the same weapon could not be eliminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-11\">Lisa Shiermier, an expert in DNA analysis, testified that Pelletier\u2019s genetic material was present on vaginal swabs and on the wrist area of the left sleeve of a shirt recovered from the floor next to the foot of Pelletier\u2019s bed. The stain was a mixture of blood and another fluid. A hair found wrapped on the brace that held the fire extinguisher inside a boat found on the other side of the lake was determined to be consistent with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>Meadows\u2019s DNA profile. The owner testified that, to his knowledge, Meadows had never been in his boat.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">The Commonwealth also successfully admitted dog trailing evidence by calling two additional expert witnesses, Detective Stuart L. Gamer and Sgt. Patrick Sheridan. In this case, Garner used a dog named Ranger, and Sheridan used a dog named Annie. Before Gamer and Sheridan were allowed to testify, however, the trial court held a hearing to determine the admissibility of the dog trailing evidence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> That hearing established that Garner had been a bloodhound handler for eighteen years, during which time he had \u201cworked well over a thousand (1,000) actual cases.\u201d Gamer is a member of the \u201cNational Police Bloodhound Association, which is recognized as the foremost authority on bloodhounds within the United States\u201d and \u201cwas co-founder of the Virginia Bloodhounds Search and Rescue Association.\u201d He is an instructor in the ICAST Association, \u201ca group of handlers and instructors that travel to foreign countries to assist in the training of bloodhounds.\u201d Gamer attends at least two training seminars a year, and had been an instructor at four to six one-week seminars during each of the two years that preceded this case. He stated that he \u201cworked bloodhounds\u201d in over 50 Virginia jurisdictions and that his dogs have been \u201crecognized as credible witnesses within the court systems of Fluvanna County and Louisa County.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">Garner addressed the process underlying the dog\u2019s ability to follow a trail. He explained that bloodhounds are able to discriminate among the individual scents of different persons. He explained that humans cast off skin cells at the rate of 50,000 to 60,000 per minute. These skin cells are decomposed by naturally occurring bacteria, and the bacteria emit gaseous byproducts which can be detected by the hound. The scent produced by the decomposition of each person\u2019s skin cells is distinct to that individual because each person ingests differ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>ent kinds of food products and uses different kinds and amounts of soap and toiletries. The animal discriminates among all other scents present and has been trained to follow the scent of a particular individual once exposed to that person\u2019s scent. If the particular scent is not present at the scene, the dog has been trained to signify the absence of the scent by not \u201cworking\u201d or \u201ctrailing\u201d and by pulling on the harness and rope.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">Garner further testified that during his dog\u2019s training, Ranger would consistently follow a trail in the direction in which it was made. Despite efforts by Garner to force Ranger to trail in the wrong direction, Garner stated that Ranger always traveled in the same direction that the test subject had traveled. He expressed confidence in his dog\u2019s abilities, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-6\">[Tjhrough ... trial and error and setting up and composing trails and constantly challenging that dog\u2019s abilities, setting up different sequences, different trails, different links, different ages and also having as a young dog, being able to observe my runner walk from Point A to Point B, in my mind I already know which way the runner has gone. This is for training exercises and that dog consistently will go the correct direction____ [Tjhrough my records, I can show that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b465-9\">He also testified that Ranger would always track the most recent or \u201chottest\u201d scent.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-10\">Based on the foundation provided by Garner, the trial court found each expert to be qualified to give opinion evidence on matters involving dog handling, training, and the interpretation of the dog\u2019s behavior when trailing a particular scent.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-11\">Garner and his dog, Ranger, trailed Pelletier on November 15, 2000, beginning from the point on the beach where Meadows\u2019s body was recovered from the lake. The bloodhound was alerted to the scent by a towel collected from Pelletier\u2019s home. Gamer interpreted Ranger\u2019s body language as signifying the presence of Pelletier\u2019s scent at that location. The trail led from the beach, to the clubhouse, out to the main street, South <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>Lakeshore Drive, into a yard, and back to the roadway. Ranger followed the scent to the door of Pelletier\u2019s residence, where the dog indicated the trail ended.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">Garner and Ranger also trailed Meadows\u2019s scent, starting at the front door of her residence and proceeding to the beach, passing by the clubhouse, and then proceeding west past some boat docks and another large building. The trail led into a wooded area along a path to a bluff, then to flat ground and the water\u2019s edge. Garner described an area of \u201cpool scent\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> at this location and testified that the dog\u2019s body language indicated that \u201csomething had happened here.\u201d Ranger eventually left the \u201cpool scent\u201d area and trailed along the water\u2019s edge ending on the point of land nearest the place where Meadows\u2019s body was recovered. Garner opined that Meadows had either left the pool scent area and entered the water, or had actually been on the point of land. He conceded, however, that the scent Ranger detected on the point of land could have drifted there from a location on, or in, the water. Sheridan and his bloodhound, Annie, also trailed Meadows and Pelletier and obtained similar results.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">Garner also testified that the age of the trail his dog followed in this case ranged from sixty-one to sixty-four hours old. He explained that he relied on other evidence that indicated the age of the trail and then observed the dog\u2019s responses on the trail to determine if they corroborated the known data establishing the trail\u2019s age. Sheridan did not offer an opinion on the age of the trail or on the possible direction of travel.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">In the defense\u2019s ease-in-chief, Pelletier called Michael Taylor, a friend of Meadows. But for a sustained hearsay objection, Taylor would have testified that Meadows told him that she and Pelletier had been having consensual sexual relations for over two months. Taylor also would have testified that Meadows told him that she had been having sex with her fianc\u00e9, Steve Piatt, unbeknownst to her father, Darrell Mead<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>ows, who denied knowledge of any of Meadows\u2019s sexual encounters.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-4\">Pelletier also testified in his own defense. He claimed he had engaged in consensual sex with Meadows in the woods near his home. He said they were interrupted and that she left after he gave her some beer. He denied talking by telephone to Lamb on November 12, but admitted he told Lamb that he had raped and killed Meadows, explained he was \u201cjust messing with him.\u201d Pelletier also claimed Lamb brought a gun into his house and fired into the ceiling. Lamb denied doing so and denied owning a gun. Pelletier also admitted asking Lettner to he for him, but claimed he could not remember making most of the other statements Lettner attributed to him. He admitted he told Lettner that he ordered Meadows to \u201cshake ass and everything\u201d and that he had \u201cshot her in the head or something.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">Pelletier challenges his convictions, claiming that the trial court improperly allowed the dog trailing evidence as set forth above and improperly excluded exculpatory hearsay testimony. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">A. Admissibility of Expert Opinion Regarding Dog-Trailing Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">Pelletier contends that the Commonwealth failed to lay a proper foundation for the admission of Gamer\u2019s expert testimony. Specifically, he complains that the Commonwealth did not establish the reliability of dog-trailing methods because Garner could not scientifically explain the dog\u2019s ability to discern the age of the trail and the direction in which the suspect traveled. Pelletier also argues that evidence of the route the dogs followed should not have been allowed because the dogs did not begin trailing at a place where other evidence proved Pelletier had been, as required by <em>Epperly v. Commonwealth, </em>224 Va. 214, 294 S.E.2d 882 (1982). We find that Pelletier\u2019s contentions are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>\u201cIt is well settled in Virginia that the opinion of an expert witness is admissible \u2018where the jury ... is confronted with issues\u2019 that \u2018cannot be determined intelligently merely from the deductions made and inferences drawn on the basis of ordinary knowledge, common sense, and practical experience.\u2019 \u201d <em>Schooler v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 418, 420, 417 S.E.2d 110, 111 (1992) (quoting <em>Compton v. Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 716, 726, 250 S.E.2d 749, 755-56 (1979)). An \u201c \u2018expert\u2019s testimony is admissible not only when scientific knowledge is required, but when experience and observation in a special calling give the expert knowledge of a subject beyond ... common intelligence and ordinary experience.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hetmeyer v. Commonwealth, </em>19 Va.App. 103, 108, 448 S.E.2d 894, 898 (1994) (quoting <em>Hubbard v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 250, 254, 403 S.E.2d 708, 710 (1991), <em>aff'd, </em>243 Va. 1, 413 S.E.2d 875 (1992)).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">It is equally \u201cwell established that the admissibility of expert testimony is within the sound discretion of the trial court, and that court\u2019s decision will not be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Patterson v. Commonwealth, </em>3 Va.App. 1, 11, 348 S.E.2d 285, 291 (1986); <em>see also Toro v. City of Norfolk, </em>14 Va.App. 244, 252, 416 S.E.2d 29, 33 (1992). A challenge to an \u201cexpert\u2019s ... methods and determinations ..., even by other experts, does not render inadmissible expert opinion based on those ... methods and computations\u201d but goes to the \u201cweight of the evidence,\u201d raising \u201cfactual questions to be determined by the jury.\u201d <em>Hubbard, </em>12 Va.App. at 255, 403 S.E.2d at 710.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">The Virginia Supreme Court has permitted expert testimony regarding dog tracking evidence when a proper foundation has been laid.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-7\">We hold that dog-tracking evidence is admissible in a criminal case after a proper foundation has been laid to show that the handler was qualified to work with the dog and to interpret its responses, that the dog was sufficiently trained and proven tracker of human scent, that the dog was placed on the trail where circumstances indicated that the guilty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>party had been, and that the trail had not become so stale or contaminated as to be beyond the dog\u2019s tracking capabilities.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b469-5\"><em>Epperly, </em>224 Va. at 233, 294 S.E.2d at 893.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\"><em>Epperly </em>does not hold that dog tracking evidence must be explained scientifically before it can be admitted. Nevertheless, Pelletier contends that all expert testimony, whether it involves a scientific field, such as DNA analysis, or a highly specialized one, such as dog trailing or tracking, must be preceded by adequate scientific explanation that establishes its reliability. The courts of the Commonwealth, however, routinely allow expert testimony without a scientific foundation where \u201c \u2018the jury ... is confronted with issues\u2019 that \u2018cannot be determined intelligently merely from the deductions made and inferences drawn on the basis of ordinary knowledge, common sense, and practical experience.\u2019 \u201d <em>Schooler, </em>14 Va.App. at 420, 417 S.E.2d at 111 (quoting <em>Compton, </em>219 Va. at 726, 250 S.E.2d at 755-56.). An \u201c \u2018expert\u2019s testimony is admissible <em>not only when </em>scientific knowledge is required, but when <em>experience and observation </em>in a special calling give the expert knowledge of a subject beyond ... common intelligence and ordinary experience.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hubbard, </em>12 Va.App. at 254, 403 S.E.2d at 710 (quoting <em>Neblett, Adm\u2019r v. Hunter, </em>207 Va. 335, 339-40, 150 S.E.2d 115, 118 (1966)) (emphasis added). For example, in criminal prosecutions for possession of drugs with the intent to distribute, the element of \u201cintent to distribute\u201d must often be proved by expert testimony regarding the quantity of drugs discovered. \u201c \u2018Expert testimony, usually that of a police officer familiar with narcotics, is routinely offered to prove the significance of the weight and packaging of drugs regarding whether it is for personal use.\u2019 \u201d <em>Askew v. Commonwealth, </em>40 Va.App. 104, 109, 578 S.E.2d 58, 61 (2003) (quoting <em>Shackleford v. Commonwealth, </em>32 Va.App. 307, 327, 528 S.E.2d 123, 133 (2000)). The typical police officer qualifies as an expert based on his experience with narcotics, not on his ability to explain the scientific theory behind his opinion. An opinion regarding whether a certain quantity of drugs is inconsistent with personal use is not, in fact, susceptible of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>\u201cscientific\u201d explanation as we traditionally understand the term. It is an opinion derived wholly from experience. Likewise, a clear majority of states allows dog tracking evidence despite the fact that the dog\u2019s ability cannot be scientifically explained.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-5\">Many courts have ruled that ... evidence of tracking a defendant is admissible, subject to establishment of a proper foundation. Even though the precise scientific basis for dog tracking remains uncertain, it is clear that such dogs can be trained to almost unerringly follow a trail left by particular persons even after some time has passed, and even though the trail has crossed the scent left by other persons.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">Jay M. Zitter, Annotation, <em>Evidence of Trailing by Dogs in Criminal Cases, </em>81 A.L.R.5th 563 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\"><em>Epperly </em>does not require that a scientific foundation be laid for the admission of dog trailing evidence. Rather, it holds that dog trailing evidence must be empirically shown to be reliable from experience. The showing of reliability is met by testimony from the handler establishing that he \u201cwas qualified to work with the dog and to interpret its responses\u201d and that \u201cthe dog was a sufficiently trained and proven tracker of human scent.\u201d <em>Epperly, </em>224 Va. at 233, 294 S.E.2d at 893. Pelletier, in fact, concedes in his opening brief that dog trailing evidence can be admitted \u201cif it can be shown that, even though we don\u2019t know how or why, there is overwhelming empirical evidence that the dog has the ability to do what is claimed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">Here, the Commonwealth met the foundational requirements for dog trailing evidence established in <em>Epperly, </em>and Garner\u2019s opinion on the direction of travel and the age of the trail was properly allowed. Garner testified that he had tested Ranger\u2019s ability to discern the direction of travel. In training Ranger, Garner used a runner to go from point A to point B. After alerting Ranger to the runner\u2019s scent, Garner took the dog to a point along the trail. Garner tried to force Ranger to go in a direction opposite to the direction the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>runner had taken, but \u201c[ijnvariably ... he would turn and seek the freshest, hottest scent, thus going [along the path of the runner] from A to B.\u201d Garner could not explain the scientific principles underlying Ranger\u2019s ability, opining only that it must be \u201cGod-given instinct.\u201d Garner, however, was not required to establish the scientific basis of a trailing dog\u2019s ability to follow scent in order for his opinion to be admitted. His testimony proved that Ranger was \u201csufficiently trained,\u201d that Garner \u201cwas qualified to work with the dog and to interpret its responses,\u201d and that the responses had proved rehable in numerous other cases. This empirical evidence was sufficient to establish the reliability and, therefore, the admissibility of Garner\u2019s opinion. <em>See Hetmeyer, </em>19 Va.App. at 110, 448 S.E.2d at 898 (holding that \u201c[ejvidence regarding the trailing dog\u2019s certification, recertification, training regime, and near-perfect past performance was clearly sufficient to demonstrate the dog\u2019s high degree of reliability\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">Pelletier also challenges Garner\u2019s opinion regarding the age of the trail, contending it was nothing more than \u201cpost-hoc rationalization.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Pelletier misapprehends the nature and scope of Garner\u2019s testimony. Garner frankly explained that his opinion regarding the age of the trail did not rest solely on his dog\u2019s trailing efforts. Instead, he relied on other evidence signifying the age of the trail and then observed the dog\u2019s responses on the trail to determine if they corroborated the known data on trail age. Garner, furthermore, explained that his opinion was based on the experience he gathered by investigating thousands of trails of various ages and comparing the known age of the trails with several empirical factors, such as the speed the dog traveled on the trail and the tension on his lead. As noted above, the admissibility of expert opinion may be established by empirically-derived knowledge. <em>See Epperly, </em>224 Va. at 233, 294 S.E.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>at 893; <em>Hetmeyer, </em>19 Va.App. at 110, 448 S.E.2d at 898. Consistent with the methodology he outlined, Garner acknowledged he was aware of other evidence establishing the trail\u2019s age and that his opinion was based both on that evidence and the reactions of the dog that corroborated it. He never testified that his opinion regarding the trail\u2019s age was based solely on the reactions of the trailing dog as explained by his interpretations of those reactions. We find that the requisite foundation admitting evidence of trail age was laid and that Pelletier\u2019s objection to Garner\u2019s opinion on the age of the trail goes only to the weight of his testimony, not to its admissibility. <em>Tarmac Mid-Atlantic v. Smiley Block Co., </em>250 Va. 161, 167, 458 S.E.2d 462, 466 (1995); <em>see also Epperly, </em>224 Va. at 233, 294 S.E.2d at 893. We do not evaluate the weight of evidence on appeal; that function resides with the trier of fact. <em>See Tarmac, </em>250 Va. at 167, 458 S.E.2d at 466.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">Finally, Pelletier contends that the Commonwealth failed to prove the <em>Epperly </em>requirement that the dog was placed on the trail where other evidence establishes the defendant had been. <em>See Epperly, </em>224 Va. at 233, 294 S.E.2d at 893. To be sure, Garner and his dog began trailing Pelletier on the beach, and Garner conceded he could not be certain that Pelletier had been there. He opined that the scent that Ranger picked up may have drifted from the water onto the pier rather than originating there. However, <em>Epperly </em>does not require definitive proof of the defendant\u2019s presence at a particular place on the trail. Where the evidence establishes a nexus with the defendant\u2019s location and the commission of the crime under investigation, the mandate of <em>Epperly </em>has been met. Here, evidence, both direct and circumstantial, establishes that Pelletier admitted that he raped and killed the victim and then returned to the beach or the dock and that the victim\u2019s body was located in proximity to the point of land where the trailing began. Furthermore, Lettner testified that Pelletier said he \u201cwent to the beach\u201d after the rape, and Lamb testified that Pelletier disposed of Meadows\u2019s body in the lake. We find the evidence connecting Pelletier with the trail that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>Garner and his dog followed was sufficient to meet the <em>Epperly </em>requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\">B. Admissibility of Hearsay Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">Pelletier also contends that the Court erred in prohibiting Taylor\u2019s testimony regarding the victim\u2019s statements of her sexual relationship with Pelletier and Piatt. Pelletier contends Taylor would have testified that, two days before her death, Aimee Meadows told him that she and Pelletier were having consensual sexual relations. Pelletier also asserts Taylor would have testified that she told him that \u201cshe would sneak downstairs to have sex with ... Piatt when Mr. Piatt spent the weekend at the Meadows\u2019s residence.\u201d Taylor\u2019s testimony was prohibited because it constituted hearsay and did not fall within any recognized exception. Pelletier argues that the testimony should have been allowed under the \u201cstatement against penal interest\u201d exception to the rule prohibiting hearsay because the victim admitted to fornication, a crime in Virginia.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We find that Pelletier\u2019s claims are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">As the party \u201cseeking to rely upon an exception to the hearsay rule,\u201d Pelletier has the burden of establishing the admissibility of Taylor\u2019s testimony. <em>Neal v. Commonwealth, </em>15 Va.App. 416, 421, 425 S.E.2d 521, 524 (1992). To come within the declaration against penal interest exception, the proponent must establish that: \u201c(1) the declarant [was] unavailable to testify at trial; (2) the statement [was] against the declarant\u2019s interest at the time it was made; and (3) the declarant [was] aware at the time the statement [was] made that it [was] against his or her interest to make it.\u201d <em>Randolph </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number><em>v. Commonwealth, </em>24 Va.App. 345, 355, 482 S.E.2d 101, 105-06 (1997) (quotations and citations omitted). Whether the declarant was aware that the statement was against her penal interest is based upon her subjective belief that she could face criminal charges. <em>See Chandler v. Commonwealth, </em>249 Va. 270, 279, 455 S.E.2d 219, 224 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">Pelletier, as the proponent of the exception, fails to meet his burden on the third requirement. No evidence exists that would indicate the victim subjectively believed she was making a statement against her penal interest when she admitted to sexual relationships outside of marriage. We find the trial court did not err in excluding the proffered testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">We conclude that the trial court properly allowed the dog trailing evidence and properly excluded Taylor\u2019s testimony. Accordingly, we affirm Pelletier\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b464-7\">. The Commonwealth and Pelletier agreed that Garner would provide testimony regarding the overall theory of dog trailing, but that Gamer and Sheridan would testify separately as to what each dog discovered.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b466-8\">. Garner described \u201cpool scent\u201d as a large amount of scent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b471-6\">. Pelletier further argues that <em>all </em>of the dog trailing evidence should have been excluded because it constituted nothing more than \"post-hoc rationalization.\" However, Pelletier cites no authority in support of this argument. Accordingly, we decline to address it. <em>Buchanan v. Buchanan, </em>14 Va.App. 53, 56, 415 S.E.2d 237, 239 (1992).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b473-7\">. Pelletier also argues that the refusal to allow Taylor\u2019s testimony violates his Sixth Amendment right to confrontation. This argument is procedurally barred by Rule 5A:18. Pelletier did not make the argument known to the trial court until three months after trial in his motion to set aside the verdict. \"Thus, the objection came too late for any error to be corrected by the trial court, and for the error, if any, to constitute reversible error.\u201d <em>Ryan v. Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 439, 447, 247 S.E.2d 698, 704 (1978); <em>see also Carter v. Nelms, </em>204 Va. 338, 343, 131 S.E.2d 401, 404 (1963).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
