For the reasons that follow, we affirm Spencer\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">Cornelius Lorenzo Spencer was tried and convicted on charges of grand larceny in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-95 and carjacking in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-58.1. The trial court sentenced him to five years imprisonment, with four years suspended, on the grand larceny charge, and ten years imprisonment, with nine years suspended, for the carjacking offense. He contends the evidence was insufficient to establish the carjacking conviction; the grand larceny conviction was not challenged.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">We review the evidence on appeal, together with the reasonable inferences that may be drawn, in the light most favorable to the party who prevailed below. <em>Commonwealth v. Grimstead, </em>12 Va.App. 1066, 1067, 407 S.E.2d 47, 48 (1991). So viewed, the record shows that on February 6, 2002, Teal Smith drove her car, a 1994 Toyota Camry, to the rental office of the Hilliard Apartments in Henrico County where she intended to drop off her rent cheek. When she arrived at approximately 12:45 a.m., Smith \u201cpulled ... up to the curb[,] ... left the car running with the headlights on[,] walked over\u201d to the rental office, and \u201cdropped [her rental check] through the slot.\u201d She was ten feet from her ear. As she returned to her vehicle, Smith \u201cheard somebody running across the street.\u201d She turned and saw Spencer open her car door and jump into the car. He did not immediately drive away, however. Thinking that someone was \u201cplaying a joke,\u201d Smith walked up to the car and stood in front of it, touching the car for a minute or two and staring at Spencer through the windshield.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">As she stood there, Spencer put the ear in gear and bumped her legs with the car, causing bruising. Smith nevertheless stood her ground, recalling that she \u201cwasn\u2019t really nervous,\u201d because she \u201cwas so in shock.\u201d However, when the car started rolling toward her again, Smith moved away, knowing that \u201cif [she] didn\u2019t ... she might get run over.\u201d Spencer drove away in Smith\u2019s car.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>Officer Stephen Canada of the Henrico County Police Department received the report of Smith\u2019s stolen vehicle at approximately 1:13 a.m. At about 2:39 a.m., he saw a car that matched the description of Smith\u2019s car. Once he verified that the car he saw belonged to Smith, Officer Canada stopped the vehicle and arrested Spencer.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">Smith identified Spencer at trial as the person who stole her car. Spencer testified and denied that he stole Smith\u2019s car, although he conceded he was driving the vehicle when Officer Canada stopped it; The trial court convicted Spencer of the offense, finding that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-6\">the facts of the case are sufficient to support the crime that\u2019s charged, because there\u2019s testimony that\u2019s basically uncontradicted that there was a seizure of the car during the time that Ms. Smith was still in possession of the car and that the person who committed that seizure intended to deprive Ms. Smith of her possession of the car, and the way that he intended to do that was by means of forcing her away with the threatening conduct of driving towards her.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AMk\">Spencer was sentenced to ten years imprisonment, nine years suspended, for the carjacking offense. This appeal ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"ALX\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b497-8\">When considering sufficiency claims on appeal, this Court \u201creview[s] the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, granting to it all reasonable inferences deducible therefrom.\u201d <em>Martin v. Commonwealth, </em>4 Va.App. 438, 443, 358 S.E.2d 415, 418 (1987). Applying this standard of review, the Court looks \u201cto that evidence which tends to support the verdict and to permit the verdict to stand unless plainly wrong.\u201d <em>Snyder v. Commonwealth, </em>202 Va. 1009, 1016, 121 S.E.2d 452, 457 (1961). \u201cThe judgment of a trial court sitting without a jury is entitled to the same weight as a jury verdict and will not be set aside unless it appears from the evidence that the judgment is plainly wrong or without evidence to support it.\u201d <em>Martin, </em>4 Va.App. at 443, 358 S.E.2d at 418. Moreover, \u201c[t]he credibility of the witnesses and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>weight accorded the evidence are matters solely for the fact finder who has the opportunity to see and hear that evidence as it is presented.\u201d <em>Sandoval v. Commonwealth, </em>20 Va.App. 133, 138, 455 S.E.2d 730, 732 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">B. Smith Still Had Possession of Her Car when Spencer Resorted to Violence</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">Code \u00a7 18.2-58.1 defines the elements of the instant offense as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-7\">\u201c[C]arjaeking\u201d means the intentional seizure or seizure of control of a motor vehicle of another with intent to permanently or temporarily deprive another in possession or control of the vehicle of that possession or control by means of partial strangulation, or suffocation, or by striking or beating, or by other violence to the person, or by assault or otherwise putting a person in fear of serious bodily harm, or by the threat or presenting of firearms, or other deadly weapon or instrumentality whatsoever.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b498-8\">\u201c[C]arjacking is a species of robbery.\u201d <em>Sanchez v. Commonwealth, </em>32 Va.App. 238, 241, 527 S.E.2d 461, 463 (2000). Therefore, \u201cthe requisite violence or intimidation must precede or be concomitant with the taking.\u201d <em>Bell v. Commonwealth, </em>21 Va.App. 693, 701, 467 S.E.2d 289, 293 (1996). \u201cRobbery, a common law offense in Virginia, is defined as the \u2018taking, with intent to steal, of the personal property of another, from his person or in his presence, against his will, <em>by violence or intimidation\u2019 \u201d Jones v. Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 736, 738, 496 S.E.2d 668, 669 (1998) (quoting <em>Harris v. Commonwealth, </em>3 Va.App. 519, 521, 351 S.E.2d 356, 357 (1986)); <em>see Mason v. Commonwealth, </em>200 Va. 253, 254, 105 S.E.2d 149, 150 (1958); <em>Graves v. Commonwealth, </em>21 Va.App. 161, 164, 462 S.E.2d 902, 903 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-9\">\u201cThe essential elements of common law robbery are (1) a felonious taking, (2) accompanied by an asportation of (3) personal property of value (4) from the person of another or in his presence, (5) against his will, (6) by violence or by putting him in fear, (7) <em>animo furandi </em>(with the intent to steal).\u201d <em>Chappelle v. Commonwealth, </em>28 Va.App. 272, 274-75, 504 S.E.2d 378, 379 (1998).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>\u201cThe actual taking and asportation of some of the victim\u2019s personal property is an essential element of robbery. In other words, there must first be a larceny \u2014 felonious taking. Supplementing the taking, as in larceny, there must be an asportation or carrying away of the goods. Severance of the goods from the owner and absolute control of the property by the taker, even for an instant, constitutes an asportation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b499-5\"><em>Mason, </em>200 Va. at 256, 105 S.E.2d at 151 (quoting 46 Am. Jur. <em>Robbery </em>\u00a7 6).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">\u201cViolence or force requires a physical touching or violation of the victim\u2019s person. The touching or violation necessary to prove the offense may be indirect, but cannot result merely from the force associated with the taking.\u201d <em>Bivens v. Commonwealth, </em>19 Va.App. 750, 752, 454 S.E.2d 741, 748 (1995). The force or intimidation that must be proved to sustain a conviction for robbery must be directed at the person of the victim. <em>Winn v. Commonwealth, </em>21 Va.App. 179, 182, 462 S.E.2d 911, 912 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">Relying on <em>Bell, </em>Spencer reasons that his larceny of Smith\u2019s car was complete when he \u201centered the vehicle, closed the door and sat in the driver\u2019s seat\u201d because he had \u201cgained possession and complete control of the vehicle.\u201d We find that his contention is without merit and that his reliance on <em>Bell </em>is misplaced. The issue before the Court in <em>Bell </em>was whether the evidence was sufficient to sustain a charge of carjacking where the defendant took the keys to the victim\u2019s car but the car was not in the victim\u2019s presence. <em>Bell, </em>21 Va.App. at 698, 467 S.E.2d at 291. In <em>Bell, </em>the victim parked her car and walked around the corner to her home. <em>Id. </em>at 696, 467 S.E.2d at 291. Bell followed the victim to her doorstep, demanded her car keys, took the keys, and ran to her car. <em>Id. </em>at 696-97, 467 S.E.2d at 291. This Court held that, when he took the victim\u2019s keys, Bell deprived her of possession of the car because she no longer had the means to exercise control of it. <em>Id. </em>at 699, 467 S.E.2d at 292. We, therefore, upheld Bell\u2019s conviction for carjacking. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>Analogizing to <em>Bell </em>and the import of the holding that the victim was found to have dominion and control over her vehicle at the time Bell took possession of the car keys, Spencer argues that, once he was inside Smith\u2019s car and had her vehicle\u2019s keys, which she had left in the ignition, he had possession of Smith\u2019s car. At that point, Spencer argues, the larceny was completed before any violence was exerted. Spencer misapprehends the distinguishing features of <em>Bell. </em>In <em>Bell, </em>the victim made no attempt to exercise dominion and control over the keys or the car which they controlled once the defendant obtained possession of them; rather, she was forced to relinquish her possessory interest in the keys and, by extension the car, by violence and intimidation. <em>Id. </em>Under those facts, we affirmed Bell\u2019s conviction of carjacking because the taking and asportation of the keys as a result of the defendant\u2019s intimidation, in effect, gave the defendant absolute control over the vehicle. <em>Bell </em>does not support the proposition, however, that possession of the car keys is alone determinative of the issue. <em>See, e.g., Brown v. Commonwealth, </em>37 Va.App. 507, 521, 559 S.E.2d 415, 422 (2002) (noting that determining \u201cpossession and control [of a vehicle] ... solely by the physical possession of the car keys\u201d has \u201cno support in the statute or case law\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">In the instant case, Smith did not relinquish her car to Spencer by leaving her keys in the vehicle. Nor did she relinquish her keys to him upon a showing of force, as did the victim in <em>Bell. </em>When she left her keys in the ignition, she remained in constructive possession and control of the vehicle, and she exercised that superior claim, challenging Spencer\u2019s attempt to divest her of it. She did so by standing in front of her car, blocking its passage, until Spencer bumped her with the car and forced her out of his path. <em>See Commonwealth v. Jones, </em>267 Va. 284, 289, 591 S.E.2d 68, 71, 2004 Va. Lexis 25, *8 (Jan. 16, 2004) (upholding robbery conviction where defendant \u201coriginally intended to commit larceny\u201d in stealing boots from a store but committed robbery when, in the store parking lot, he \u201cproduced [a] firearm to overcome the manager\u2019s opposition to the taking\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>\u201c \u2018In a robbery prosecution, where the violence against the victim and the trespass to his property combine in a continuing, unbroken sequence of events, the robbery itself continues as well for the same period of time.\u2019 \u201d <em>Quesinberry v. Commonwealth, </em>241 Va. 364, 373, 402 S.E.2d 218, 224 (1991) (quoting <em>Briley v. Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 532, 543, 273 S.E.2d 48, 55 (1980)).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">Applying these principles, we find that Smith retained possession of the vehicle when Spencer entered it in her presence and that, in an \u201cunbroken sequence of events,\u201d she was forced by Spencer, through violence and intimidation, to relinquish possession of the property. The taking and asportation of Smith\u2019s vehicle was accomplished only when Spencer intimidated and forced her to move from the path of the vehicle as he attempted to take the car. At that juncture, and only then, did Spencer establish his \u201cabsolute control of the property,\u201d <em>Mason, </em>200 Va. at 256, 105 S.E.2d at 151, and thereby sever Smith\u2019s control.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">We also find that this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Broody v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 281, 429 S.E.2d 468 (1993), is apposite on its facts. In <em>Broody, </em>the defendant and a companion followed the victim, Mrs. Lee, into her motel room and took the victim\u2019s purse. <em>Id. </em>at 283, 429 S.E.2d at 470. After the defendant took possession of the purse, he fled with Mrs. Lee in pursuit. <em>Id. </em>The defendant threw the purse to his accomplice who then threw it back to the defendant who \u201cfumbled\u201d it. <em>Id. </em>The purse dropped to the ground, evidencing the defendant\u2019s absence of absolute control over the property. <em>See Mason, </em>200 Va. at 256, 105 S.E.2d at 151. The Court held that the victim had constructive possession of the purse as it lay on the ground and that the force then used by the defendant to take it from her constituted robbery. <em>Broady, </em>16 Va.App. at 289, 429 S.E.2d at 473. Similarly, the victim here maintained constructive possession because she resisted the taking and remained in close proximity to the car. The force used in order to complete the asportation was sufficient to sustain the charge of carjacking.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>Finally, we note that Spencer\u2019s reliance on <em>Mason </em>is misplaced. In <em>Mason, </em>the evidence showed that the thief had completed the taking and asportation before the use of violence. Before the owner of the property confronted the defendant and violence occurred, the defendant transported the property to an accomplice who absconded with it; absolute control over the property in the defendant was therefore established before force or intimidation was exerted. <em>Mason, </em>200 Va. at 256-57, 105 S.E.2d at 151-52; <em>see also Jones, </em>267 Va. at 289-90, 591 S.E.2d at 71-72, 2004 Va. Lexis 25, *6-7 (distinguishing <em>Mason </em>on the ground that the asportation was complete when force was exerted). Here, the taking and asportation of Smith\u2019s car was not complete until after Spencer bumped her out of his path, and Smith did not relinquish possession and control of the vehicle until that juncture.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See Beard v. Commonwealth, </em>19 Va.App. 359, 363, 451 S.E.2d 698, 700 (1994) (\u201cWhere violence or intimidation is part of a continuous transaction collateral to the ... asportation, the point in time ... in which the asportation has removed the property from the victim\u2019s absolute control so that the continued removal of the property constitutes an escape rather than a taking defies a bright line test.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">In short, the trial court here concluded that Smith was still in possession of her car when Spencer exerted force to take it from her possession and control, and the evidence fully supports this conclusion. <em>See Martin, </em>4 Va.App. at 443, 358 S.E.2d at 418.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the decision of the trial court. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b502-8\">. The Commonwealth does not argue that, by analogy to the crime of robbery, the evidence was sufficient to sustain the conviction because Smith\u2019s car was taken \u201cfrom her presence.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Person v. Commonwealth, </em>10 Va.App. 36, 40, 389 S.E.2d 907, 910 (1990) (finding that, \"because the five dollar bill was in [the victim\u2019s] presence at the inception of the robbery, this was sufficient to prove that it was taken from her presence\u201d). Accordingly, we will not address the issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
