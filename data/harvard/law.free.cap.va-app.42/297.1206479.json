BENTON, JR.</author>\n<p id=\"b348-11\">Genesis Health Ventures, Inc. filed an application for a hearing that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission rejected because it did not comply with the commission\u2019s Rule 1.4(E). Genesis contends that the commission\u2019s decision unjustly enriched Patricia Pugh and, thus, was contrary to <em>Lam v. Kawneer Company, Inc., </em>38 Va.App. 515, 566 S.E.2d 874 (2002). We affirm the commission\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-13\">The facts are not complicated. Pugh sustained an injury by accident on July 20, 2000 while employed by Genesis. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>Approving the parties\u2019 memorandum of agreement, the commission awarded Pugh temporary total disability benefits in September 2000. Nine months later, in June 2001, the commission notified Genesis\u2019s insurer that the award was outstanding and that the commission assumed payments were continuing. The commission\u2019s letter also advised that if payments had ceased, either a termination of award document or application for hearing \u201cmust be filed to end the award.\u201d A year later, the commission sent an identical letter of notification to Genesis\u2019s insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">In August 2002, Genesis filed an application for hearing, which indicated Pugh had returned to work on July 31, 2000. The application requested termination of the award and indicated that Genesis had paid compensation under the award through July 30, 2000. The commission\u2019s claims specialist rejected the application because \u201cit fail[ed] to conform to the requirements of Rule 1.4\u201d and \u201cinstruct[ed] the [insurance] carrier to immediately reinstate compensation benefits ... under the ... outstanding award.\u201d On review, the commission affirmed the claims specialist\u2019s action.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">The commission\u2019s procedures for an application for hearing are specified in Rule 1.4. In pertinent part, the rule provides that \u201c[n]o change in condition application under [Code] \u00a7 65.2-708 ... shall be accepted unless filed within two years from the date compensation was last paid pursuant to an award.\u201d Rule 1.4(E). This rule governs Genesis\u2019s application for hearing, which was grounded in a change in condition and sought to terminate \u201cthe compensation previously awarded.\u201d Code \u00a7 65.2-708.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">As required by Rule 1.4(B), Genesis\u2019s application, which was filed August 20, 2002, informed the commission that \u201ccompensation was paid [to Pugh] through 07/30/2000 at the rate of $355.20 per week.\u201d The commission, therefore, properly concluded that the application was not \u201cfiled within two years from the date compensation was last paid pursuant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>[the] award\u201d and, likewise, properly rejected the application because it did not satisfy the requirement of Rule 1.4(E). Notwithstanding its clear violation of the commission\u2019s rule, Genesis contends that our <em>Lam </em>decision required the commission to disregard Genesis\u2019s failure to comply with the rules. We disagree with Genesis\u2019s reading of <em>Lam.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">Unlike Pugh, who returned to work for Genesis \u2014 her pre-injury employer, Lam did not return to work for his preinjury employer. Highlighting the circumstance of Lam\u2019s return to work for another employer, we noted that when \u201cthe insurer requested [Lam] to provide the name of his current employer, the date he started working, and copies of his pay stubs ... [, Lam] did not respond.\u201d 38 Va.App. at 517, 566 S.E.2d at 875. Lam\u2019s failure to respond to the request was a significant factor in the commission\u2019s decision for three reasons. First, the employer\u2019s \u201capplication for [a hearing to] terminat[e] ... benefits must be based on documentation \u2018sufficient to support a finding of probable cause to believe [the] ... grounds for relief are meritorious.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 519 n. 3, 566 S.E.2d at 876 n. 3. Because Lam\u2019s employer lacked specific information about where he was employed and his rate of pay, the employer had insufficient documentation to support its application. Second, Lam \u201cdid not dispute that he neglected to comply with the notice requirements of \u00a7 65.2-712.\u201d <em>Lam, </em>38 Va.App. at 519, 566 S.E.2d at 876. In pertinent part, this statute imposes upon an employee \u201ca duty immediately to disclose to the employer ... [the employee\u2019s] return to work\u201d and authorizes the commission to remedy a breach of that duty. Code \u00a7 65.2-712. Third, in <em>Lam </em>the employer sought information from Lam that would have permitted it, had Lam cooperated, to timely file an agreement to terminate the award. Thus, the commission found no evidence to suggest the employer had \u201cflaunted\u201d the rules by its delay. 38 Va.App. at 519, 566 S.E.2d at 876.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">None of these circumstances exists in this case. Genesis knew Pugh had returned to work for Genesis and, thus, had available all information and documentation necessary to com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>p\u00edete its application for hearing. Moreover, for more than a year, Genesis failed to respond to a notice from the commission advising it about the need to terminate the outstanding award. On the other hand, the record contains no evidence that Pugh violated any duty required of her by the rules or the Act. Indeed, when she returned to her pre-injury employment, Genesis had the notice that Code \u00a7 65.2-712 requires of an employee. <em>See Washington Metro. Area Transit v. Rogers, </em>17 Va.App. 657, 661, 440 S.E.2d 142, 145 (1994) (affirming the commission\u2019s finding \u201cthat the claimant\u2019s return to work for the pre-injury employer was actual notice which satisfied the disclosure requirement of Code \u00a7 65.2-712\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\">The commission found that the record in this case contains \u201cno allegation of or evidence of imposition.\u201d <em>Cf. McFadden v. The Carpet House, </em>42 Va.App. 302, 591 S.E.2d 708, 2004 WL 76333 (2004) (discussing the commission\u2019s application of the doctrine of imposition in <em>Lam); Washington v. United Parcel Service, </em>39 Va.App. 772, 780-81, 576 S.E.2d 791, 796 (2003) (noting that application of the doctrine of imposition was appropriate where \u201cno evidence shows that [the employer] intentionally failed to file the appropriate paperwork requesting termination of the award, ... [and the evidence shows] that [the employer] had mailed [to the employee] the \u2018termination of wage loss, the Agreed Statement of Fact\u2019 forms, ... but they \u2018never got them back\u2019 \u201d). Credible evidence in the record supports the commission\u2019s finding and the commission\u2019s ruling \u201cthat the holding in <em>Lam </em>is inapplicable here.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">For these reasons, we affirm the commission\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
