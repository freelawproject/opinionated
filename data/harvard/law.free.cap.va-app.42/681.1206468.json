On appeal, he contends the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to support his conviction because the Commonwealth did not prove he had the present ability to inflict actual violence upon the officer. On September 9, 2003, a divided panel of this Court affirmed Carter\u2019s conviction, holding the evidence was sufficient to convict Carter of assaulting a police officer because Carter\u2019s conduct \u201creasonably and unequivocally\u201d indicated to the officer that Carter had \u201can intention and the present ability to harm the officer.\u201d <em>Carter v. Commonwealth, </em>41 Va.App. 448, 451, 585 S.E.2d 848, 851 (2003). On October 14, 2003, we granted Carter\u2019s petition for a rehearing en banc, stayed the mandate of the panel decision, and rein<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>stated the appeal. Upon rehearing en banc, we affirm Carter\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">\u201cUnder familiar principles of appellate review, we view the evidence and all reasonable inferences fairly deducible from that evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the party that prevailed below.\u201d <em>Banks v. Commonwealth, </em>41 Va.App. 539, 543, 586 S.E.2d 876, 877 (2003). So viewed, the evidence presented to the trial court established that, on December 29, 1998, around 11:00 p.m., Officer B.N. O\u2019Donnell of the City of Charlottesville Police Department observed a speeding car and, activating his vehicle\u2019s overhead flashing blue emergency lights, initiated a traffic stop. O\u2019Donnell, who was on routine patrol at the time in a high crime area of the city, was driving a marked police vehicle and wearing his police uniform and badge. After the car pulled over, O\u2019Donnell shone his vehicle\u2019s \u201ctake down\u201d lights and spotlight onto the car and approached it on foot.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">Two people were inside the car, the driver and Carter, who was seated in the front passenger seat. O\u2019Donnell initiated a conversation with the driver, asking for his driver\u2019s license and registration and informing him why he had been stopped. The driver responded to O\u2019Donnell in a \u201chostile\u201d tone of voice. While conversing with the driver, O\u2019Donnell used his flashlight to conduct a \u201cplain view search\u201d of the car to make sure there were no visible weapons or drugs in it. O\u2019Donnell noticed that Carter had his right hand out of sight \u201cdown by his right leg.\u201d Carter then suddenly brought his right hand up and across his body. Extending the index finger on his right hand straight out and the thumb straight up, he pointed his index finger at the officer and said, \u201cPow.\u201d Thinking Carter \u201chad a weapon and was going to shoot\u201d him, O\u2019Donnell \u201cbegan to move backwards\u201d and went for his weapon. A \u201csplit second\u201d later, O\u2019Donnell realized \u201cit was only [Carter\u2019s] finger.\u201d O\u2019Donnell testified: \u201cThe first thing I thought was that I was going to get shot. I \u2014 it\u2019s a terrifying experience, and if I could have gotten my weapon, I would have shot him.\u201d Immediately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>after the incident, O\u2019Donnell, who was \u201cvisibly shaken,\u201d asked Carter \u201cif he thought it was funny,\u201d and Carter responded, \u2018Yes, I think it is funny.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">At the conclusion of the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence at trial and at the close of all the evidence, Carter moved to strike the evidence, arguing the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence was insufficient to prove assault because it failed to prove Carter had the present ability to inflict actual violence upon the officer. The Commonwealth responded that proof of such ability was unnecessary as long as the evidence proved the officer reasonably believed Carter had the present ability to inflict actual bodily harm upon him.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">The trial court agreed with the Commonwealth. Finding Carter\u2019s \u201cact of pointing what the officer believed at the time to be a weapon at him\u201d did, \u201cin fact, place Officer O\u2019Donnell in reasonable apprehension or fear,\u201d the trial court found the evidence sufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Carter was guilty of assault. Thus, the trial court denied Carter\u2019s motion to strike the evidence and subsequently convicted him of assaulting a police officer, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-57(C). At sentencing, the court imposed a sentence of three years, suspending two years and six months.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-7\">This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-8\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b735-9\">Code \u00a7 18.2-57(0 provides, in pertinent part, that \u201cany person [who] commits an assault ... against ... a law-enforcement officer ... engaged in the performance of his public duties as such ... shall be guilty of a Class 6 felony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b735-10\">On appeal, Carter asserts the Commonwealth failed to prove his conduct constituted an assault of a law-enforcement officer because, in pointing his finger at the officer and saying \u201cpow,\u201d he did not have the present ability to inflict harm upon the officer, as required under the common law definition of assault. Thus, he contends, the trial court erred, as a matter of law, in finding the evidence sufficient to sustain a conviction for assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>In response, the Commonwealth contends that, under long-established Virginia case law, a defendant need not have had the present ability to inflict harm at the time of the offense to be guilty of assault. It is enough, the Commonwealth argues, that, as in this case, the defendant\u2019s conduct created in the mind of the victim a reasonable fear or apprehension of bodily harm. Accordingly, the Commonwealth concludes, the trial court properly found the evidence sufficient to convict Carter of assaulting a police officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">In determining whether the trial court correctly ruled that Carter\u2019s conduct constituted an assault, we are faced with a mixed question of law and fact. We review the trial court\u2019s legal conclusions <em>de novo </em>while giving deference to the trial court\u2019s findings of fact unless the findings are \u201cplainly wrong or without evidence to support them.\u201d <em>Timbers v. Commonwealth, </em>28 Va.App. 187, 193, 503 S.E.2d 233, 235-36 (1998). Moreover, as previously stated, we consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth. <em>See Banks, </em>41 Va.App. at 543, 586 S.E.2d at 877.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">While statutorily proscribed and regulated, <em>see </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-57, the offense of assault is defined by common law in Virginia. <em>See Zimmerman v. Commonwealth, </em>266 Va. 384, 387, 585 S.E.2d 538, 539 (2003) (\u201cIn this jurisdiction, we adhere to the common law definition of assault, there having been no statutory change to the crime.\u201d). At common law, the term \u201cassault\u201d originally had two distinct meanings, one when used in the context of criminal law and another when used in the context of torts law. <em>See </em>Rollin M. Perkins, <em>Perkins on Criminal Law </em>114 (2d ed. 1969). A criminal assault was \u201can attempt to commit a battery.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Under this definition of assault, it did not matter \u201cwhether the victim was put in fear or was even aware of the assault.\u201d Roger D. Groot, <em>Criminal Offenses and Defenses in Virginia </em>48 (2004). It mattered only that the accused had the specific intent and present ability to commit the battery and \u201cperformed some direct, ineffectual act towards its commission.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b737-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>Conversely, a tortious assault was an overt, intentional act that placed another in reasonable apprehension of immediate bodily harm. Perkins, <em>supra. </em>Under this definition, an assault was \u201can offer to batter\u201d and did not require proof of an \u201cactual, overt attempt to batter.\u201d Groot, <em>supra. </em>Instead, it required \u201cproof of a threat, actual or implied, to batter and an apparent present ability to do so.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 48-49 (footnote omitted). \u201cActual ability to carry out the threat [was] not required because this form of assault tum[ed] on the victim\u2019s apprehension of harm; apparent ability [was] sufficient to create apprehension.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 49; <em>see also </em>Wayne R. LaFave, <em>Criminal Law </em>\u00a7 7.16, at 746 (3d ed. 2000) (observing that proof of a present ability to batter was \u201cclearly unnecessary\u201d for this type of assault). It did require, though, \u201csome physical act which proffer[ed] imminent unwanted force.\u201d John L. Costello, <em>Virginia Criminal Law and Procedure </em>\u00a7 4.2 (3d ed. 2002) (emphasis omitted). Additionally, absent an intention to batter, there must have been \u201can actual intention to cause apprehension.\u201d LaFave, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 7.16, at 747 (citing W. Page Keeton et al., <em>Keeton &amp; Prosser on the Law of Torts </em>\u00a7 10 (5th ed. 1984)). \u201cThe apprehension must [have been] one which would normally be aroused in the mind of a reasonable person.\u201d Keeton, <em>supra; see also </em>LaFave, <em>supra </em>(noting that \u201cconduct of the sort to arouse a reasonable apprehension of bodily harm\u201d was required).</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">In time, however, the tort type of assault, putting the victim in reasonable apprehension of bodily harm, became recognized, \u201cin addition to (not as an alternative to) the attempted-battery type of assault,\u201d as a criminal assault at common law. LaFave, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 7.16, at 746 (emphasis omitted); <em>see also </em>Groot, <em>supra, </em>at 48; Perkins, <em>supra, </em>at 116. Indeed, Blackstone observed in his discussion regarding \u201cprivate wrongs\u201d that a tortious injury may be committed</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-6\">by threats and menaces of bodily hurt, <em>through fear of which a man\u2019s business is interrupted. </em>A menace alone, without a consequent inconvenience, makes not the injury, but to complete the wrong there must be both of them <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>together. The remedy for this is in pecuniary damages, ... this being inchoate, though not an absolute violence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">3 William Blackstone, <em>Commentaries </em>*120 (emphasis added). He then noted in his subsequent discussion regarding \u201cpublic wrongs\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-6\">I have nothing farther to add to what has already been observed [concerning assaults] in the preceding book of these commentaries; when we considered them as private wrongs.... But, taken in a public light, as a breach of the king\u2019s peace, an affront to his government, and a damage done to his subjects, they are also indictable and punishable with fine and imprisonment; or with other ignominious corporal penalties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b738-7\">4 <em>id. </em>at *216-17.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-8\">In <em>Commonwealth v. White, </em>110 Mass. 407 (1872), an early, leading case illustrative of the common law definition of assault, the defendant, who had pointed a purportedly unloaded gun at the frightened victim, asked the trial court to instruct the jury that, to be guilty of assault, he must have had an intention to do some bodily harm to the victim and the present ability to execute that intention. <em>Id. </em>at 407. Instead, the court instructed the jury that \u201can assault is any unlawful physical force partly or fully put in motion, which creates a reasonable apprehension of immediate physical injury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In approving the instruction, the appellate court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-9\">It is not the secret intent of the assaulting party, nor the undisclosed fact of his ability or inability to commit a battery, that is material; but what his conduct and the attending circumstances denote at the time to the party assaulted. If to him they indicate an attack, he is justified in resorting to defensive action. The same rule applies to the proof necessary to sustain a criminal complaint for an assault. It is the outward demonstration that constitutes the mischief which is punished as a breach of the peace.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ae9\"><em>Id. </em>at 409.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-10\">Assault has, thus, long been defined at common law \u201cas being (1) an attempt to commit a battery or (2) an intentional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>placing of another in [reasonable] apprehension of receiving an immediate battery.\u201d Perkins, <em>supra, </em>at 114. Today, most jurisdictions include both of these separate types of assault, attempted battery and putting the victim in reasonable apprehension, within the scope of criminal assault. Perkins, <em>supra, </em>at 116-17; LaFave, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 7.16, at 745.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">In Virginia, our Supreme Court has long recognized the existence of both concepts of assault in the criminal-law context. In <em>Lynch v. Commonwealth, </em>131 Va. 769, 109 S.E. 418 (1921), the Supreme Court, in clarifying its earlier reversal of an assault conviction in <em>Berkeley v. Commonwealth, </em>88 Va. 1017, 14 S.E. 916 (1892), stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-6\"><em>Berkeley\u2019s Case, </em>88 Va. 1017, 14 S.E. 916, ... was a prosecution for an assault. It is true that the opinion of the court in that case quotes with approval extracts from Davis Cr. Law and Russell on Crimes, in which the statement is made that \u201cto constitute an assault, there must be present ability to inflict an injury,\u201d yet, as indicated in the very extracts quoted, this statement is subject to the qualification that if the threatened conduct is such that it puts the person assailed in such apparent peril as to create in him the reasonable belief that he is in peril, the assault will be complete, although it may be that the person making the assault did not in truth have the present ability to inflict the threatened injury. As said in Bish. New Cr. Law (8th ed.), sec. 32, on the subject of what constitutes an assault: \u201cThere is no need for the party assailed to be put in actual peril, if only a well-founded apprehension is created. For his suffering is the same in the one case as in the other, and the breach of the public peace is the same. To illustrate: ... If, within shooting distance, one menacingly points at another with a gun, apparently loaded, yet not in fact, he commits an assault the same as if it were loaded.\u201d Thereupon, Mr. Bishop proceeds to lay down what is undoubtedly the correct rule on the subject, in the following words: \u201cThere must be some power, actual or apparent, of doing bodily harm; but apparent power is sufficient. In the instance we are referring to, the person assaulted is really <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>put in fear.... It has been said that the gun must be within shooting distance; but plainly if it is not, yet seems to be so to the person assaulted, or danger otherwise appears imminent, it will be sufficient.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-5\">It appears from the opinion in <em>Berkeley\u2019s Case </em>that the [victim] himself testified that the accused \u201cdid not attempt to strike\u201d him. Hence, it affirmatively appeared that the [victim] was never put in any apparent peril or apprehension of bodily harm. And the court correctly held, under those circumstances, that the charge of the assault was not sustained by the evidence. Plainly, therefore, the case does not hold, as is claimed for the accused in the case before us, that, to constitute an attempt, the overt act must, in all cases, be accompanied with the present ability on the part of the actor to accomplish the actual thing attempted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b740-6\"><em>Lynch, </em>131 Va. at 774-75, 109 S.E. at 420.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-7\">In <em>Burgess v. Commonwealth, </em>136 Va. 697, 118 S.E. 273 (1923), the Supreme Court was asked to review the propriety of a jury instruction defining assault in a case \u201cwhere there [was] no battery, but the overt act done put[] the party assailed in well founded fear of bodily harm.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 708, 118 S.E. at 276. In that case, the evidence proved (1) that the defendant fired his pistol intending to create the apprehension in the victim\u2019s mind that the shots were intended to strike him and (2) that the victim believed the defendant was shooting at him. <em>Id. </em>at 705-06, 118 S.E. at 275. Faced with the specific issue of whether, under the common law, the crime of assault included the put-in-apprehension type of tortious assault or was limited to the attempted-battery type of assault, the Court sustained the jury instruction, stating as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-8\">The instruction under consideration, therefore, presents the question on which there is a sharp and irreconcilable conflict in the authorities on the subject; diametrically opposed positions being taken by the authorities, namely: (a) That it is sufficient to constitute an assault that the party assailed is put in well founded fear or apprehension of bodily harm, although the assailant has in fact no intention to strike the party assailed and the latter is not in fact put <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>in actual peril; and (b), that (where there is no battery) the putting of the party assailed in actual peril is essential to constitute an assault upon him. And since in a criminal prosecution for assault the existence of a criminal intent on the part of the accused is essential to his guilt, as corollary to the opposing views of such respective lines of decision, such lines of decision respectively hold: (c) That to render one guilty of the offense of an assault, it is sufficient that the act done is with the intent to put the party assailed in fear or apprehension of bodily harm, and that by the act he is in fact put in well founded fear or apprehension of such harm; and, (d) that to render one thus guilty, it is essential that the act done must be with the intent to do bodily harm to the party assailed, and the latter (where there is no battery) must be put in actual peril of bodily harm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-5\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-6\">... We think that, both in reason and in accordance with the great weight of modern authority, the positions (a) and (c), aforesaid, embody the correct doctrine on the subject.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AN0\"><em>Id. </em>at 706-07, 118 S.E. at 275-76. In rejecting the notion that the victim must be put in actual peril and that the act must be done with the intent to do bodily harm to the victim, the Court quoted with approval these statements from 5 C.J. (5), 3, at 618:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-7\">The better rule is that the defendant\u2019s intention [to do actual bodily harm] does not enter into the case, for if reasonable fear of bodily harm has been caused by the conduct of the defendant, this is an assault, even though he disclaims any intention to do wrong____But even granting the necessity of some intent to injure, it has been held that the intended injury may be to the mind and feelings as well as to the body.... Apparent present ability [to do physical violence] ... has been held to be sufficient; defendant need not be in striking distance or within arm\u2019s reach [of the party assailed],</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b741-10\"><em>Burgess, </em>136 Va. at 707-08, 118 S.E. at 276 (emphases omitted) (alterations in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>Likewise, in <em>Merritt v. Commonwealth, </em>164 Va. 653, 180 S.E. 395 (1935), the Supreme Court stated that, \u201c \u2018[i]n order to constitute an assault there must be an overt act or an attempt, <em>or the unequivocal appearance of an attempt, </em>with force and violence, to do physical injury to the person of another.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 658, 180 S.E. at 397 (emphasis added) (quoting 2 R.C.L. 533). More recently, the Supreme Court stated in <em>Commonwealth v. Vaughn, </em>263 Va. 31, 35, 557 S.E.2d 220, 222 (2002), that \u201cthe intent to put another in fear of bodily harm with a threat to use bodily force ... is an assault.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">It is clear, then, that, under <em>Lynch, Burgess, Merritt, </em>and <em>Vaughn, </em>a present ability to inflict bodily harm upon the victim is not an essential element of criminal assault in all cases. Indeed, under those cases, to be guilty of the tort type of criminal assault, a defendant need have only an apparent present ability to inflict harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">Carter argues, however, that the phrase \u201ccoupled with a present ability\u201d in the common law definition of assault in <em>Harper v. Commonwealth, </em>196 Va. 723, 733, 85 S.E.2d 249, 255 (1955), means that one must, in all cases, have a present ability to inflict harm upon the victim to be guilty of assault. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-7\">In <em>Harper, </em>the Supreme Court quoted the following passage from J.A.G. Davis, <em>Criminal Law </em>353-54 (1838) (emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-8\">\u201cAn assault is an attempt or offer, with force and violence, to do some bodily hurt to another, whether from wantonness or malice, by means calculated to produce the end if carried into execution; as by striking at him with a stick or other weapon, or without a weapon, though he be not struck, or even by raising up the arm or a cane in a menacing manner, by throwing a bottle of glass with an intent to strike, by levelling a gun at another within a distance from which, supposing it to be loaded, the contents might injure, or any similar act accompanied with circumstances denoting an intention coupled <em>with a present ability, </em>of using actual violence against the person of another. But no words <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>whatever, be they ever so provoking, can amount to an assault....\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b743-4\"><em>Harper, </em>196 Va. at 733, 85 S.E.2d at 255. In our view, this quote from <em>Harper </em>does not indicate that the Supreme Court was undertaking, in that case, to define the offense of assault in its entirety. Moreover, it is apparent from the context that this was not the Court\u2019s intention.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">The relevant question to be decided in <em>Harper </em>was whether the trial court had erred in amending a jury instruction on self-defense requested by the defendant, who was convicted by the jury of assault and battery. <em>Id. </em>at 729, 85 S.E.2d at 253. After holding that the trial court did not err and stating the reasons for its decision, the Court stated, as an aside, that another instruction given at the defendant\u2019s request and not at issue in the case was \u201cmore favorable to him than a statement of the correct principles of self-defense would have been.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 732, 85 S.E.2d at 255. That granted instruction, the Court added, was \u201cerroneous\u201d because it incorrectly</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AuE\">told the jury in effect that if they believed that [the victim] with a knife in his hand \u201cangrily\u201d cursed the accused and acted in a threatening manner, the accused was justified in striking [him] with a deadly weapon. This is not the law. In order to justify an accused in striking another with a deadly weapon, as the accused admits he did in this case, a threatening attitude alon[e] affords no justification. The adversary must have made some overt act indicative of imminent danger to the accused at the time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b743-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 733, 85 S.E.2d at 255. The same principle, the Court said, is expressed in the passage quoted from Davis\u2019s treatise, upon which Carter relies in this case. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b743-7\">It is clear, therefore, that the common law definition of assault set forth in <em>Harper </em>was not intended to be an all-inclusive definition of assault in Virginia. Rather, it was intended solely to support the proposition that, to justify the use of a deadly weapon in self-defense when assaulted by another, there must have been an overt act by the other person that led the defendant to reasonably believe he was in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>imminent danger of losing his life or suffering serious bodily injury \u2014 words and a \u201cthreatening attitude\u201d are not, by themselves, enough. In other words, it must have reasonably appeared to the defendant that the other person had a present ability to inflict serious bodily harm upon him.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">We conclude, therefore, that the definition of assault contained in <em>Harper </em>did not, as Carter would have us find, supersede or otherwise annul the common law definition of assault set forth in <em>Lynch </em>and <em>Burgess. </em>Indeed, as used in <em>Harper, </em>the subject definition accords more with the tort concept of criminal assault recognized in <em>Lynch </em>and <em>Burgess </em>than with the attempted-battery concept, which does not require that the victim even be aware of the assault, much less the defendant\u2019s present ability to inflict harm upon him. <em>See also </em>Perkins, <em>supra, </em>at 122 (noting that, in jurisdictions that have extended the scope of the crime of assault to include the tort concept of assault, references in definitions of assault to \u201csuch circumstances as denote at the time an intention, coupled with a present ability\u201d allude to circumstances that are indicative of either an actual or reasonably apparent present ability).</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">Moreover, as previously discussed, the two types of criminal assault recognized at common law \u2014 attempted assault and putting the victim in reasonable apprehension of bodily harm \u2014 are separate and distinct forms of the same offense. They have different elements and are, thus, defined differently and applied under different circumstances. Hence, the use of the common law definition of assault contained in <em>Harper </em>in a case requiring determination of whether an attempted-battery type of criminal assault occurred, <em>see, e.g., Zimmerman, </em>266 Va. at 387, 585 S.E.2d at 539; <em>Bennett v. Commonwealth, </em>35 Va.App. 442, 449, 546 S.E.2d 209, 212 (2001), does not, as Carter implicitly suggests, negate the applicability of the definition of assault contained in <em>Lynch </em>and <em>Burgess </em>in a case, like the instant one, involving solely a tort type of criminal assault. Such use, therefore, does not constitute a rejection of <em>Lynch </em>and <em>Burgess, </em>which remain good law.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>For theses reasons, we hold that, under the common law definition of assault, one need not, in cases such as this, have a present ability to inflict imminent bodily harm at the time of the alleged offense to be guilty of assault. It is enough that one\u2019s conduct created at the time of the alleged offense a reasonable apprehension of bodily harm in the mind of the victim. Thus, an apparent present ability to inflict imminent bodily harm is sufficient to support a conviction for assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">In this case, the trial court found that Carter\u2019s \u201cact of pointing what the officer believed at the time to be a weapon at him\u201d did, \u201cin fact, place Officer O\u2019Donnell in reasonable apprehension or fear.\u201d The evidence in the record abundantly supports this finding, and the finding is not plainly wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">After pulling over a speeding vehicle at night, Officer O\u2019Donnell approached the vehicle and asked to see the driver\u2019s license and registration. The driver responded in a \u201chostile\u201d manner. Using his flashlight, O\u2019Donnell conducted a \u201cplain view search\u201d of the car for visible weapons and drugs. O\u2019Donnell saw that Carter had his right hand out of sight \u201cdown by his right leg.\u201d Carter then suddenly brought his right hand, which he had fashioned in the form of a handgun, up and across his body, pointed it at the officer, and said, \u201cPow.\u201d Thinking Carter \u201chad a weapon and was going to shoot\u201d him, O\u2019Donnell \u201cbegan to move backwards\u201d and went for his weapon. A \u201csplit second\u201d later, O\u2019Donnell realized- \u201cit was only [Carter\u2019s] finger.\u201d O\u2019Donnell testified that he thought he was \u201cgoing to get shot.\u201d It was, he said, \u201ca terrifying experience, and if I could have gotten my weapon, I would have shot him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b745-7\">The trial court could reasonably conclude from these facts that the officer was terrified and thought he was about to be shot. That the officer\u2019s terror was brief does not alter the fact, as found by the trial court, that the officer believed for a moment that Carter had the intention and present ability to kill him. Moreover, under the circumstances surrounding the incident, we cannot say, as a matter of law, that such a belief was unreasonable. Thus, although Carter did not have a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>weapon, the trial court could properly conclude from the evidence presented that Carter had an apparent present ability to inflict imminent bodily harm and that his conduct placed Officer O\u2019Donnell in reasonable apprehension of such harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">Hence, the trial court did not err, as a matter of law, in finding the evidence sufficient to convict Carter of assault under the common law tort definition of assault that has long been recognized as a part of the definition of criminal assault in Virginia. Accordingly, we affirm Carter\u2019s conviction for assault under Code \u00a7 18.2-57(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b746-7\">BENTON, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Aih\">with whom FITZPATRICK, C.J., joins, dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-8\">Whatever doubt may have existed about the definition of assault in Virginia should have been dispelled by the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Zimmerman v. Commonwealth, </em>266 Va. 384, 585 S.E.2d 538 (2003). Affirming a conviction for assault on a law enforcement officer, the Court reaffirmed the longstanding definition of the crime of assault.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-9\">In this jurisdiction, we adhere to the common law definition of assault, there having been no statutory change to the crime. In order to constitute an assault, there must be an attempt with force and violence, to do some bodily hurt to another, whether from wantonness or malice, <em>by means calculated to produce the end if carried into execution; </em>it is any act accompanied with circumstances denoting an intention, <em>coupled with a present ability, </em>to use actual violence against another person. <em>Harper v. Commonwealth, </em>196 Va. 723, 733, 85 S.E.2d 249, 255 (1955). <em>See Commonwealth v. Vaughn, </em>263 Va. 31, 35, 557 S.E.2d 220, 222 (2002) (\u201cintent to put another in fear of bodily harm with a threat to use bodily force ... is an assault\u201d).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-10\">An assault requires an overt act or an attempt, or the unequivocal appearance of an attempt, with force and violence, to do physical injury to the person of another. <em>Merritt v. Commonwealth, </em>164 Va. 653, 658, 180 S.E. 395, 397 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>(1935). There is no requirement that a victim be physically touched to be assaulted. <em>Harper, </em>196 Va. at 733, 85 S.E.2d at 255 (assault occurs \u201cthough [the victim] be not struck\u201d).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b747-5\"><em>Zimmerman, </em>266 Va. at 387, 585 S.E.2d at 539 (emphasis added).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">This definition comports with the usual common law standard because \u201cin the early law a criminal assault was an attempt to commit a battery and that only.\u201d Rollin M. Perkins, <em>Criminal Law </em>159 (3d ed. 1982).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Consistent with this view, the common law of assault that the Court reiterated in <em>Zimmerman </em>has long been defined in Virginia as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ANj\">\u201cAn assault is an attempt or offer, with force and violence, to do some bodily hurt to another, whether from wantonness or malice, by means calculated to produce the end if carried into execution; as by striking at him with a stick or other weapon, or without a weapon, though he be not struck, or even by raising up the arm or a cane in a menacing manner, by throwing a bottle of glass with an intent to strike, by levelling a gun at another within a distance from which, supposing it to be loaded, the contents might injure, or any similar act accompanied with circumstances denoting an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>intention coupled <em>with a present ability, </em>of using actual violence against the person of another. But no words whatever, be they ever so provoking, can amount to an assault; * * *\u201d. (Italics supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b748-5\"><em>Harper, </em>196 Va. at 733, 85 S.E.2d at 255 (citation omitted). <em>See also Berkeley v. Commonwealth, </em>88 Va. 1017, 1017-18, 14 S.E. 916, 916 (1892). Thus, I do not agree with the majority opinion\u2019s Thesis that the common law of criminal assault, as applied in Virginia, excludes the requirement that the Commonwealth prove the accused acted \u201cby means calculated to produce the end if carried into execution\u201d or prove the accused\u2019s intention was \u201ccoupled with a present ability ... to use actual violence.\u201d <em>Zimmerman, </em>266 Va. at 387, 585 S.E.2d at 539.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">The majority opinion cites <em>Lynch v. Commonwealth, </em>131 Va. 769, 109 S.E. 418 (1921), as authority for the proposition that Virginia law recognizes a tort law definition of assault as an alternative, separate type of assault under the criminal law. A cursory review of <em>Lynch </em>demonstrates, however, that the case involves an appeal of a conviction for \u201coffering ardent spirits for sale,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 771, 109 S.E. at 419, and that \u201c[t]he sole question presented ... for decision ... is ... [whether] the ability, at the time an offer to sell ardent spirits is made, to complete the sale in accordance with the offer, [is] an essential element of the statutory offense of offering ardent spirits for sale.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Deciding that question, the Supreme Court held that the statute at issue did not render \u201c[t]he actual lack of such ability ... any ground of defense to the person making the offer,\u201d <em>id., </em>and that the statute proscribed a verbal proposal, without the need to prove more. <em>Id. </em>at 773, 109 S.E. at 419. The Court also noted that the statute did not apply to an offer that was a joke, <em>id. </em>at 772, 109 S.E. at 419. Thus, while the discussion about assault in <em>Lynch </em>is an interesting one, it is clearly <em>dicta.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b748-7\">The majority opinion also cites <em>Burgess v. Commonwealth, </em>136 Va. 697, 118 S.E. 273 (1923), for the same proposition. The issue in <em>Burgess, </em>however, was revealed by the Supreme Court to be the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>Was instruction No. 1 erroneous, in that it told the jury, in substance, that if they believed from the evidence that the accused, \u201cbefore the officer was out of shooting distance,\u201d shot \u201cin such manner and under such circumstances as would naturally lead the officer to believe that the pistol was being shot at him and with intent to terrify the officer, they should find him guilty of simple assault, notwithstanding the accused had no intention to strike him.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">136 Va. at 705, 118 S.E. at 275. Thus, <em>Burgess </em>presented no occasion to discuss the requirement of \u201cpresent ability\u201d because its existence was not contested and the question as presented by the Court established the existence of present ability. The Court discussed and resolved the issue whether the jury was permitted to find that the act was committed under circumstances denoting the requisite intent of causing apprehension. <em>Id. </em>at 708, 118 S.E. at 276.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">Similarly, <em>Vaughn </em>does not support the majority opinion\u2019s thesis. In that case, the accused, who shot a person and was convicted of malicious wounding, complained that the jury should have been given an instruction on the lesser offense of assault and battery. 263 Va. at 33, 557 S.E.2d at 221. Obviously, in view of the gunshot wound, <em>Vaughn </em>presented no issue concerning the existence of \u201cpresent ability\u201d or the need to prove that circumstance; it tacitly recognized that \u201c \u2018[t]he threat to use deadly force by brandishing a deadly weapon has long been considered an assault.\u2019 \u201d 263 Va. at 35, 557 S.E.2d at 222 (quoting <em>Commonwealth v. Alexander, </em>260 Va. 238, 241, 531 S.E.2d 567, 568 (2000)). The discussion in <em>Vaughn </em>regarding assault concerned only the disputed issue of intent and led to the Court\u2019s holding that \u201c[a] finding of assault and battery by the jury in these circumstances would require denying the uncontroverted physical evidence and accepting Vaughn\u2019s failure to explain what occurred as affirmative evidence of lesser intent.\u201d 263 Va. at 36, 557 S.E.2d at 223.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-7\">A review of <em>Merritt v. Commonwealth, </em>164 Va. 653, 180 S.E. 395 (1935), which the majority also relies upon, reveals that the Court did not adopt a definition of assault for criminal prosecutions that excludes the requirement to find \u201cpresent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>ability\u201d or \u201cmeans calculated to produce the end.\u201d Noting that the indictment in <em>Merritt </em>\u201ccharged the accused with the commission of a crime by maliciously pointing a loaded gun at [a man], who was in shooting range,\u201d 164 Va. at 656, 180 S.E. at 397, the Court held that the indictment charged \u201can assault.\u201d In reaching that holding, the Court recited the usual definition of assault that incorporated the element of \u201cpresent ability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 658-59, 180 S.E. at 398. Indeed, when the Supreme Court reiterated this long standing definition in <em>Zimmerman, </em>it cited <em>Merritt </em>together with <em>Harper </em>and <em>Vaughn </em>as precedent. <em>See Zimmerman, </em>266 Va. at 387, 585 S.E.2d at 539.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">In the present case, the issue concerns whether the pointing of a finger while uttering the word \u201cpow\u201d is an act performed either \u201cby means calculated to produce the end if carried into execution\u201d or \u201cwith a present ability ... to use actual violence,\u201d which is a circumstance that must accompany the intention of the accused. <em>Zimmerman, </em>266 Va. at 387, 585 S.E.2d at 539. The police officer testified that the following occurred when he approached a car to issue a summons to the driver for speeding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-6\">[W]hen I first got to the vehicle and I initiated the conversation and was looking around, I noticed that the passenger[, Carter,] had his right hand down by his right leg. As I spoke with the driver, it was a sudden movement. [Carter\u2019s] arm came up. It arced up and across his body, like this____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-7\">He said, \u201cPow.\u201d And that was \u2014 I believed it to be a firearm. I believed he had a weapon and was going to shoot me at that point, until he said, \u201cPow,\u201d and then I realized that it was only his finger ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-8\">The first thing I thought was that I was going to get shot. I \u2014 it\u2019s a terrifying experience, and if I could have gotten my weapon, I would have shot him. But it\u2019s \u2014 it happens ... [in] a split second.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b750-9\">The officer testified that Carter then \u201cstarted laughing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b750-10\">The common law definition of \u201cassault\u201d as contained in <em>Zimmerman </em>does not encompass this type of intentional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>conduct, which is intended to startle but is performed without a present ability to produce the end if carried out. Because of the definitional limitations of this common law rule, other states have addressed this type of conduct by statutory enactments. \u201c[M]ost modern codes either include physical menacing in the crime of assault or else create a separate crime of \u2018menacing\u2019 or \u2018threatening\u2019 covering such conduct.\u201d Wayne R. LaFave, <em>Criminal Law </em>\u00a7 16.3(b), at 825 n. 21 (4th ed. 2003). When legislatures statutorily define a crime in this manner \u201c[f]or this type of assault, a present ability to inflict injury is clearly unnecessary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 825. <em>See, e.g., Williamson v. United States, </em>445 A.2d 975, 978 (D.C.App.1982) (holding that by statute an assault is established by proving \u201ca menacing threat, which may or may not be accompanied by a specific intent to injure\u201d); <em>Bacon v. Bacon, </em>567 N.W.2d 414, 418 (Iowa 1997) (holding that by statute the offender need only \u201chave the apparent ability to execute the act constituting the assault\u201d and that \u201c[t]he ability ... must be apparent to the offender, not the victim\u201d); <em>Barrios v. State, </em>118 Md.App. 384, 702 A.2d 961, 970 (1997) (noting that by statute Maryland provides for alternative forms of assault, one of which is \u201can assault of the intentional frightening variety ... [that only] require[s] in terms of perception ... an apparent present ability from the viewpoint of the threatened victim\u201d); <em>State v. Riley, </em>141 Vt. 29, 442 A.2d 1297, 1298 (1982) (noting that Vermont\u2019s assault statute, which is patterned on the Model Penal Code, \u201cwas intended to incorporate into the criminal law the civil notion of assault\u201d and to permit prosecution \u201cagainst a person who places another in fear of bodily injury, even if the alleged assailant acts without purpose to carry out the threat\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">For these reasons, I disagree with the majority opinion\u2019s holding that a conviction for criminal assault can be sustained in Virginia even though the evidence failed to prove the accused had a present ability to harm the officer. I would hold that Carter committed an \u201cact accompanied with circumstances denoting an intention\u201d to menace but it was not \u201ccoupled with a present ability ... to use actual violence\u201d or \u201ccalculated to produce the end if carried into execution.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number><em>Zimmerman, </em>266 Va. at 387, 585 S.E.2d at 539. <em>See, e.g., People v. Marceaux, </em>3 Cal.App.3d 613, 83 Cal.Rptr. 798, 803 (1970) (holding that \u201can assault conviction cannot be predicated upon an intent only to frighten\u201d); <em>People v. Vaiza, </em>244 Cal.App.2d 121, 52 Cal.Rptr. 733, 735 (1966) (holding that \u201c[i]f a person threatens to shoot another with ... a chocolate candy pistol, there is no ability to commit ... any injury with it on the person of another\u201d); <em>Johnson v. State, </em>158 Ga.App. 432, 280 S.E.2d 856, 857 (1981) (holding that the evidence failed to establish \u201cthe present ability to inflict a violent injury\u201d where the evidence proved the accused shook his finger while making a threat at persons in a car).</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">Because Virginia continues to be guided by the common law rule concerning assault, I would hold that the conviction is not supported because the evidence failed to prove Carter acted \u201cby means calculated to produce the end if carried into execution.\u201d <em>Zimmerman, </em>266 Va. at 387, 585 S.E.2d at 539. Accordingly, I would reverse the conviction for assault.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b747-7\">. Consistent with the assault definition in <em>Zimmerman, </em>the full sentence extracted in the <em>Vaughn </em>citation in this quotation is as follows: \"We have held that the intent to put another in fear of bodily harm with a threat to use bodily force, <em>such as brandishing a deadly weapon, </em>is an assault.\u201d 263 Va. at 35, 557 S.E.2d at 222 (emphasis added).
