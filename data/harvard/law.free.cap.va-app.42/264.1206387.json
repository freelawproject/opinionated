ARTHUR KELSEY, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">Dejuan Whitfield-Smith died within a couple of hours after his birth. His estate filed a malpractice action in Richmond Circuit Court against Chippenham &amp; Johnston-Willis Hospital, Inc., Central Virginia Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology Associates, P.C., and Kwasi A. Debra, M.D. In defense of this claim, the defendants asserted statutory tort immunity under the Virginia Birth-Related Neurological Injury Compensation Act, Code \u00a7\u00a7 38.2-5000 to 38.2-5021. As the Act requires, the circuit court referred the question to the Virginia Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission. After hearing conflicting medical evidence, the commission held that the Act did not apply to Dejuan\u2019s injury and thus did not afford statutory immunity to the tort defendants. The defendants, appellants in this consolidated appeal, seek our review of the commission\u2019s decision. They contend that the commission misapplied the burden of proof and made insupportable factual findings. Disagreeing with both contentions, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">On appeal, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party before the commission. <em>Clinchfield Coal Co. v. Reed, </em>40 Va.App. 69, 72, 577 S.E.2d 538, 539 (2003); <em>Tomes v. James City (County Of) Fire, </em>39 Va.App. 424, 429, 573 S.E.2d 312, 315 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">Lawanda Whitfield gave birth to an infant son, Dejuan Whitfield-Smith, at Chippenham Medical Center on December 30, 1998. Dr. Kwasi Debra, an obstetrician, used forceps extraction during the delivery. When Dejuan emerged from the birth canal, his nuchal cord was wrapped tightly around his neck.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-9\">After being cut free, Dejuan remained in severe respiratory distress. His Apgar scores were 1 at one minute, 0 at five <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>minutes, and 0 at ten minutes.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Dr. Debra pronounced Dejuan dead in the delivery room and handed him over to his mother. Dejuan\u2019s mother noticed, however, that he appeared to be gasping for breath. A nurse also noted that Dejuan was moving his arms and legs. She took the child\u2019s pulse and discovered he had a heart rate in the 150s. An intensive care team took Dejuan to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. Dejuan\u2019s condition quickly deteriorated. He was, again, pronounced dead about two hours later.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">Dr. Fabio Gutierrez performed an autopsy and concluded that the cause of Dejuan\u2019s death was cardiopulmonary arrest secondary to birth asphyxia as a result of being choked by his umbilical cord during labor and delivery. Dejuan\u2019s mother, as administratrix of her son\u2019s estate, filed a wrongful death action in circuit court against Dr. Debra, her medical practice, and the hospital. Asserting that Dejuan\u2019s injury fell within the scope of the Virginia Birth-Related Neurological Injury Compensation Act, the defendants sought the statutory tort immunity afforded under the Act. Pursuant to Code \u00a7 8.01-273.1, the trial court referred the question to the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">Before the commission, the parties submitted conflicting medical evidence on the newborn\u2019s precise condition prior to his death. This evidence, the defendants argued, triggered a statutory presumption that the Act governed Dejuan\u2019s injury. The commission disagreed, finding the evidence insufficient to invoke the presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">Dr. Debra, her medical practice, and the hospital appeal the commission\u2019s ruling to us claiming (a) the commission failed to properly apply the Act\u2019s statutory presumption and thereby misallocated the burden of proof, and (b) had the presumption been applied properly, it would have established the Act\u2019s coverage. After reviewing the history and purposes of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>Act, we will address each of the appellants\u2019 arguments in turn. In our judgment, neither has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">One of only two such statutes in the nation, the Virginia Birth-Related Neurological Compensation Act provides claimants with a no-fault remedy for compensation for qualified injuries. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 38.2-5009.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Act also affords potential tort defendants (at least those who contribute voluntary assessments to the fund under Code \u00a7 38.2-5015), with an absolute immunity to civil malpractice liability for these injuries. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 38.2-5002(B). \u201cThe Act generally provides the sole remedy for infants who have incurred a birth-related neurological injury caused by a \u2018participating physician\u2019 or a \u2018participating hospital,\u2019 and bars infants who have sustained injuries of this nature from maintaining a common law tort action against such a \u2018participating physician\u2019 or \u2018participating hospital.\u2019 \u201d <em>Berner v. Mills, </em>265 Va. 408, 411, 579 S.E.2d 159, 160 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">This finely engineered <em>quid pro quo, </em>however, does not uniformly favor claimants or potential tort defendants. In cases where malpractice litigation appears ill advised, a claimant may seek the application of the Act to his claim to obtain benefits from the statutory compensation fund. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 38.2-5009, 38.2-5015(A). But in cases where litigation may be more promising, a claimant may seek to <em>defeat </em>the application of the Act to his claim. Each of our cases discussing the Act involves instances where claimants sought the application of the Act to their claims and were willing to stipulate the resulting tort immunity afforded to potential malpractice defendants.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The case before us now, however, involves one of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>the second type: a situation where the tort defendants in a pending malpractice lawsuit seek the application of the Act to the claim over the objection of the claimant.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">For the Act to apply, the infant must have suffered a \u201cbirth-related neurological injury.\u201d <em>See Coffey v. Va. Birth-Related Neuro. Injury Comp. Pgm., </em>37 Va.App. 390, 399-400, 558 S.E.2d 563, 568 (2002). Under Code \u00a7 38.2-5001, four things must be true for an injury to fit this definition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-5\">(1) The infant sustained \u201can injury to the brain or spinal cord\u201d that was \u201ccaused by deprivation of oxygen or mechanical injury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-6\">(2) The injury occurred \u201cin the course of labor, delivery or resuscitation necessitated by a deprivation of oxygen or mechanical injury that occurred in the course of labor or delivery, in a hospital.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-7\">(3) The injury rendered the infant \u201cpermanently motorically disabled and (i) developmentally disabled or (ii) for infants sufficiently developed to be cognitively evaluated, cognitively disabled.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-8\">(4) Such disability caused \u201cthe infant to be permanently in need of assistance in all activities of daily living.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>If the party seeking the Act\u2019s application proves that the injury falls within this definition, the Act applies. The result is the potential availability of compensation to the claimants under Code \u00a7 38.2-5009 and the certain availability of tort immunity for any potential tort defendants under Code \u00a7 38.2-5002(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">Under the Act, a rebuttable presumption of a birth-related neurological injury exists when the proponent of the Act\u2019s coverage proves elements one and three of the \u00a7 38.2-5001 definition. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 38.2-5008(A)(1)(a). When these two predicate facts are proved, the factfinder may presume that elements two and four of the statutory definition are also met.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Once the presumption applies, the burden of proof shifts to the party opposing the presumption to disprove elements two and four, and thereby establish \u201cthat the injuries alleged are not birth-related neurological injuries within the meaning of the chapter.\u201d <em>Wolfe v. Va. Birth-Related Neuro. Injury Comp. Pgm., </em>40 Va.App. 565, 578, 580 S.E.2d 467, 474 (2003) (quoting Code \u00a7 38.2-5008(A)(1)(a)).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b324-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>A.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">In this case, the parties agree that Dejuan suffered \u201can injury to the brain or spinal cord\u201d caused by the \u201cdeprivation of oxygen or mechanical injury\u201d \u2014 element one of the statutory definition and the first predicate fact necessary for the presumption. They also agree that Dejuan\u2019s injury occurred \u201cin the course of labor, delivery or resuscitation necessitated by a deprivation of oxygen or mechanical injury that occurred in the course of labor or delivery, in a hospital\u201d \u2014 element two of the definition and a fact that may be inferred if the presumption applies. The parties dispute whether Dejuan\u2019s injury caused him to be \u201cpermanently in need of assistance in all activities of daily living,\u201d but admit that this fact may be inferred if the statutory presumption applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">The dispositive issue thus centers on whether appellants established that Dejuan, prior to his death, was permanently \u201cmotorically disabled\u201d and \u201cdevelopmentally\u201d or \u201ccognitively\u201d disabled \u2014 the second predicate fact necessary for the \u00a7 38.2-5008(A)(l)(a) presumption to apply. To resolve this dispute, we must first address appellants\u2019 argument that a predicate fact can be established merely by \u201cthe submission of any credible evidence.\u201d Under this view, the presentation of any plausible evidence (regardless of whether it is in fact believed) triggers the presumption and shifts the burden of persuasion to the other side to rebut it. After all, appellants correctly point out, we have described the burden as merely \u201ca <em>prima facie </em>\u201d showing, <em>Coffey, </em>37 Va.App. at 401, 558 S.E.2d at 569, which literally means \u201cat first sight\u201d or \u201con first appearance,\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1209 (7th ed. 1999). That <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>description, as a general rule, does not connote anything more than a mere evidentiary sufficiency. <em>See, e.g., Virginia v. Black, </em>538 U.S. 343, 123 S.Ct. 1536, 1554, 155 L.Ed.2d 535 (2003) (Scalia, J., concurring in part) (\u201c <em>\u2018Prima facie </em>evidence of a fact is such evidence as, in judgment of law, is sufficient to establish the fact; and, if not rebutted, remains sufficient for the purpose.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting 7B <em>Michie\u2019s Jurisprudence of Virginia and West Virginia </em>\u00a7 32 (1998)). <em>\u201cPrima facie </em>evidence is evidence which on its first appearance is sufficient to raise a presumption of fact or establish the fact in question unless rebutted.\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Dalton, </em>11 Va.App. 620, 623, 400 S.E.2d 801, 803 (1991) (quoting <em>Babbitt v. Miller, </em>192 Va. 372, 379-80, 64 S.E.2d 718, 722 (1951)).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">Even so, the expression <em>\u201cprima facie </em>showing,\u201d <em>Coffey, </em>37 Va.App. at 401, 558 S.E.2d at 569, need not necessarily be understood to describe a mere hypothetical sufficiency of the evidence. Though uncommon, this expression has been used alongside an actual preponderance standard for purposes of triggering a presumption. In Title VII cases, for example, the United States Supreme Court describes the role of a <em>\u201cprima facie </em>case\u201d in just this way:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-5\">The burden of establishing a <em>prima facie </em>case of disparate treatment is not onerous. <em>The plaintiff must prove by a preponderance of the evidence </em>that she applied for an available position for which she was qualified, but was rejected [all predicate facts] under the circumstances which give rise to an inference of unlawful discrimination [the presumed fact].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b325-6\"><em>Texas Dept. of Cmty. Affairs v. Burdine, </em>450 U.S. 248, 253, 101 S.Ct. 1089, 1094, 67 L.Ed.2d 207 (1981) (emphasis added); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number><em>see also McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 802, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 1824, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973) (holding that claimant triggers the presumption by carrying \u201cthe initial burden under the statute of establishing a <em>prima facie </em>case of racial discrimination\u201d); <em>cf. Wolfe, </em>40 Va.App. at 580, 580 S.E.2d at 474 (accepting, without discussion, that a \u201cpreponderance of the evidence\u201d standard applies to the \u00a7 38.2-5008(A)(1) presumption). This description of a <em>prima facie </em>case requires the factfinder to subjectively believe the evidence preponderates in the claimant\u2019s favor, not merely to conclude that an objective, rational factfinder could so find.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">The subtle distinction between these two competing views of a <em>prima facie </em>case, while seeming semantic, understates its potentially outcome-determinative impact. This is particularly true in cases where, as here, the dispute involves not so much a contest between two contradictory sets of facts, but rather a scramble over how to interpret the paucity of facts favoring either side. In such cases, the party with the ultimate burden of proof must demonstrate not only that his view of the evidence should be adopted with confidence, but also that any view of such sketchy evidence could be confidently adopted.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">We do not answer appellants\u2019 argument, however, by weighing the competing policy considerations underlying the assignment of the shifting burdens of proof to determine which would best fit this case. Our task is considerably more simple. \u201cWe begin, as always, with the language of the statute.\u201d <em>Duncan v. Walker, </em>533 U.S. 167, 172, 121 S.Ct. 2120, 2124, 150 L.Ed.2d 251 (2001). And we strive to give that language a \u201cliteral construction\u201d unless doing so \u201cwould involve a manifest absurdity.\u201d <em>Chase v. DaimlerChrysler Corp., </em>266 Va. 544, 547, 587 S.E.2d 521, 522 (2003) (citations omitted); <em>see also Mouberry v. Commonwealth, </em>39 Va.App. 576, 583, 575 S.E.2d 567, 570 (2003) (recognizing that statutory words should be given \u201ctheir common, ordinary and accepted meaning\u201d). This textualist approach presumes that the legislature \u201c \u2018chose, with care,\u2019 the specific words of the statute.\u201d <em>Kane v. Szymczak, </em>41 Va.App. 365, 371, 585 S.E.2d 349, 352-53 (2003) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>In this case, the Virginia Birth-Related Neurological Injury Compensation Act states that the presumption arises when the predicate facts have been \u201cdemonstrated, to the <em>satisfaction </em>of the Virginia Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission.\u201d Code \u00a7 38.2-5008(A)(l)(a) (emphasis added). To demonstrate a fact to the satisfaction of the factfinder means to <em>persuade </em>the actual factfinder, not merely to demonstrate the plausibility of the proffered fact to a sufficient degree that any rational factfinder <em>could be persuaded. </em>Relying on this statutory text, we reject appellants\u2019 argument that \u201cthe submission of any credible evidence\u201d triggers the presumption. Instead, we hold that the party asserting the presumption must demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that the predicate facts are true. Only then does the presumption arise and the burden of proof shift to the party opposing the presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">We next address appellants\u2019 assertion that the commission erred in holding that they did not prove by a preponderance that Dejuan was permanently \u201cmotorically disabled\u201d and \u201cdevelopmentally\u201d or \u201ccognitively\u201d disabled, the second predicate fact necessary to give rise to the \u00a7 38.2-5008(A)(1)(a) presumption. For the following reasons, we conclude that the commission acted within the scope of its decisionmaking discretion as factfinder.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">Appellants produced the expert opinions of Dr. Edward Karotkin and Dr. Warren Broocker. In a letter opinion, Dr. Karotkin concluded that \u201c[e]ven if the child' had responded to the resuscitative efforts, due to the profound oxygen deprivation to his brain, he would have been rendered permanently motorically disabled, developmentally disabled, and cognitively disabled.\u201d Testifying before the deputy commissioner, Dr. Broocker stated that \u201cusually when the asphyxia is severe enough to cause Apgar scores\u201d as low as Dejuan\u2019s, \u201cthe long-term neurologic condition of the baby will be affected. To what degree it will be affected varies from individual to individual, but it will be affected.\u201d Dr. Broocker admitted some doubt, however, as to the accuracy of Apgar scores in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>predicting future neurological deficits. These scores have been used \u201cpretty glibly over the years as medical fact,\u201d Dr. Broocker observed, and \u201cthere are some problems with the Apgar scores actually really predicting as far as how well the baby will do neurologically later on.\u201d He also noted that \u201ceverybody\u2019s got an anecdotal case of an extremely poor Apgar score and the baby did well subsequently .... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">Dejuan\u2019s estate filed the report of Dr. David Axelrod who stated that, given the paucity of medical evidence available to make such a judgment, he did not \u201cbelieve that anyone\u201d could make the determination whether Dejuan \u201cwould have been permanently motorically disabled and developmentally disabled had he survived.\u201d Based upon his review of the child\u2019s autopsy, \u201cwhich showed no pathological damage to the brain such as bleeding, or signs of necrosis,\u201d there was \u201cno evidence that this baby would have been permanently motorically disabled and developmentally disabled if he had survived.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">The commission, pursuant to Code \u00a7 38.2-5008(C), solicited a report from a panel of three impartial physicians. In a letter dated November 29, 2001, Dr. William N.P. Herbert, Dr. James E. Ferguson, II, and Dr. Barbara Head stated: \u201cGiven the fact that this infant expired approximately 2 1/2 hours following delivery, we are unable to determine that the infant was developmentally or cognitively disabled, nor can we state that the infant would be permanently in need of assistance in all activities of daily living.\u201d As a result, they concluded, \u201cthe evidence in this case does not meet the criteria\u201d for a birth-related neurological injury under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">Faced with this evidence, the commission found that appellants failed to prove Dejuan was permanently motorically disabled and developmentally or cognitively disabled. The commission rejected Dr. Karotkin\u2019s opinion because there was \u201cno evidence to quantify the amount of oxygen deprivation suffered by the infant ..., no damage to the brain, such as intracranial bleeding or any other pathology\u201d in the autopsy report and \u201cno blood from the cord was obtained for testing.\u201d Equally unconvincing to the commission was Dr. Broocker\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>opinion, which \u201coffered no opinion as to whether the infant would have been developmentally disabled.\u201d Finding more persuasive the opinions of Dr. Axelrod and the three independent panel physicians, the commission held that appellants failed to prove that Dejuan was permanently \u201cmotorically disabled\u201d and \u201cdevelopmentally\u201d or \u201ccognitively\u201d disabled. Appellants, therefore, failed to trigger the presumption and thereby shift the ultimate burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\">We are in no position to disagree. Of the six physicians that reviewed the file, four stated that they could not \u201cdetermine that the infant was developmentally or cognitively disabled\u201d at the time of his death. Three of these four physicians were independent experts appointed by the commission. Only one physician stated unequivocally that Dejuan was permanently motorically disabled and developmentally or cognitively disabled \u2014 and the commission found this opinion unpersuasive given the lack of any reliable diagnostic evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">\u201cQuestions raised by conflicting medical opinions must be decided by the commission.\u201d <em>Wolfe, </em>40 Va.App. at 580, 580 S.E.2d at 474; <em>Kidder v. Va. Birth-Related Neuro. Injury Comp. Pgm., </em>37 Va.App. 764, 778, 560 S.E.2d 907, 913 (2002); <em>Va. Birth-Related Neuro. Injury Comp. Pgm. v. Young, </em>34 Va.App. 306, 318, 541 S.E.2d 298, 304 (2001). This appellate deference is not a mere legal custom, subject to a flexible application, but a statutory command making clear that the commission\u2019s decision \u201cshall be conclusive and binding as to all questions of fact.\u201d Code \u00a7 38.2-5011(A). Medical evidence, therefore, remains \u201csubject to the commission\u2019s consideration and weighing.\u201d <em>Wolfe, </em>40 Va.App. at 580, 580 S.E.2d at 474 (quoting <em>Young, </em>34 Va.App. at 318, 541 S.E.2d at 304) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). And the appearance of \u201ccontrary evidence in the record is of no consequence if there is credible evidence to support the commission\u2019s finding.\u201d <em>Id.; see also Kidder, </em>37 Va.App. at 778, 560 S.E.2d at 913.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">Despite this deference, appellants argue, the commission\u2019s findings cannot be sustained because Dejuan\u2019s death, by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>itself, overcomes any evidentiary weaknesses in their case. Under this theory, \u201cthe death of an infant from a birth-related oxygen deprivation injury automatically qualifies the infant under the Act.\u201d We find this view flawed for two reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">First, it is a <em>non sequitur </em>to assert that a disability \u2014 as that term is specifically defined and qualified in the statute\u2014 always precedes death or is subsumed by it. While an injury may be an anatomical antecedent to death, the same cannot be said of a statutory disability. It may or may not, depending on the facts. A <em>per se </em>rule equating death with disability mixes unrelated concepts because, as the commission correctly put it, \u201cDeath is the cessation of life, not a measure of disability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">Second, the Act is a comprehensive legislative enactment. It includes multiple provisions defining its terms, describing its scope, and qualifying its reach. Despite this elaborate statutory scheme, not a word expressly says (or, for that matter, reasonably implies) that death should automatically be equated with the highly specific definitional criteria used to determine the Act\u2019s coverage. The omission of any statutory language treating death as a <em>per se </em>event covered by the Act, even if problematic as a policy matter, cannot be remedied by the courts.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> \u201cThe act of choosing carefully some words necessarily implies others are omitted with equal care.\u201d <em>Kane, </em>41 Va.App. at 372, 585 S.E.2d at 353. \u201cAny such change to the statute must be a legislative, rather than a judicial, undertaking.\u201d <em>Mouberry, </em>39 Va.App. at 584-85, 575 S.E.2d at 571.

In order to constitute a \"birth-related neurological injury\u201d within the meaning of this chapter, such disability shall cause the infant to be permanently in need of assistance in all activities of daily living. This definition shall apply to live births only and shall not include disability or death caused by genetic or congenital abnormality, degenerative neurologi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>cal disease, or maternal substance abuse. The definition provided here shall apply retroactively to any child bom on and after January 1, 1988, who suffers from an injury to the brain or spinal cord caused by the deprivation of oxygen or mechanical injury occurring in the course of labor, delivery or resuscitation in the immediate postdelivery period in a hospital.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b323-6\">.

Whether the injury claimed is a birth-related neurological injury as defined in \u00a7 38.2-5001.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-9\">a. A rebuttable presumption shall arise that the injury alleged is a birth-related neurological injury where it has been demonstrated, to the satisfaction of the Virginia Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission, that the infant has sustained a brain or spinal cord injury caused by oxygen deprivation or mechanical injury, and that the infant was thereby rendered permanently motorically disabled and (i) developmentally disabled or (ii) for infants sufficiently developed to be cognitively evaluated, cognitively disabled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-10\">If either party disagrees with such presumption, that party shall have the burden of proving that the injuries alleged are not birth-related neurological injuries within the meaning of the chapter.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b323-11\">. Because of the \"difficulty in proving when such an injury was sustained\u201d and the equally difficult task of proving, prospectively, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>the infant will permanently need assistance in all activities of daily living, \"the legislature enacted a presumption to assist potential claimants in obtaining benefits.\u201d <em>Coffey, </em>37 Va.App. at 400, 558 S.E.2d at 568. Despite <em>Coffey\u2019s </em>contextualization of the issue, however, the presumption also applies in cases where the claimant is not seeking assistance in obtaining statutory benefits, but rather is seeking to defeat the application of the Act and its resulting tort immunity. In such circumstances, the medical providers who seek the Act\u2019s application to the claimant's injury bear the burden of proof.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b325-7\">. When a trial judge in a civil jury case, for example, entertains a motion to strike alleging that the plaintiff has not made out a <em>prima facie </em>case, the judge does not ask whether he personally believes that the evidence rises to a preponderance \u2014 rather, he asks whether the conclusion the plaintiff draws from the evidence would so \u201cdefy logic and common sense\u201d that no rational factfinder could adopt it. <em>Upper Occoquan Sewage Auth. v.

Its opinion in this case concludes: \"There is no presumption of disability in those cases where the infant dies shortly after birth.
