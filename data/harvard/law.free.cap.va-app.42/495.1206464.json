ARTHUR KELSEY, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b552-13\">The trial court convicted Sharon Boyd, an erotic dancer, of violating Henrico County\u2019s public nudity ordinance. The two owners of the strip club, Dianna Lee White and Donna Jean White, were convicted of aiding and abetting Boyd\u2019s violation. They now appeal, claiming their misdemeanor convictions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>should be overturned on various theories. A divided panel of our Court vacated all three convictions. <em>Boyd v. County of Henrico, </em>41 Va.App. 1, 581 S.E.2d 863 (2003). Having reconsidered the matter <em>en banc, </em>we reject appellants\u2019 challenge to the public nudity ordinance and affirm their convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">Henrico enacted its public nudity ordinance in 1982. Its text tracks the language of similar public nudity ordinances adopted across the Commonwealth.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Henrico County Board of Supervisors explained its legislative intent in enacting the ordinance this way:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-7\">The purpose of this ordinance is to make unlawful displays of public nudity in the County, which are deemed offensive to public morality and injurious to the health, safety and general welfare of County citizens, regardless of whether such nudity would or would not in any specific instance be deemed obscene. The ordinance contains exceptions for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>exhibitions and other performances in institutions or establishments, such as theaters and concert halls, primarily devoted to expressions of opinion, communication, speech, ideas, information, art or drama. The ordinance is based on similar legislation enacted in York County and the City of Virginia Beach,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to mention two examples.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">Since 1982, thirty-eight individuals had been prosecuted under the public nudity ban. This one case involves the only application of the ordinance against erotic dancers.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">On July 6, 2001, officers from the Henrico County Police Department went to a newly opened erotic club named Gold City Showgirls. While there, the officers observed ten female dancers strip down to \u201cpasties\u201d and \u201cG-strings\u201d in exchange for tips. The officers issued summonses to the ten dancers they observed, including Boyd, for violating the public nudity ordinance and to a club manager, Donna White, for aiding and abetting the violations.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On July 8, 2001, the officers returned and observed the same type of semi-nude dancing. The officers issued a summons to Dianna White, the manager on duty, and a second summons to Boyd.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">After being found guilty in general district court, appellants appealed to circuit court. In the meantime, the owners of Gold City and two erotic dancers filed a civil action in United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia asserting that the ordinance should be declared unconstitutional and the state prosecution enjoined. The federal district court abstained from ruling on this issue. <em>Colonial </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number><em>First Props., LLC v. Henrico County Virginia, </em>166 F.Supp.2d 1070 (E.D.Va.2001). The state circuit court ease went to trial in late 2001. The parties to the criminal case agreed that depositions taken in the federal case could be submitted <em>de bene esse </em>to the state court. The parties, however, did not agree to submit to the state trial court the transcript of the federal court proceeding. Nor did they stipulate to any factual findings made by the federal district court during the abstention hearing.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">The trial court rejected appellants\u2019 constitutional challenges and heard the cases on the merits. At trial, appellants admitted the dancers wore \u201cpasties\u201d and \u201cG-strings\u201d on July 6 and July 8, 2001. The dancers conceded that their state of undress violated the public nudity ordinance, but instead claimed that their striptease act fell within the exemption in the ordinance for the performance of \u201cany play, ballet, drama, tableau, production or motion picture\u201d in a theater, concert hall, or the like. Henrico County Code \u00a7 13 \u2014 107(c).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> After hearing testimony from eight dancers and the two owners of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>Gold City, the trial court found as a fact that Gold City was not a \u201ctheater\u201d under the ordinance and the dancers were not engaged in any \u201ctheatrical performance either.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">Appellants challenge the public nudity ordinance on various grounds. They contend that (a) the public nudity ordinance infringes on their First Amendment right to erotic dancing; (b) the ordinance should be declared void for vagueness; (c) the County violated equal protection principles by selectively enforcing the ordinance against them; (d) the County has no delegable authority from the General Assembly to enact this ordinance; and (e) the evidence proves their entitlement to the theater exemption to the ordinance.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">We begin our analysis with basic principles of judicial review. All legislative acts are \u201cpresumed to be constitutional.\u201d <em>In re Phillips, </em>265 Va. 81, 85, 574 S.E.2d 270, 272 (2003); <em>see also Bosang v. Iron Belt Bldg. &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n, </em>96 Va. 119, 123, 30 S.E. 440, 441 (1898); <em>Johnson v. Commonwealth, </em>40 Va.App. 605, 612, 580 S.E.2d 486, 490 (2003) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>(recognizing that every legislative act \u201cis presumed to be constitutional, and the Constitution is to be given a liberal construction so as to sustain the enactment in question, if practicable\u201d). This presumption is \u201cone of the strongest known to the law.\u201d <em>Harrison v. Day, </em>200 Va. 764, 770, 107 S.E.2d 594, 598 (1959). Under it, courts must \u201cresolve any reasonable doubt\u201d regarding the constitutionality of a law in favor of its validity. <em>In re Phillips, </em>265 Va. at 85, 574 S.E.2d at 272; <em>see also Wayside Rest., Inc. v. Virginia Beach, </em>215 Va. 231, 236, 208 S.E.2d 51, 55 (1974) (holding public nudity ordinance constitutional). \u201cTo doubt is to affirm.\u201d <em>Peery v. Bd. of Funeral Dirs., </em>203 Va. 161, 165, 123 S.E.2d 94, 97 (1961) (quoting <em>City of Roanoke v. Elliott, </em>123 Va. 393, 406, 96 S.E. 819, 824 (1918)).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">A. <em>The Public Nudity Ordinance Does Not Violate The First Amendment.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">Statutes prohibiting public nudity are of \u201cancient origin\u201d and \u201creflect moral disapproval of people appearing in the nude among strangers in public places.\u201d <em>Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., </em>501 U.S. 560, 568, 111 S.Ct. 2456, 2461, 115 L.Ed.2d 504 (1991) (plurality). For this reason, it has been the traditional view that whatever natural law construct exists to support the \u201cright to appear <em>au naturel </em>at home,\u201d that right is \u201crelinquished when one sets foot\u201d outside. <em>Richards v. Thurston, </em>424 F.2d 1281, 1285 (1st Cir.1970).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Even so, in the \u201couter ambit\u201d of constitutional theory, the erotic speech component of a particular form of public nakedness \u2014 nude dancing at strip <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>clubs \u2014 receives \u201csome measure\u201d of First Amendment protection. <em>Erie v. Pap\u2019s A.M., </em>529 U.S. 277, 289, 120 S.Ct. 1382, 1391, 146 L.Ed.2d 265 (2000) (plurality); <em>see also Barnes, </em>501 U.S. at 566, 111 S.Ct. at 2460. The right, however, is hardly a robust one. At best, it receives a \u201cdiminished form of protection under the First Amendment,\u201d <em>Ben\u2019s Bar, Inc. v. Village of Somerset, </em>316 F.3d 702, 707 (7th Cir.2003), because it involves the \u201cbarest minimum of protected expression,\u201d <em>Barnes, </em>501 U.S. at 565, 111 S.Ct. at 2460 (quoting <em>Doran v. Salem Inn, Inc., </em>422 U.S. 922, 932, 95 S.Ct. 2561, 2568, 45 L.Ed.2d 648 (1975)). Put another way, the right is only \u201cmarginally\u201d within the \u201couter perimeters\u201d of the First Amendment. <em>Barnes, </em>501 U.S. at 566, 111 S.Ct. at 2460.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">Appellants claim the Henrico public nudity ordinance violates the marginal free speech rights inherent in erotic dancing. They rest this claim on two assertions. First, appellants contend the ordinance constitutes the most serious of all First Amendment violations: a content-based restriction on free speech.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Second, appellants argue that the public nudity ordinance \u2014 even if not content based \u2014 still works such a hardship on their free speech rights that it must be declared unconstitutional. We reject both arguments, finding they reflect a basic misunderstanding of First Amendment law.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">A law regulating expressive activity should be deemed content neutral \u201cso long as it is <em>\u2018justified, </em>without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>reference to the content of the regulated speech.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ward v. Rock Against Racism, </em>491 U.S. 781, 791, 109 S.Ct. 2746, 2753, 105 L.Ed.2d 661 (1989) (emphasis in original and citation omitted). Because such regulations are \u201cunrelated to [the suppression of] expression,\u201d <em>Lorillard Tobacco Co. v. Reilly, </em>533 U.S. 525, 567, 121 S.Ct. 2404, 2428, 150 L.Ed.2d 532 (2001), they are subjected to a \u201cless-rigorous analysis,\u201d <em>Turner Broad. Sys. v. FCC, </em>520 U.S. 180, 213, 117 S.Ct. 1174, 1198, 137 L.Ed.2d 369 (1997). Sufficient government interests justifying content-neutral regulations include \u201cpreventing harmful secondary effects,\u201d <em>Erie, </em>529 U.S. at 293, 120 S.Ct. at 1393, and \u201cprotecting order and morality,\u201d <em>Barnes, </em>501 U.S. at 569, 111 S.Ct. at 2462, both classic expressions of state police powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-4\">The Henrico public nudity ban regulates conduct \u2014 not the content of anyone\u2019s speech. In this respect, the ordinance is no different from either of the two public nudity laws deemed content neutral in <em>Barnes </em>and <em>Erie. </em>As the United States Supreme Court said in <em>Erie:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-5\">The ordinance here, like the statute in <em>Barnes, </em>is on its face a general prohibition on public nudity. By its terms, the ordinance regulates conduct alone. It does not target nudity that contains an erotic message; rather, it bans all public nudity, regardless of whether that nudity is accompanied by expressive activity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b559-6\"><em>Erie, </em>529 U.S. at 290, 120 S.Ct. at 1391. The same can be said of the Henrico ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">True, some may \u201cview restricting nudity on moral grounds as necessarily related to expression.\u201d <em>Barnes, </em>501 U.S. at 570, 111 S.Ct. at 2462. And, in an abstract sense, it is entirely fair to say that people \u201cwho go about in the nude in public may be expressing something about themselves by so doing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This point, however, proves too much. Taken to its logical limits, it obliterates any First Amendment distinctions between speech and conduct. A flasher in a public mall may genuinely intend to communicate a message \u2014 whether erotic, neurotic, or both. But the communicative element in his conduct should receive no constitutional protection. Despite <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>the libertarian traditions animating the First Amendment, we are not dealing here with protecting the societal value of \u201cuntrammeled political debate\u201d and \u201cfew of us would march our sons and daughters off to war to preserve a citizen\u2019s right\u201d to unlimited expression of public sexuality. <em>Erie, </em>529 U.S. at 294, 120 S.Ct. at 1394 (quoting <em>Young v. Am. Mini Theatres, Inc., </em>427 U.S. 50, 70, 96 S.Ct. 2440, 2452, 49 L.Ed.2d 310 (1976)).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">Appellants take no issue with <em>Erie </em>or <em>Barnes, </em>but instead seek to distinguish them on the ground that the Henrico ordinance contains an exemption for theatrical performances. The public nudity ban in <em>Erie, </em>appellants argue, applied to theaters. From there, appellants reason that the theatrical nudity exemption in the Henrico ordinance transforms an otherwise permissible, content-neutral public nudity ban into a thinly disguised content-based restriction. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">Despite the fact that the public nudity ban in <em>Erie </em>did not include an express exemption, the prosecutor in <em>Erie </em>stipulated that the ban did not apply to theatrical and artistic nudity. Making the same argument as appellants do here, the dissent in <em>Erie </em>seized upon this stipulation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-7\">In an earlier proceeding in this case, the Court of Common Pleas asked Erie\u2019s counsel \u201cwhat effect would this ordinance have on theater ... productions such as Equus, Hair, 0[h!] Caleutta[!]? Under your ordinance would these things be prevented ... ?\u201d Counsel responded: \u201cNo, they wouldn\u2019t, Your Honor.\u201d App. 53. Indeed, as stipulated in the record, the city permitted a production of Equus to proceed without prosecution, even after the ordinance was in effect, and despite its awareness of the nudity involved in the production----As presented to us, the ordinance is deliberately targeted at Kandyland\u2019s type of nude dancing (to the exclusion of plays like Equus), in terms of both its applicable scope and the city\u2019s enforcement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-9\">* * * ifs * <em>*</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-10\">Nor could <em>it be </em>contended that selective applicability by stipulated enforcement should be treated differently from selective applicability by statutory text. <em>See Barnes, </em>501 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>U.S. at 574[, 111 S.Ct. at 2464-65] (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment) (selective enforcement may affect a law\u2019s generality). Were it otherwise, constitutional prohibitions could be circumvented with impunity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b561-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 328 n. 12, 120 S.Ct. at 1412 n. 12 (Stevens, J., dissenting). The plurality in <em>Erie </em>rejected this argument and acknowledged that its own analysis presupposed that the public nudity ban had \u201cthe effect of limiting one particular means of expressing the kind of erotic message being disseminated at Kandyland.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 293, 120 S.Ct. at 1393.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">The same is true of the public nudity ban in <em>Barnes. </em>Notwithstanding the absence of any express exemption, the public nudity ban there had been construed by the state courts to exclude theatrical nudity.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The Supreme Court acknowledged this limiting construction on the ordinance as a legitimate effort by the state courts to \u201csave it from a facial overbreadth attack.\u201d <em>Barnes, </em>501 U.S. at 564 n. 1, 111 S.Ct. at 2459 n. 1. In his concurring opinion, Justice Scalia agreed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aip\">Respondents also contend that the statute, as interpreted, is not content-neutral in the expressive conduct to which it applies, since it allegedly does not apply to nudity in theatrical productions. <em>See State v. Baysinger, </em>272 Ind. 236, 247, 397 N.E.2d 580, 587 (1979). I am not sure that theater versus non-theater represents a distinction based on content, rather than format, but assuming that it does, the argument nonetheless fails for the reason the plurality describes, <em>ante, </em>at 564, n. 1, 111 S.Ct. at 2459 n. 1.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b561-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 574 n. 2, 111 S.Ct. at 2464 n. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">By including an express exemption for theatrical nudity, Henrico merely put in writing what was implicit in both the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number><em>Erie </em>and <em>Barnes </em>public nudity bans. The exemption in the Henrico ordinance does nothing more than ensure that the ordinance incidentally restricts the least amount of expressive conduct, and thus, protects the ordinance against an over-breadth challenge. <em>See, e.g., Giovani Carandola, Ltd. v. Bason, </em>303 F.3d 507, 517-19 (4th Cir.2002) (holding lack of a theater exemption raised overbreadth problems sufficient to warrant a preliminary injunction).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">In addition, the theatrical nudity exemption reflects a legitimate recognition of the unique secondary effects associated with erotic clubs. \u201cEstablishments that purvey erotica, live or pictorial, tend to be tawdry, to be offensive to many people, and to attract a dubious, sometimes a disorderly, clientele.\u201d <em>Blue Canary Corp. v. City of Milwaukee, </em>251 F.3d 1121, 1124 (7th Cir.2001). The impact of erotic dancing and other sexually oriented businesses on the surrounding community is \u201call too real.\u201d <em>Alameda Books, Inc., </em>535 U.S. at 444, 122 S.Ct. at 1739 (Kennedy, J., concurring).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">A public nudity ban should be \u201cproperly evaluated as a content-neutral restriction because the interest in combating the secondary effects associated with those clubs is unrelated to the suppression of the erotic message conveyed by nude dancing.\u201d <em>Erie, </em>529 U.S. at 296, 120 S.Ct. at 1394; <em>see also Clark v. City of Lakewood, </em>259 F.3d 996, 1004 (9th Cir.2001). So, while the messages conveyed by erotic dancing and theatrical nudity may be similar, the social by-products of each medium may be considerably different. <em>See DLS, Inc. v. Chattanooga, </em>107 F.3d 403, 412 n. 9 (6th Cir.1997).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>the \u201climited field of regulations on public exhibitions of adult entertainment,\u201d therefore, the presence of negative secondary effects permits public nudity regulations to be treated \u201cas content-neutral and so subject only to intermediate scrutiny.\u201d <em>Giovani Carandola, Ltd., </em>303 F.3d at 515.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\">All of this leads to the application of the four-part test governing content-neutral restrictions on speech. Under that test, the Henrico ordinance survives scrutiny if it (i) falls within \u201cthe constitutional power\u201d of the county, (ii) furthers an \u201cimportant or substantial government interest,\u201d (iii) furthers that interest in a manner \u201cunrelated to the suppression of free expression,\u201d and (iv) imposes no greater incidental restriction on protected speech \u201cthan is essential to the furtherance of that interest.\u201d <em>Erie, </em>529 U.S. at 296-301, 120 S.Ct. at 1394-97; <em>see also Barnes, </em>501 U.S. at 567, 111 S.Ct. at 2461 (quoting <em>United States v. O'Brien, </em>391 U.S. 367, 376-77, 88 S.Ct. 1673, 1678-79, 20 L.Ed.2d 672 (1968)). Appellants concede the Henrico public nudity ban satisfies prong one. They make no mention of prong two, except to mischaracterize it as requiring a \u201ccompelling\u201d state interest, a requirement reserved only for content-based restrictions. Appellants focus their challenge on prongs three and four.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">On the third prong, appellants argue that the purpose of the ordinance is unrelated to the suppression of free expression, but its application is not. In support, appellants again assert that the theatrical exemption (written into the text of the ordinance) requires law enforcement officials to make content-based distinctions. As noted earlier, however, the same exemption was present in <em>Barnes </em>and <em>Erie. </em>It serves an important limiting function and thereby avoids potential overbreadth problems with the ordinance. <em>See Barnes, </em>501 U.S. at 564 n. 1, 111 S.Ct. at 2459 n. 1. The exemption also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>rests on a valid assessment of the differing secondary effects between the two venues. The focus on secondary effects was at the heart of the <em>Erie </em>holding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-4\">Even if we had not already rejected the view that a ban on public nudity is necessarily related to the suppression of the erotic message of nude dancing, we would do so now because the premise of such a view is flawed. The State\u2019s interest in preventing harmful secondary effects is not related to the suppression of expression.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b564-5\"><em>Erie, </em>529 U.S. at 293, 120 S.Ct. at 1393. The theatrical exemption, therefore, does not violate the third prong of the content-neutral test any more than it did in <em>Barnes </em>or <em>Erie.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AkU\">Appellants also contend that the Henrico ordinance violates the fourth prong. On this issue, appellants claim that the legislative intent of the ordinance was merely \u201cto prevent urinating in public and similar problems.\u201d But, because the literal text of the ordinance also applies to erotic dancing, appellants reason, the ordinance goes further than necessary \u201cto prevent or deter public urination, \u2018mooning\u2019 or skinny dipping.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">We cannot accept this analysis for several reasons. To begin with, the trial court made no factual finding that the purpose of the ordinance was limited to public urination, mooning, and skinny dipping. Appellants\u2019 assertion appears to be taken from a memo from a lieutenant in the county police department to the police chief. The memo mentions the need for an ordinance to outlaw public urination, mooning, and skinny dipping. The same memo, however, also adds that the ordinance should prohibit \u201cgenerally being nude in public.\u201d Appellants\u2019 assertion, therefore, relies on a non-legislative source that, in any event, contemplates a greater scope than merely proscribing mooning, public urination, and skinny dipping.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-8\">The only reliable source for legislative intent in this record can be found in a memo of the Henrico County Board of Supervisors accompanying the proposed ordinance at the time of its enactment. It makes clear that the stated purpose of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>the public nudity ban involves broad concerns over \u201cpublic morality\u201d and the need to regulate conduct that the legislative body deemed \u201cinjurious to the health, safety and general welfare\u201d of the community. It was exactly these concerns over \u201csecondary effects, such as the impacts on public health, safety, and welfare,\u201d <em>Erie </em>explained, \u201cwhich we have previously recognized are \u2018caused by the presence of even one such\u2019 establishment.\u201d <em>Erie, </em>529 U.S. at 291, 120 S.Ct. at 1392 (citation omitted). <em>Barnes </em>likewise found that an identical expression of the \u201ctraditional police power\u201d of a state to \u201cprovide for the public health, safety, and morals\u201d may serve as a permissible legislative goal for the enactment of a public nudity ordinance applicable to erotic dancing. <em>Barnes, </em>501 U.S. at 569, 111 S.Ct. at 2462.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\">Properly applied, the fourth prong of the <em>Erie </em>content-neutral test requires us to consider whether the ordinance imposes too great an incidental burden on speech. Before engaging in this analysis, we must first frame the issue precisely. The only constitutional right here (albeit one \u201cmarginally\u201d within the \u201couter perimeters\u201d of the First Amendment, <em>Barnes, </em>501 U.S. at 566, 111 S.Ct. at 2460) is the erotic message implicit in nude or semi-nude dancing. There is no general right to take one\u2019s clothes off in public. Nor is there a constitutional right to wear pasties and G-strings rather than the lingerie-like tops and bottoms required by the Henrico <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>ordinance. Thus, we cannot ask whether requiring slightly more clothes restricts the erotic dancer\u2019s right to be less clothed. \u201cBeing \u2018in a state of nudity,\u2019 \u201d after all, \u201cis not an inherently expressive condition.\u201d <em>Erie, </em>529 U.S. at 289, 120 S.Ct. at 1391. Instead, we must ask whether the ordinance unduly burdens the dancer\u2019s ability to express her erotic message by requiring her to cover up slightly more of her body with slightly more fabric.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\"><em>Erie </em>held that going from complete nudity to being partly clothed (with pasties and a G-string) involved a <em>de minimis </em>impact on the ability of a dancer to express eroticism. <em>Erie, </em>529 U.S. at 294, 120 S.Ct. at 1393-94. The Henrico ordinance, in contrast, does not involve a transition from totally nude to partly clothed, but rather one from partly clothed to slightly more partly clothed. If going from naked to non-naked involves a constitutionally insignificant difference in degree, then the incrementally more fabric required by the Henrico ordinance can hardly constitute a constitutionally fatal difference. In this respect, the Henrico ordinance involves no more of a burden on the dancer\u2019s free speech than the <em>Erie </em>requirement to wear some form of clothing in the first place. The dancer\u2019s erotic message still reaches its intended audience. The additional clothing just \u201cmakes the message slightly less graphic.\u201d <em>Barnes, </em>501 U.S. at 571, 111 S.Ct. at 2463.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">In other words, the pasties and G-string requirement should be understood as the \u201cbare minimum necessary to achieve the state\u2019s purpose.\u201d <em>Barnes, </em>501 U.S. at 572, 111 S.Ct. at 2463. It necessarily follows that this requirement does not represent \u201cthe maximum requirements of dress that an anti-nudity ordinance may impose.\u201d <em>Caf\u00e9 207 v. St. Johns County, </em>856 F.Supp. 641, 645-46 (M.D.Fla.1994), <em>aff'd, </em>66 F.3d 272 (11th Cir.1995); <em>see also Bright Lights v. City of Newport, </em>830 F.Supp. 378, 383-84 (E.D.Ky.1993). Thus, by going slightly beyond the pasties and G-string requirement, the Henrico public nudity ordinance did not so prejudice the eroticism inherent in the dancer\u2019s expressive conduct as to run afoul of the First Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>Moreover, in determining whether \u201cparticular conduct possesses sufficient communicative elements to bring the First Amendment into play,\u201d we should consider not only the messenger\u2019s intent but also whether \u201cthe likelihood was great that the message would be understood by those who viewed it.\u201d <em>Texas v. Johnson, </em>491 U.S. 397, 404, 109 S.Ct. 2533, 2539, 105 L.Ed.2d 342 (1989) (quoting <em>Spence v. Washington, </em>418 U.S. 405, 410-11, 94 S.Ct. 2727, 2730, 41 L.Ed.2d 842 (1974)). Along these same lines, we do not accept appellants\u2019 unstated assumption that the more graphic the dancer\u2019s display of nudity the more erotic her message necessarily becomes. While that may be true at the extremes (like the contrast between a dancer in a snow skiing suit and one completely naked), it is not true at the margins (like the contrast between a dancer wearing almost nothing and one wearing slightly more than almost nothing).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\">B. <em>The Ordinance Is Not Void For Vagueness.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">An enactment may be found void for vagueness under either of two related theories. <em>See Hill v. Colorado, </em>530 U.S. 703, 732, 120 S.Ct. 2480, 2498, 147 L.Ed.2d 597 (2000). First, if a statute \u201cfails to provide people of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to understand what conduct it prohibits\u201d it may be found vague. <em>Id. </em>Second, an enactment may be found vague if \u201cit authorizes or even encourages arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">Appellants assert both vagueness infirmities with Henrico\u2019s public nudity ordinance. On the first point, appellants contend that Henrico officials never gave appellants any advance warning that their conduct violated the public nudity ordinance. County officials, however, did not have to give the erotic club or any of its dancers specific notice of the ordinance. The mere promulgation of the ordinance was notice to all. <em>See generally Bryan v. United States, </em>524 U.S. 184, 196, 118 S.Ct. 1939, 1947-48, 141 L.Ed.2d 197 (1998) (recognizing the \u201ctraditional rule that ignorance of the law is no excuse\u201d). \u201cThe determination whether a criminal statute provides fair warning of its prohibitions must be made on the basis of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>statute itself and the other pertinent law, rather than on the basis of an <em>ad hoc </em>appraisal of the subjective expectations of particular defendants.\u201d <em>Bouie v. Columbia, </em>378 U.S. 347, 355 n. 5, 84 S.Ct. 1697, 1703 n. 5, 12 L.Ed.2d 894 (1964). Under settled law, therefore, we must apply \u201can objective test for determining whether a statute is vague.\u201d Laurence H. Tribe, <em>Constitutional Law </em>\u00a7 12-31, at 1033 n. 3 (2d ed. 1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">The proper test focuses on whether a reasonable person could have understood what the Henrico public nudity ordinance literally proscribed. <em>See Hill, </em>530 U.S. at 733, 120 S.Ct. at 2498. The Virginia Supreme Court resolved that issue in <em>Wayside Rest., Inc. v. Virginia Beach, </em>215 Va. 231, 236, 208 S.E.2d 51, 55 (1974). There, an erotic club challenged a similar public nudity ordinance on vagueness grounds. The Virginia Supreme Court held that the challenged terms in the ordinance were \u201cin common use\u201d and \u201creadily understood by the average person.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Henrico ordinance uses nearly identical language, having been patterned (the evidence at trial proved) expressly after the Virginia Beach ordinance approved by <em>Wayside Rest., Inc.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">For example, the Henrico ordinance defines a \u201cstate of nudity\u201d in a manner similar to the public nudity ordinance in <em>Wayside Rest., Inc., </em>215 Va. at 232 n. 1, 208 S.E.2d at 52 n. 1. The words used in the definition section of the public nudity ordinance \u2014 \u201cbuttocks,\u201d \u201cfemale breast,\u201d \u201ctop of the nipple\u201d and the like \u2014 are commonly understood terms. <em>Cf. </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-390(2) (using identical language to define nudity). Similarly, the theater exemption in the Henrico ordinance tracks verbatim the exemption in <em>Wayside Rest., Inc., </em>215 Va. at 232 n. 1, 208 S.E.2d at 52 n. 1. Indeed, the Virginia Supreme Court found that the most arguably ambiguous language in the exemption \u2014 the catch-all phrase \u201cother similar establishment\u201d following the list of artistic venues like plays, dramas, and theaters \u2014 was not unconstitutionally vague. <em>Id. </em>at 236, 208 S.E.2d at 55; <em>see also Bomhower v. Virginia Beach, </em>76 F.Supp.2d 681, 686 (E.D.Va.1999) (rejecting similar vagueness challenge to a public nudity ordinance).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>In addition, a specific \u201cscienter requirement\u201d in an ordinance (requiring that criminal culpability be grounded on knowing violations of law) further protects a law from a vagueness challenge. <em>Hill, </em>530 U.S. at 732, 120 S.Ct. at 2498. A scienter requirement \u201cmay mitigate a law\u2019s vagueness, especially with respect to the adequacy of notice to the complainant that his conduct is proscribed.\u201d <em>Hoffman Estates v. Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc., </em>455 U.S. 489, 499,102 S.Ct. 1186, 1193, 71 L.Ed.2d 362 (1982). The Henrico ordinance contains a specific scienter requirement that the accused must \u201cknowingly, voluntarily and intentionally\u201d be in public in a \u201cstate of nudity.\u201d Henrico County Code \u00a7 13-107(b). This scienter requirement, built into the text of the ordinance, further undermines appellants\u2019 claim of inadequate notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\">We also disagree with appellants\u2019 argument that the vagueness test should turn on whether the Henrico ordinance applies to \u201ctechnical\u201d violators like women wearing \u201ccontemporary swimwear\u201d or \u201cshort-shorts,\u201d or mothers engaged in breast feeding. As the United States Supreme Court recently emphasized, \u201cspeculation about possible vagueness in hypothetical situations not before the Court\u201d should be given no weight in the analysis. <em>Hill, </em>530 U.S. at 733, 120 S.Ct. at 2498 (citing <em>United States v. Raines, </em>362 U.S. 17, 23, 80 S.Ct. 519, 523-24, 4 L.Ed.2d 524 (1960)). \u201cThere is little doubt that imagination can conjure up hypothetical cases in which the meaning of these terms will be in nice question,\u201d <em>id. </em>(quoting <em>Am. Communications Ass\u2019n. v. Douds, </em>339 U.S. 382, 412, 70 S.Ct. 674, 691, 94 L.Ed. 925 (1950)), but the focus must remain on the facts before the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">As a result, one \u201cwho engages in some conduct that is clearly proscribed cannot complain of the vagueness of the law as applied to the conduct of others.\u201d <em>Hoffman Estates, </em>455 U.S. at 495, 102 S.Ct. at 1191; <em>see also Parker v. Levy, </em>417 U.S. 733, 756, 94 S.Ct. 2547, 2561-62, 41 L.Ed.2d 439 (1974) (\u201cOne to whose conduct a statute clearly applies may not successfully challenge it for vagueness.\u201d); <em>Bomhower, </em>76 F.Supp.2d at 686 (holding that an erotic club, against which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>the public nudity ordinance clearly applied, could not assert vagueness claim on behalf of others). The erotic dancers in this case stripped down to pasties and G-strings. They were not wearing \u201ccontemporary swimwear\u201d or \u201cshort-shorts.\u201d Nor were they breast feeding on stage. Because the very \u201cnature of judicial review constrains us to consider the case that is actually before us,\u201d <em>McConnell v. FEC, </em>540 U.S. \u2014, 124 S.Ct. 619, 688, 157 L.Ed.2d 491, 2003 U.S. Lexis 9195, at *179 (2003) (citation omitted), we decline appellants\u2019 invitation to offer an advisory opinion on such \u201chypothetical situations,\u201d <em>Hill, </em>530 U.S. at 733, 120 S.Ct. at 2498 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">We likewise disagree that the ordinance violated the vagueness test on the ground that \u201cit authorizes or even encourages arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.\u201d <em>Hill, </em>530 U.S. at 732, 120 S.Ct. at 2498. Because law enforcement always \u201crequires the exercise of some decree of police judgment,\u201d <em>Grayned v. City of Rockford, </em>408 U.S. 104, 114, 92 S.Ct. 2294, 2302, 33 L.Ed.2d 222 (1972), a law should not be invalidated unless its clarity has been \u201cdesignedly avoided so as to allow the net to be cast at large,\u201d <em>Papachristou v. City of Jacksonville, </em>405 U.S. 156, 166, 92 S.Ct. 839, 845, 31 L.Ed.2d 110 (1972) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">On this issue, we see no persuasive point to be made over the fact that a police officer must see a particular item of clothing to determine whether to issue a summons. It is entirely appropriate for an officer to examine the conduct in question and make a judgment as to whether, under the probable cause standard, the conduct is illegal.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The vague<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>ness test does not forbid individualized assessments by law enforcement officers. What it forbids is a law that, by its expansive sweep of language, enacts an elastic definition of illegality \u2014 one that authorizes an officer to define for himself what is and is not legal. Nothing in the Henrico ordinance goes that far.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">C. <em>The County Did Not Engage In Unlawful Selective Prosecution.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">Even if the public nudity ordinance survives the vagueness test, appellants argue, the County still violated equal protection principles by singling them out for selective prosecution. This assertion rests primarily on the prosecutor\u2019s concession that he would not prosecute \u201ctechnical\u201d violations of the ordinance which would include some forms of skimpy swimwear at public pools, nursing mothers in public, and the like. We reject this claim for three reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">First, the structure of tripartite government creates a judicial presumption in favor of \u201cbroad\u201d prosecutorial discretion. <em>See United States v. Armstrong, </em>517 U.S. 456, 464-65, 116 S.Ct. 1480, 1486-87, 134 L.Ed.2d 687 (1996). \u201cThis broad discretion rests largely on the recognition that the decision to prosecute is particularly ill-suited to judicial review.\u201d <em>Wayte v. United States, </em>470 U.S. 598, 607, 105 S.Ct. 1524, 1530, 84 L.Ed.2d 547 (1985). \u201cEven in the criminal-law field, a selective prosecution claim is a <em>rara avis.\u201d Reno v. Am.-Arab Anti-Discrimination Comm., </em>525 U.S. 471, 489, 119 S.Ct. 936, 946, 142 L.Ed.2d 940 (1999). Thus, \u201c[i]n the ordinary case, \u2018so long as the prosecutor has probable cause to believe that the accused committed an offense defined by statute, the decision whether or not to prosecute ... generally rests entirely in his discretion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Armstrong, </em>517 U.S. at 464, 116 S.Ct. at 1486 (quoting <em>Bordenkircher v. Hayes, </em>434 U.S. 357, 364, 98 S.Ct. 663, 668, 54 L.Ed.2d 604 (1978)).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>\u201cTo succeed on a selective-prosecution claim, a defendant must demonstrate that the prosecutor\u2019s decision \u2018was based on an unconstitutional motive.\u2019\u201d <em>Rowsey v. Lee, </em>327 F.3d 335, 343 (4th Cir.2003) (citation omitted). In other words, a selective prosecution claim requires a showing that \u201cthe prosecutor has brought the charge for reasons forbidden by the Constitution.\u201d <em>Armstrong, </em>517 U.S. at 463,116 S.Ct. at 1486. The claim cannot succeed without proof that the prosecution was \u201c \u2018deliberately based upon an unjustifiable standard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary classification,\u2019 including the exercise of protected statutory and constitutional rights.\u201d <em>Wayte, </em>470 U.S. at 608, 105 S.Ct. at 1531 (quoting <em>Bordenkircher, </em>434 U.S. at 364, 98 S.Ct. at 668; <em>Oyler v. Boles, </em>368 U.S. 448, 456, 82 S.Ct. 501, 506, 7 L.Ed.2d 446 (1962), and citing <em>United States v. Goodwin, </em>457 U.S. 368, 372, 102 S.Ct. 2485, 2488, 73 L.Ed.2d 74 (1982)) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">Appellants\u2019 as-applied selective prosecution claim fails for the same reason their content-based attack fails: The dancers have no First Amendment right to wear pasties and G-strings rather than the lingerie-like tops and bottoms required by the Henrico ordinance. Because the ordinance involves a content-neutral regulation of conduct that does not unduly burden any protected erotic speech, appellants cannot claim they were being targeted for constitutionally suspect reasons. Put another way, appellants cannot show that Henri-co prosecuted them <em>\u201cbecause of\u2019 </em>their expression of constitutionally protected speech. <em>Wayte, </em>470 U.S. at 610, 105 S.Ct. at 1532 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">Second, the selective prosecution claim, having been rejected by the factfinder at trial, can only succeed on appeal if the facts demonstrate it as a matter.of law. The factual record cannot support this showing. No evidence proved any \u201ctechnical violations\u201d had in fact occurred in Henrico County. Appellants\u2019 argument on this point, as well as the prosecutor\u2019s remarks about it, involve purely hypothetical situations \u2014 the most fanciful being the observation that the enforcement of the public nudity ban would \u201cpermit Jennifer Lopez to wear one famously revealing dress,\u201d but might prohibit her from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>wearing others. <em>See post, </em>at 536, 592 S.E.2d at 788 (quoting the federal court\u2019s abstention order). Once one gets beyond the hypotheticals, no evidence in this case demonstrated that the prosecutors had used the ordinance to target erotic dancing. Just the opposite was shown: Thirty-eight individuals had been prosecuted under the public nudity ban, and this one case involves the only application of the ordinance against erotic dancers.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">Finally, even if the hypothetical \u201ctechnical cases\u201d were real, the secondary effects doctrine provides a constitutionally adequate basis for judicial deference to prosecutorial discretion where no underlying constitutional infringement exists. <em>See generally Erie, </em>529 U.S. at 295, 120 S.Ct. at 1394 (recognizing \u201cthat one specific occurrence of public nudity\u2014 nude erotic dancing \u2014 is particularly problematic because it produces harmful secondary effects\u201d). The impact on the local community of a strip club featuring erotic dancers can hardly be equated with nursing mothers in public restaurants, swimmers at a neighborhood pool, or, for that matter, a surprise visit from a scantily-clad Jennifer Lopez. For the same reason the secondary effects principle provides legitimacy to the governmental interest in regulating the business of erotica, it also explains why prosecutors may make commonsense distinctions between nursing mothers and swimmers, on the one hand, and erotic dancers, flashers, and public urinators, on the other.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">D. <em>The County Had Authority To Enact A Public Nudity Ordinance.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">Appellants next claim that the Henrico public nudity ordinance exceeds the County\u2019s local governmental powers. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>We disagree and hold that the ordinance involves a legitimate exercise of delegable state police powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">Under Code \u00a7 15.2-1200, a county may \u201cadopt such measures as it deems expedient to secure and promote the health, safety and general welfare of its inhabitants which are not inconsistent with the general laws of the Commonwealth.\u201d <footnotemark>15</footnotemark> This delegation of police powers includes the power to regulate nude and semi-nude dancing. <em>See Wayside Rest., Inc., </em>215 Va. at 283, 208 S.E.2d at 53 (finding power implicit in county\u2019s power to prohibit \u201cconduct which the local governing body reasonably deems to be contrary to the morals, health, safety and general welfare of the community\u201d); <em>see, e.g., Erie, </em>529 U.S. at 296, 120 S.Ct. at 1395 (\u201cErie\u2019s efforts to protect public health and safety are clearly within the city\u2019s police powers.\u201d); <em>Barnes, </em>501 U.S. at 569, 111 S.Ct. at 2462 (recognizing that \u201cthe traditional police powers of the States,\u201d defined as \u201cthe authority to provide for the public health, safety, and morals,\u201d provides a legitimate basis for public indecency statutes).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">We also reject appellants\u2019 assertion that the Henrico public nudity ordinance, while an otherwise valid expression of the general police power, should be invalidated because it goes further than state laws proscribing obscenity and indecent exposure. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-375, 18.2-387. \u201cThe mere fact that the state, in the exercise of the police power, has made certain regulations, does not prohibit a municipality from exacting additional requirements.\u201d <em>Wayside Rest., Inc., </em>215 Va. at 234, 208 S.E.2d at 53 (quoting <em>King v. Arlington County, </em>195 Va. 1084, 1090, 81 S.E.2d 587, 591 (1954)). This remains true as long as the locality \u201cdoes not attempt to authorize by the ordinance what the legislature has forbidden <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>or forbid what the legislature has expressly licensed, authorized, or required.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 234, 208 S.E.2d at 54.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-4\">E. <em>The Evidence Supports The Trial Court\u2019s Findings Of Fact.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">Finally, appellants argue the trial court plainly erred in finding that their semi-nude dancing did not fall within the ordinance\u2019s exemption for the performance of any \u201cplay, ballet, drama, tableau, production or motion picture in any theater, concert hall, museum of fine arts, school, institution of higher learning or other similar establishment which is primarily devoted to such exhibitions, presentations, shows or performances as a form of expression of opinion, communication, speech, ideas, information, art or drama.\u201d Henrico County Code \u00a7 13 \u2014 107(c). The trial court found as a fact that Gold City was not a \u201ctheater,\u201d and the dancers were not engaged in any \u201ctheatrical performance either.\u201d These conclusions, appellants contend, fail to take into account their unique \u201cmoves using the pole mounted on the bar,\u201d the \u201cspecial costumes\u201d worn (albeit briefly) during the dance, as well as the overall context of their dancing.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">The trial judge\u2019s factual findings cannot be disturbed on appeal unless no \u201crational trier of fact\u201d could have come to the conclusions he did. <em>Kelly v.

He did not, however, state how he would distinguish between a \u201ctechnical\u201d violation and those before the trial court. Instead, he conceded that the prosecutions at issue here were driven by his opinion of the content of the performances at Gold City.

Rather than continuing to issue summonses, the officer \u201cjust brought it to Ms. White\u2019s attention that the way they were dressed they were still in violation and that she had to bring them into compliance.\u201d Hence, I conclude there was selective enforcement of the ordinance both as to Gold City generally and with respect to particular dancers in Gold City. \u201cA vague law impermissibly delegates basic policy matters to policemen, judges, and juries for resolution on an <em>ad hoc </em>and subjective basis, with the attendant dangers of arbitrary and discriminatory application.\u201d <em>Grayned, </em>408 U.S at 108-09, 92 S.Ct. at 2299.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">\n<em>Content-based Regulation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">\u201cTo safeguard free speech, the Supreme Court requires that a regulatory measure be content neutral.

Mosley, </em>408 U.S. 92, 95, 92 S.Ct. 2286, 2290, 33 L.Ed.2d 212 (1972)).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">The Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney\u2019s subjective opinion demonstrated that the prosecutions in these cases were based \u201cprimarily\u201d upon his opinion of the <em>content </em>of the performances. This focus on the content of appellants\u2019 conduct at Gold City renders the County\u2019s application of the ordinance in these cases unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-8\">\u201c[N]ude [or semi-nude] dancing of the kind sought to be performed here is expressive conduct within the outer perimeters of the First Amendment, though we view it as only marginally so.\u201d <em>Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., 501 U.S. 560, </em>566, 111 S.Ct. 2456, 2460, 115 L.Ed.2d 504 (1991). According<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>ly, \u201cgovernment restrictions on public nudity such as the ordinance at issue here should be evaluated under the framework set forth in <em>[United States v.] O\u2019Brien[, </em>391 U.S. 367, 88 S.Ct. 1673, 20 L.Ed.2d 672 (1968),] for content-neutral restrictions on symbolic speech.\u201d <em>Erie v. Pap\u2019s A.M., </em>529 U.S. 277, 289, 120 S.Ct. 1382, 1391, 146 L.Ed.2d 265 (2000). That test provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-4\">a government regulation is sufficiently justified if it is within the constitutional power of the Government; if it furthers an important or substantial governmental interest; if the governmental interest is unrelated to the suppression of free expression; and if the incidental restriction on alleged First Amendment freedoms is no greater than is essential to the furtherance of that interest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b581-5\"><em>O\u2019Brien, </em>391 U.S. at 377, 88 S.Ct. at 1679. Appellants conceded at trial that the County \u201csurely\u201d has the authority to enact the ordinance. Thus, the first prong in <em>O\u2019Brien </em>is met. Appellants argue, however, that the ordinance does not further a substantial government interest; it is impermissibly related to the suppression of protected expressive conduct, namely erotic dancing; and that it is not sufficiently narrowly tailored to satisfy <em>O\u2019Brien.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">The second part of the <em>O\u2019Brien </em>test requires that the ordinance further a substantial government interest. I agree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the ordinance \u201cfurthers a substantial government interest in protecting order and morality.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Therefore, the ordinance satisfies <em>O\u2019Brien\u2019s </em>second requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">Under the third prong of <em>O\u2019Brien </em>\u201cthe governmental interest must be unrelated to the suppression of free expression.\u201d <em>Barnes, </em>501 U.S. at 570, 111 S.Ct. at 2463. Although the purpose for which the ordinance was adopted satisfies this requirement, the application of the ordinance in these cases is problematic. Henrico County adopted the ordinance in 1982 to combat the problems of public urination, exposure of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>buttocks (i.e., \u201cmooning\u201d) and skinny dipping.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The ordinance provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-5\">(a) As used in this section, the term \u201cstate of nudity\u201d means a state of undress so as to expose the human male or female genitals, pubic area or buttocks or to cover any of them with less than a fully opaque covering, or the showing of the female breast or any portion thereof below the top of the nipple, or covering of the breast or any portion thereof below the top of the nipple with less than a fully opaque covering.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-6\">(b) Every person who knowingly, voluntarily and intentionally appears in public or in a public place or in a place open to the public or open to public view in a state of nudity, or employs, encourages or procures another person so to appear, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by confinement in jail for not more than six months or a fine of not more than $500.00, or both.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-7\">(c) Nothing contained in this section shall be construed to apply to the exhibition, presentation, showing or performance of any play, ballet, drama, tableau, production or motion picture in any theater, concert hall, museum of fine arts, school, institution of higher learning or other similar establishment which is primarily devoted to such exhibitions, presentations, shows or performances as a form of expression of opinion, communication, speech, ideas, information, art or drama.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b583-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>Henrico County Code \u00a7 13-107. In contrast, the ordinances at issue in <em>Barnes </em>and <em>Pap\u2019s AM. </em>were flat bans on all public nudity and specifically required dancers to wear G-strings and pasties. <em>Barnes, </em>501 U.S. at 563, 111 S.Ct. at 2458-59; <em>Pap\u2019s A.M., </em>529 U.S. at 284, 120 S.Ct. at 1388.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-5\">The ordinance here, like the statute in <em>Barnes, </em>is on its face a general prohibition on public nudity. By its terms, the ordinance regulates conduct alone. It does not target nudity that contains an erotic message; rather, it bans all public nudity, regardless of whether that nudity is accompanied by expressive activity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b583-6\"><em>Pap\u2019s A.M., </em>529 U.S. at 290, 120 S.Ct. at 1391. Furthermore, the ordinance in <em>Pap\u2019s AM. </em>specifically included theaters and dance halls. Thus, they satisfied the third prong of the <em>O\u2019Brien </em>test, because they were directed solely at conduct without reference to expression.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">In the instant cases, subsection (c) of the ordinance creates certain exemptions for nude performances, including those performed in theaters. The Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney stated that he did not believe Gold City fell within subsection (c) based on his opinion of the content of the performances at Gold City. This express reference to content brings the County\u2019s enforcement of the ordinance into the realm of First Amendment protections because those enforcing the ordinance must make content-based distinctions. <em>See, e.g., Texas v. Johnson, </em>491 U.S. 397, 414, 109 S.Ct. 2533, 2545, 105 L.Ed.2d 342 (1989) (\u201cIf there is a bedrock principle underlying the First Amendment, it is that the government may not prohibit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>the expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea itself offensive or disagreeable.\u201d); <em>IOTA XI v. George Mason University, </em>993 F.2d 386 (4th Cir.1993) (an exception for theatrical productions cannot be limited \u201cto protect only a narrow and limited category of professionally produced plays\u201d rather, even \u201ccrude and amateurish and perhaps unappealing\u201d performances \u201ccome within the First Amendment\u2019s reach\u201d); <em>see also Barnes, </em>501 U.S. at 594, 111 S.Ct. at 2475 (\u201cWhile the entertainment afforded by a nude ballet at Lincoln Center to those who can pay the price may differ vastly in content (as viewed by judges) or in quality (as viewed by critics), it may not differ in substance from the dance viewed by the person who wants some \u2018entertainment\u2019 with his beer or shot of rye.\u201d) (White, J. dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">As applied by the County in the instant cases, the ordinance delineates a type of expressive conduct permitted under limited circumstances and bans other types of expressive conduct that fall within the First Amendment\u2019s protection, albeit on the \u201couter limits\u201d of such protection. The County argues that the exemption in subsection (c) is a \u201ctime, place and manner\u201d regulation. Although this argument has appeal, given the express limitations on venue, the County\u2019s enforcement in these cases does not satisfy the \u201calternative avenues of communication\u201d requirement for time, place and manner regulations. <em>City of Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., </em>475 U.S. 41, 47, 106 S.Ct. 925, 928, 89 L.Ed.2d 29 (1986).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The County\u2019s application of the ordinance does not provide for an alternative venue within the County to convey the \u201cerotic message,\u201d as required by the United States Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">The fourth prong of <em>O'Brien </em>requires \u201cthe incidental restriction on alleged First Amendment freedoms [be] no greater than is essential to the furtherance of that interest.\u201d <em>O'Brien, </em>391 U.S. at 377, 88 S.Ct. at 1679. This prong highlights another important distinction between the instant cases and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number><em>Barnes </em>and <em>Pap\u2019s A.M. </em>In the latter, exotic dancing in pasties and G-strings was permitted; however, the dancers sought instead to dance completely nude. In upholding the ordinances in both cases, the Court held that \u201cany incidental impact on the expressive element of nude dancing is <em>de minimis. </em>The requirement that dancers wear pasties and G-strings is a minimal restriction in furtherance of the asserted government interests, and the restriction leaves ample capacity to convey the dancer\u2019s erotic message.\u201d <em>Pap\u2019s A.M., </em>529 U.S. at 301, 120 S.Ct. at 1397; <em>see also Barnes, </em>501 U.S. at 572, 111 S.Ct. at 2463 (\u201crequirement that the dancers wear at least pasties and G-strings is modest, and the bare minimum necessary to achieve the State\u2019s purpose\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">In the instant cases, the legislative intent underlying the ordinance was to prevent urinating in public and similar problems. The County conceded that exotic dancing was not the activity it sought to regulate when the ordinance was adopted. Viewed in the context of its legislative history, the ordinance as applied is not narrowly drawn so that the incidental restriction on the expressive conduct at issue is no greater than is essential to prevent or deter public urination, \u201cmooning\u201d or skinny dipping.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">In summary, I agree with the U.S. District Court\u2019s reasoning that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-7\">[T]he Supreme Court of the United States views nude dancing [as] expressive conduct that is entitled to some quantum of protection under the First Amendment. Hence, though the subject matter here is, as the Plaintiffs admit, mundane, it involves a well-settled right under the First Amendment. The exercise of that right may be circumscribed by local law, but the law, as applied, must allow the conduct permitted by the First Amendment. The law, of course, must clearly define the proscribed conduct and must be enforced equally, and not arbitrarily or capriciously, when it is applicable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-8\">When measured against these precepts, the Ordinance is troublesome. On its face, as admitted by the Common<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>wealth\u2019s Attorney, the Ordinance would make it unlawful for a mother to nurse her child in public, conduct that often occurs in today\u2019s society and that is widely accepted. It, by admission of the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney, would prohibit the wearing of bathing suits commonly sold in the County and worn at its public pools and at private clubs, though the Ordinance would not necessarily be enforced against each technical violation. Though admitting that both were technically violative of the Ordinance, the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney would permit Jennifer Lopez to wear one famously revealing dress, but prohibit her from wearing another as to which it is difficult to discern a difference. Some of these violations would be prosecuted; others would not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-5\">The Ordinance contains a provision, section (c), that permits the very conduct engaged in by and at Gold City to be performed in a different, but nonetheless public, venue. Mr. Kizer testified that, while a ballet at a dance hall, featuring completely nude dancers for the duration of the performance, would not be prohibited by the Ordinance, dancing in pasties and G-strings on the stage at Gold City does not fall under the exception. Section (c) has serious exposure to constitutional challenge as to its application, especially in perspective of Mr. Kizer\u2019s testimony that the content of constitutionally protected expressive conduct plays a role in assessing whether that conduct violates the Ordinance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b586-6\"><em>Colonial First Properties, </em>166 F.Supp.2d at 1090.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">I would reverse the judgment of the trial court and dismiss the convictions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b576-12\">. Appellants assert several additional constitutional arguments, including that the ordinance constitutes a regulatory taking. However, these arguments were not raised in the trial court and thus are waived. Rule 5A:18.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b578-5\">. The County correctly notes that breast feeding is statutorily exempted from the indecent exposure statute, so no prosecution could follow under state Code \u00a7 18.2-387.
