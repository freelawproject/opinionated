Green, Jr. appeals orders of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission compelling him to respond to certain discovery requests submitted by Keil Plumbing and Heating and WCAMC Contractors\u2019 Group Self-Insurance Association (collectively \u201cemployer\u201d). Specifically, Green contends the commission erred in finding that he failed to timely file his response to employer\u2019s motion to compel, by ordering him to respond to four interrogatory questions and to complete an IRS Form 4506,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and by refusing to \u201cwithdraw\u201d its order directing him to do so.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Because we find that we lack jurisdiction to consider Green\u2019s claims, we dismiss Green\u2019s appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-10\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b590-11\">Green sustained an injury while working for employer on June 6, 1996. Employer accepted the injury as compensable, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>and the commission thereafter awarded Green benefits in the form of weekly temporary total disability compensation, beginning June 19, 1997 and continuing, as well as lifetime medical benefits. As of the date of this appeal, both awards remained open.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-4\">In February of 2003, employer propounded interrogatories and requests for production to Green requesting information concerning his employment status, his banking records, and his income tax records. Green responded to these requests with a \u201cgeneral objection\u201d contending that, pursuant to commission Rule 1:8, employer \u201clack[ed] standing\u201d to request the information because \u201cno application or claim [was] currently before the Commission.\u201d Green otherwise provided some of the information requested but refused to respond further to the requests \u201cunless ordered to do so by the Commission.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">On March 12, 2003, employer filed a motion to compel Green to respond to the interrogatories and request for production of documents, contending that pursuant to commission precedent interpreting Rule 1:8, employer had a \u201cright to discover medical evidence relevant to [Green\u2019s] physical and mental condition, as well as a right to discover wage information,\u201d \u201cwhere there is an open award <em>for at least medical benefits.\u201d </em>(Emphasis in original). Employer attached \"with its motion a copy of Green\u2019s responses to its discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">On March 18, 2003, Green filed a \u201cResponse to [Employer\u2019s Motion to Compel],\u201d contending that employer\u2019s discovery requests were \u201cnot permissible under Rule 1:8 ... and [that employer had] made no showing that [Green was] working.\u201d In the response, Green requested that the commission enter an award of sanctions against employer because employer brought \u201cthese proceedings with no reasonable grounds.\u201d Green also filed an additional copy of his earlier responses to employer\u2019s discovery requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">The following day, and apparently without having yet reviewed Green\u2019s response to employer\u2019s motion to compel, the deputy commissioner sent Green a letter, ordering Green to respond to employer\u2019s motion within ten days. The deputy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>commissioner advised Green that the issue of a claimant\u2019s ongoing disability is \u201calways a relevant issue before the Commission,\u201d but requested that he respond \u201cwithin the time period noted\u201d if the matter was \u201catypical.\u201d Green did not file an additional response.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">On April 16, 2003, employer sent a letter to the commission contending that Green had failed to \u201crespond to the ... motion to compel.\u201d Accordingly, employer requested that the commission order Green to \u201crespond to this discovery as specifically outlined within that motion to compel.\u201d Green responded to the employer\u2019s letter by notifying the commission that he had, in fact, responded to the motion to compel on March 18, 2003. Nevertheless, the deputy commissioner entered an order on May 1, 2003, explicitly finding that Green had failed to respond to the motion to compel, and \u201ctherefore\u201d directing Green to \u201ccompletely respond\u201d to the discovery as requested by employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">Green subsequently filed a request for review by the full commission, contending that the deputy commissioner had erred in finding he had not responded to the motion to compel, and in ordering him to respond to the discovery requests. In response to employer\u2019s motion to compel, the full commission ultimately ordered Green to comply with the discovery requests. Specifically, the commission found that because Green was subject to an open award there were \u201cissues pending\u201d before the commission pursuant to Rule 1:8, ma.king the discovery permissible. Thereafter, Green filed a motion to reconsider with the full commission. Green also filed a notice of appeal to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">In response to Green\u2019s motion to reconsider, the full commission again ordered Green to comply with the discovery as requested by employer. Green then filed an additional notice of appeal with this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b592-8\">In this consolidated appeal, Green raises six Questions Presented. During oral argument, we considered the merits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>of these issues; however, on our own motion, we also ordered the parties to file additional briefs analyzing whether Green\u2019s appeals to this Court were properly taken, pursuant to Code \u00a7 17.1-405. Finding that they were not, we now dismiss Green\u2019s appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-4\">We begin by recognizing that Green\u2019s appellate issues are related to a discovery dispute before the commission, and related discovery orders.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-5\">The Court of Appeals is invested with appellate jurisdiction over \u201c[a]ny final decision\u201d of the commission or related interlocutory order \u201c(i) granting, dissolving or denying an injunction or (ii) adjudicating the principles of a cause.\u201d Code \u00a7 17.1-405. A final decision \u201c \u2018disposes of the whole subject, gives all the relief that is contemplated, and leaves nothing to be done by the [commission].\u2019 \u201d <em>Southwest Virginia Hosps., Inc. v. Lipps, </em>193 Va. 191, 193, 68 S.E.2d 82, 83-84 (1951) (quoting <em>Ryan v. McLeod, </em>73 Va. (32 Gratt.) 367, 376 (1879)).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b593-6\"><em>City of Richmond-Fire &amp; Emergency v. Brandon, </em>32 Va.App. 787, 789, 531 S.E.2d 22, 22 (2000). We find that the commission\u2019s discovery orders in this case do not constitute \u201cfinal decisions,\u201d properly appealable to this Court pursuant to Code \u00a7 17.1-405. We reach this finding on two bases.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">First, discovery proceedings before the commission are authorized and governed by Code \u00a7 65.2-703, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-8\">A. Any party to a proceeding under this title may serve interrogatories or cause the depositions of witnesses residing within or without the Commonwealth to be taken, the costs to be taxed as other costs by the Commission. All interrogatories, depositions, or any other discovery shall conform to rules governing discovery promulgated by the Commission.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-9\">B. The Commission shall adopt rules governing discovery conforming as nearly as practicable to Part Four of the Rules of the Virginia Supreme Court. Such rules shall be adopted in accordance with and pursuant to the Administrative Process Act (\u00a7 9-6.14:1 et seq.).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b594-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>As is clear by the plain language of the statute, Code \u00a7 65.2-703 does not provide an avenue of appeal from a commission decision to grant or deny discovery, which is separate and apart from a legal proceeding before that administrative body. Indeed, with the exception of provisions concerning appeals from fines and penalties levied by the commission for failure to maintain evidence of compliance with the requirements of Title 65.2, the only provision concerning appeals from commission action is found in Code \u00a7 65.2-706. <em>See Jewell Ridge Coal v. Henderson, </em>229 Va. 266, 269, 329 S.E.2d 48, 50 (1985); <em>see </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 65.2-805, -807 and -902 (pertaining to fines and penalties). In relevant part, Code \u00a7 65.2-706 states that \u201c[n]o appeal shall be taken from the decision of one commissioner until a review of the case has been had before the full Commission ... and an <em>award </em>entered by it. Appeals shall lie <em>from such award </em>to the Court of Appeals in the manner provided in the Rules of the Supreme Court.\u201d (Emphases added). The Supreme Court of Virginia has defined the words \u201csuch award,\u201d as used in Code \u00a7 65.2-706 (formerly Code \u00a7 65.1-98), to \u201cmean [a] final award, that is, a decision of the [commission] granting or denying, or changing or refusing to change, some benefit payable or allowable under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act and leaving nothing to be done except to superintend ministerially the execution of the award.\u201d <em>Jewell Ridge, </em>229 Va. at 269, 329 S.E.2d at 50.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">The \u201cCommission\u2019s action involved in the present cases obviously does not begin to satisfy the final award test.\u201d <em>Id. </em>No part of the commission\u2019s decisions affected, in any manner, any benefit payable or allowable to Green under the Act. In fact, the commission\u2019s decisions could not have affected the open award. Green\u2019s award had long since been final, leaving nothing for the commission to do but to superintend its administration. <em>See Holly Farms v. Carter, </em>15 Va.App. 29, 34, 422 S.E.2d 165, 167 (1992). Furthermore, neither of the parties, nor the commission <em>sua sponte, </em>had filed an application for review of Green\u2019s award on the basis of a change in condition, pursuant to Code \u00a7 65.2-708. Nor does the record <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>reflect that Green was held in contempt or sanctioned for failing to comply with the commission\u2019s orders.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b595-4\">Second, as stated above, \u201c[a] final decision is one \u2018which disposes of the whole subject, gives all the relief that is contemplated and leaves nothing to be done by the court.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hoyle v. Virginia Employment Commission, </em>24 Va.App. 533, 537, 484 S.E.2d 132,133 (1997) (quoting <em>Lipps, </em>193 Va. at 193, 68 S.E.2d at 83 (citation omitted)). Consistent with this principle, \u201c[ojrdinarily, ... discovery orders are not subject to review on direct appeal because they are not final within the contemplation of Code \u00a7 [17.1-405].\u201d <em>America Online v. Anonymous Publicly Traded Co., </em>261 Va. 350, 358, 542 S.E.2d 377, 381 (2001). This is true because, in most cases, the \u201corder in dispute neither adjudicates the underlying cause nor relates to an attendant injunction, but simply resolves an issue arising from discovery incidental to the claim, clearly an interlocutory determination over which this Court has no jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Brandon, </em>32 Va.App. at 789, 531 S.E.2d at 23. Although the commission here may have disposed of the issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>concerning the discovery, the commission\u2019s decision did not dispose of the \u201cwhole subject\u201d at issue-which involved, by the parties\u2019 and the commission\u2019s own concessions, Green\u2019s underlying open award for benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">As stated above, the record reflects that Green\u2019s rights regarding compensation have thus far not been affected. Therefore, it is clear that the commission\u2019s \u201cdecisions\u201d were not final, appealable decisions as contemplated by Code \u00a7\u00a7 17.1-405 and 65.2-706. Instead, the decisions were merely interlocutory orders that \u201cneither adjudicate[d] the underlying cause nor relate[d] to an attendant injunction.\u201d <em>Brandon, </em>32 Va.App. at 789, 531 S.E.2d at 23. Accordingly, we find that we have no jurisdiction to consider these issues under the circumstances of this ease, and we thus dismiss Green\u2019s appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">\n<em>Dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b590-12\">. In his brief on appeal, Green states that he \"has provided [employer] with an IRS Form 4506 that has been signed\u201d by him and that this \"issue has been resolved between the parties.\u201d Employer does not dispute these statements. Accordingly, we do not address this particular issue further in this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b590-13\">. Although Green's appeals have been assigned separate case numbers, they arise out of the same proceedings and involve similar assignments of error. Accordingly, we consolidate them for purposes of appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b595-5\">. <em>See Jeff Coal, Inc. v. Phillips, </em>16 Va.App. 271, 278, 430 S.E.2d 712, 717 (1993) (\u201cWe [have held] that the commission has the same authority as a court to punish for noncompliance with its discoveiy orders.\u201d); <em>see also </em>Code \u00a7 65.2-202 (stating, in pertinent part, that \"the Commission or any member or deputy commissioner shall have authority to enforce the attendance of all parties in interest and of witnesses and the production and examination of books, papers and records and to punish for contempt or disobedience of its orders as is vested in courts and judges....\u201d); <em>Vokes v. Vokes, </em>28 Va.App. 349, 355, 504 S.E.2d 865, 868 (1998) (noting that \"a contempt order is ... appealable if it adjudicates all issues of guilt and imposes a sentence\u201d (citation omitted)). <em>See also </em>the United States Supreme Court decision in <em>Church of Scientology v. United States, </em>506 U.S. 9, 18, n. 11, 113 S.Ct. 447, 452, 121 L.Ed.2d 313 (1992), noting that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-6\">[t]here is a distinction in the law between the enforcement of discovery orders directed at parties and the enforcement of discovery orders directed at disinterested third parties, but that distinction derives from concerns regarding finality, not mootness. <em>As a general rule, a district court\u2019s order enforcing a discovery request is not a \u201cfinal order\u2019\u2019 subject to appellate review. A party that seeks to present an objection to a discovery order immediately to a court of appeals must refuse compliance, be held in contempt, and then appeal the contempt order.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"A8D\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
