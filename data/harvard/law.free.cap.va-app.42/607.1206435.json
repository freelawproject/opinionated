FRANK, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">David Gordon Bragg (appellant) was convicted in a bench trial of five counts of embezzlement, in violation of Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-111 and 18.2-95.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On appeal, he does not contest his general guilt, but contends the trial court erred in finding him guilty of five counts instead of one. He argues the single larceny doctrine required the trial court to find him guilty on only one count. Finding the single larceny doctrine does not apply to the facts of this case, we affirm the five convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">The facts are not in dispute.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appellant was one of two volunteer treasurers for St. Andrews United Methodist Church in Virginia Beach. Appellant\u2019s duties allowed him to write and sign checks on behalf of the church and reconcile the church\u2019s bank accounts. Beginning on or about December 9, 1999, he began embezzling money from the church. Upon the end of his term as treasurer, the new treasurer discovered the discrepancies in the church\u2019s accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-8\">Approximately 142 checks, worth $82,130.40, had been \u201cwritten outside the scope of [appellant\u2019s] authority and to his benefit.\u201d Appellant used church funds to pay a number of personal debts, including his mortgage, his cell phone bill, a car loan, and other personal expenses. On several occasions, he made the checks payable to himself and indicated \u201cpayroll\u201d on the checks.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-9\">Appellant admitted to the police that he had embezzled money from the church to pay personal bills. During the pretrial hearing on appellant\u2019s motion to merge the five counts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>into one count of embezzlement, appellant testified, \u201cI was broke. I had no money. I was getting ready to lose everything.\u201d He took the church funds \u201c[t]o continue living.\u201d However, appellant admitted he wrote checks to a friend \u201cfor computer work that he did for me,\u201d gave another individual a check for $750 on Christmas Eve of 1999, and took the same person with him on a trip to Israel, costing $3,572. All of these expenses were incurred after appellant began embezzling from the church, when he claimed he needed the funds to cover living expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">On cross-examination, the following exchange took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-6\">[PROSECUTOR]: But you didn\u2019t start off in the beginning saying, I\u2019m going to use church funds to write my mortgage payment every time it comes up, did you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-7\">[APPELLANT]: Well, no. I wouldn\u2019t say I did that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-8\">[PROSECUTOR]: Because it was your intention not to write another check? Each time you would write one, your thought would be, This is the last time I\u2019m doing this; isn\u2019t that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-9\">[APPELLANT]: Yes, certainly, because I wanted to pay the money back obviously.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b660-10\">Appellant argued that the five indictments should be merged into one because \u201cit was a continuous desire to take the money for on-going bills.... \u201d The Commonwealth argued the embezzlement was a series of individual impulses. In denying appellant\u2019s motion for merger, the trial court found appellant was taking money \u201cas the need arose.\u201d The trial court found no \u201cregular pattern\u201d in the dates or groupings of the checks. The trial court concluded the funds were embezzled on \u201cindividual impulses\u201d and were not based on a \u201cpreformulated plan\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-11\">He embezzled these funds as the needs arose and his bills came due and that to some extent is corroborated or reflected in the dates and groupings of the checks and in the time intervals that exist between the various checks that are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>set forth in the Defendant\u2019s Exhibit 1. There is no \u2014 it\u2019s not a regular pattern. It seems to be consistent with exactly what he said [in his testimony today].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-5\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-6\">[\u00b6] e was apparently incurring substantial personal debt for what would be \u2014 most people would consider discretionary items, such as trips and expenses for other individuals that were the objects of his bounty, so to speak, and that apparently, at least in one instance, he was putting on his MasterCard or Visa or charge card; and then when that bill came due, he embezzled the funds to pay that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">\n<em>ANALYSIS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b661-8\">Appellant contends he should be convicted of only one count of embezzlement under the single larceny doctrine since he wrote the 142 checks under a \u201csingle impulse.\u201d We disagree.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b661-9\">In <em>Richardson v. Commonwealth, </em>25 Va.App. 491, 497, 489 S.E.2d 697, 700 (1997) <em>(en banc), </em>we held, \u201c[u]nless the evidence proves that two or more separate and discrete thefts occurred at separate times which were not part of the same larcenous impulse, then thefts from the same room are but a single larceny.\u201d This Court explained the factors to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>consider in <em>Acey v. Commonwealth, </em>29 Va.App. 240, 247, 511 S.E.2d 429, 432 (1999):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-4\">A series of larcenous acts will be considered a single count of larceny if they \u201care done pursuant to a single impulse and in execution of a general fraudulent scheme.\u201d <em>West v. Commonwealth, </em>125 Va. 747, 754, 99 S.E. 654, 656 (1919). We must consider the following factors when deciding whether the single larceny doctrine applies: (1) the location of the items taken, (2) the lapse of time between the takings, (3) the general and specific intent of the taker, (4) the number of owners of the items taken and (5) whether intervening events occurred between the takings. <em>See Richardson v. Commonwealth, </em>25 Va.App. 491, 497, 489 S.E.2d 697, 700 (1997). \u201cThe primary factor to be considered is the intent of the thief....\u201d <em>See id.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">As this analysis turns on the particular facts of a case, <em>see Richardson, </em>25 Va.App. at 497-98, 489 S.E.2d at 700-01, we will affirm the trial court\u2019s determination unless plainly wrong or unless the record lacks any evidence to \u2022 support that determination, <em>see Byers v. Commonwealth, </em>37 Va.App. 174, 179, 554 S.E.2d 714, 716 (2001). Thus, our inquiry is whether the evidence supports the fact finder\u2019s determination that the acts of embezzlement were individual impulses and not committed under a \u201c \u2018single impulse and in execution of a general fraudulent scheme.\u2019 \u201d <em>Richardson, </em>25 Va.App. at 496, 489 S.E.2d at 700 (quoting <em>West, </em>125 Va. at 754, 99 S.E. at 656).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">Clearly, appellant had a general scheme or intent to steal. However, a series of thefts committed under a general scheme is not the controlling factor in determining whether the single larceny doctrine applies. As this Court stated in <em>Richardson, </em>\u201ca series of thefts committed in rapid succession pursuant to a general scheme to steal from distinct locations, such as different shops, stores, or buildings, will constitute separate offenses.\u201d 25 Va.App. at 497, 489 S.E.2d at 700. In such cases, \u201c[t]he primary factor to be considered is the intent of the thief and the question to be asked is whether the thefts, although occurring successively within a brief time frame, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>were part of one impulse.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">We must decide whether appellant acted under the same impulse or different impulses in each of the five time periods set forth in the indictments.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We review the facts of this case in light of the factors in <em>Acey.</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The church was the only victim, perhaps suggesting a single intent. However, the lapse of time between the offenses was significant \u2014 twenty-five months from the first act of embezzlement to the last. Such a length of time, under these circumstances, constitutes a factor indicating the acts were separate. Typical cases finding one transaction commonly involve more contemporaneous acts. <em>See Acey, </em>29 Va.App. at 247, 511 S.E.2d at 432 (finding \u201cno appreciable lapse of time\u201d between larcenous acts); <em>Millard v. Commonwealth, </em>34 Va.App. 202, 207, 539 S.E.2d 84, 86 (2000) (finding one transaction where three checks were presented to a bank teller); <em>Richardson, </em>25 Va.App. at 497, 489 S.E.2d at 700 (considering thefts that occurred \u201cwithin a brief time frame\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">Appellant\u2019s testimony is especially relevant, as it indicates his intent throughout the various time periods. He testified he did not form a general plan to steal church funds every time a bill came due. This testimony supports the trial court\u2019s finding that appellant acted on individual impulses, not to further a general scheme. Appellant testified that, when an individual debt was due, it created the \u201cneed\u201d to embezzle again. He claimed that he cashed the checks to \u201ccontinue living\u201d because he could not pay his bills otherwise. Accord<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>ing to his own testimony, appellant did not intend to continue taking money from the church. Only when a debt arose that he could not pay from his own income would he cash a check from the church. After paying that debt, he had no intention to embezzle again. These debts were intervening acts that created individualized intentions to embezzle.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">Further, the trial court properly concluded that appellant, by using funds for making gifts to third parties, evidenced a series of single impulses. Appellant\u2019s bills for computer services, his extravagant gifts, and his international trip rebutted any general and continuing need for basic living expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">Appellant cites <em>Challenor v. Commonwealth, </em>209 Va. 789, 167 S.E.2d 116 (1969), to support his argument that the checks were signed and cashed as the result of a single impulse. His reliance is misplaced. The issue in <em>Challenor </em>was whether an indictment charging the defendant with embezzling funds over a thirty-month period complied with Code \u00a7 19.1-168 (recodified at Code \u00a7 19.2-223), which permitted a single indictment for \u201c \u2018any number of distinct acts of ... embezzlements ... which may have been committed ... within six months from the first to the last of the acts charged in the indictment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 792, 167 S.E.2d at 118. The Supreme Court found the indictment charged \u201c \u2018a continuous plan or scheme and a single offense of embezzlement\u2019 \u201d and, thus, did not violate the Code section. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Webb v. Commonwealth, </em>204 Va. 24, 32, 129 S.E.2d 22, 28 (1963)). From this ruling, appellant argues that all embezzlement is a continuous plan or scheme. However, <em>Challenor </em>did not address the definition of embezzlement or the application of the single larceny doctrine. Instead, it addresses an issue based on the agreed presumption that a continuous plan or scheme occurred. As the parties here disagree on whether a continuous plan existed, we find <em>Challenor </em>inapplicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">Additionally, Code \u00a7 19.2-223, the recodification of Code \u00a7 19.1-168 as considered in <em>Challenor, </em>specifically refers to \u201cany number of distinct acts.\u201d Regarding this particular language, <em>Mechling v. Slayton, </em>361 F.Supp. 770 (E.D.Va.1973), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>is instructive. Mechling used 204 separate bank withdrawal slips to commit acts of embezzlement, which, pursuant to then Code \u00a7 19.1-168, were indicted as three counts covering three different six-month periods. <em>Id. </em>at 772. He contended, in a <em>habeas corpus </em>proceeding, that, because the indictments \u201ccarve[d] out three crimes in an allegedly arbitrary manner when in fact, only one continuing criminal transaction was in issue,\u201d the separate counts violated due process. <em>Id. </em>The district court rejected that argument, opining, \u201c[t]he thrust of [Code \u00a7 19.1-168], therefore, is to allow joinder under one charge of separate crimes committed within the specified period where said joinder, absent statutory authority, possibly might run afoul of the rule of duplicity of charges. The rule of duplicity prohibits the simultaneous charging of several unrelated crimes in one indictment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court indicated the prosecution could have indicted the defendant on 204 separate counts, \u201cseeking to prove each separately.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">Clearly, Code \u00a7 19.2-223, which appellant argues supports his position, simply allows the Commonwealth to join distinct charges into one indictment, which can cover a six-month period. The statute does not create any presumption that embezzlement is a continuing crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">Appellant also asks us to consider <em>Millard, </em>34 Va.App. 202, 539 S.E.2d 84. However, this case does not support appellant\u2019s position. Millard was charged with three separate counts of obtaining money by false pretenses for presenting three checks payable to Craig Funk, and further endorsed by \u201cJennifer Funk,\u201d and then representing herself as \u201cJennifer Funk.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 204, 539 S.E.2d at 85. The checks were presented to the bank in one transaction, and Millard received \u201cone lump sum.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This Court reversed the three convictions under the single larceny doctrine. The Court found only one transaction had occurred; therefore, only a \u201csingle impulse\u201d could be proved. <em>Id. </em>at 207, 539 S.E.2d at 86. Thus, <em>Millard </em>is distinguishable on its facts as appellant here does not argue the acts of embezzlement all occurred on the same day nor that he received the money in \u201cone lump sum.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>We conclude the evidence supports the trial court\u2019s finding that appellant entertained a separate and distinct intent to commit the various acts of embezzlement. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b659-10\">. Appellant entered a conditional plea of guilty, pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-254, with the Commonwealth\u2019s consent, preserving this issue for appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b659-11\">. Although appellant testified in support of his motion to consolidate the indictments, the trial court did not hear any additional evidence. Instead, given appellant\u2019s guilty plea, the Commonwealth filed a \"Stipulation of Commonwealth\u2019s Evidence,\u201d signed by appellant and his attorney, at the time of trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b661-10\">. We do not address nor do we decide whether embezzlement is an offense subject to a single larceny doctrine analysis. At the hearing on the motion to merge, both counsel made their arguments assuming that the doctrine would apply if the evidence proved the acts resulted from a \"single impulse.\u201d The trial court found the acts of embezzlement were numerous \"individual impulses.\u201d As the Commonwealth at trial essentially conceded the single larceny doctrine can apply to embezzlement cases and concedes on appeal that we \"need not decide\u201d whether this doctrine applies generally to resolve this case, we will not consider whether Virginia law should allow the doctrine to apply to charges of embezzlement. <em>See Garcia v. Commonwealth, </em>40 Va.App. 184, 192 n. 2, 578 S.E.2d 97, 100 n. 2 (2003) (noting <em>dicta </em>includes holdings that were unnecessary to the appellate court\u2019s decision and, therefore, are not binding on subsequent appellate decisions).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b663-7\">. Appellant conceded at oral argument that embezzlement could give rise to multiple counts, depending on the facts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b663-8\">. The indictments set forth the following dates for the five offenses: December 8, 1999 through May 15, 2000; May 18, 2000 through October 11, 2000; October 17, 2000 through April 5, 2001; April 10, 2001 through September 6, 2001; September 11, 2001 through January 7, 2002.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b663-9\">. We note that some of the factors cannot be discussed here. For example, no tangible property was stolen, so the \"location\u201d of the stolen \"items\u201d cannot be addressed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b666-6\">BENTON, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AQy\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">At trial, David Bragg\u2019s attorney made a motion to merge the five specified acts of embezzlement alleged in the indictment into one count of embezzlement. She argued that the single larceny doctrine applied and that the indictment was drawn upon \u201ca single plan of embezzlement\u201d occurring in a continuous fashion. The prosecutor argued \u201cthat the statute [Code \u00a7 ] 19.2-223 gives [the Commonwealth] the leeway\u201d to charge one embezzlement, five embezzlements, or \u201cthe option ... to charge in this case 142 counts.\u201d I would hold that the trial judge erred in not granting Bragg\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-9\">The indictment in this case charged one general embezzlement. In particular, it alleged the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-10\">The Special Grand Jurors of the Commonwealth of Virginia and of the City of Virginia Beach, attending the Court aforesaid, upon their oaths present that, in the City of Virginia Beach,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-11\">\n<em>DAVID GORDON BRAGG</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-12\">Did wrongfully and fraudulently use, dispose of, conceal, or embezzle monies in excess of $82,000.00, belonging to St. Andrews United Methodist Church, and did wrongfully and fraudulently use said monies for, among other purposes known and unknown to the Special Grand Jury, payments to a mortgage company, a homeowners association, a wireless communications service provider, and a credit company.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-13\">1.

Beginning December 8, 1999 and continuing through January 7, 2002, Bragg fraudulently appropriated $82,130.40 from the church\u2019s account by writing 142 checks. The parties also stipulated the following facts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-21\">Bragg used church funds to pay the mortgage on his home ..., to pay his cell phone account ..., to pay off a loan he had obtained from AmeriCredit, and his Green Run Home<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>owners\u2019 Association dues, as examples. On several occasions he also made checks payable directly to himself and marked them \u201cpayroll,\u201d even though, as indicated earlier, he was a volunteer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-5\">... [Bragg] advised Detective Werle ... that he had in fact embezzled money from the church admitting that he had used it to pay his mortgage, his cell phone bill, a car loan and other expenses. He further admitted that many of the checks from the church were deposited into his personal account....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">In addition, Bragg testified that he began embezzling the church\u2019s money when his income from his employment dropped by $30,000 and he began to have financial difficulty. He used his position as treasurer of the church to embezzle the church\u2019s funds to pay his bills and support his lifestyle. Bragg conceded that the evidence proved embezzlement. He contends, however, that the evidence proved but one embezzlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-8\">Embezzlement is a statutory crime in Virginia, <em>Moss v. Harwood, </em>102 Va. 386, 389, 46 S.E. 385, 386 (1904), and it \u201cwas devised by legislatures to address an inadequacy in the common law of larceny.\u201d <em>Gwaltney v. Commonwealth, </em>19 Va.App. 468, 474, 452 S.E.2d 687, 690-91 (1995). At all times alleged in the indictment, the embezzlement statute provided as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-9\">If any person wrongfully and fraudulently use, dispose of, conceal or embezzle any money, bill, note, check, order, draft, bond, receipt, bill of lading or any other personal property, tangible or intangible, which he shall have received for another or for his employer, principal or bailor, or by virtue of his office, trust, or employment, or which shall have been entrusted or delivered to him by another or by any court, corporation or company, he shall be guilty of embezzlement. Embezzlement shall be deemed larceny and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>upon conviction thereof, the person shall be punished as provided in [Code] \u00a7 18.2-95 or [Code] \u00a7 18.2-96.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">Code \u00a7 18.2-111.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">The statute penalizes a course of conduct. It does not suggest that each individual act within that course of conduct may be charged as a separate offense <em>ad infinitum. </em>Thus, the Supreme Court of Virginia has recognized \u201cthat an indictment charging an accused with embezzling money over a period of more than three years, stating the aggregate amount of such various sums, charges a continuous plan or scheme and a single offense of embezzlement.\u201d <em>Webb v. Commonwealth, </em>204 Va. 24, 32, 129 S.E.2d 22, 28 (1963). Indeed, the principle is well established that when a person embezzles by several acts or instances of defalcations the mere passage of time does not convert the single offense of embezzlement into several distinct offenses. <em>See State v. Gordon, </em>146 Kan. 41, 68 P.2d 635, 639 (1937). Those several acts merely represent a step or stage of the same offense, <em>id., </em>and can be charged in one count without regard to the period of time over which the acts occurred. <em>Webb, </em>204 Va. at 32, 129 S.E.2d at 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">The Commonwealth argues that Code \u00a7 19.2-223 supports its contention that it can indict separately for any number of distinct acts that may constitute embezzlement, thus it could have indicted Bragg separately for each of the 142 checks. In pertinent part, Code \u00a7 19.2-223 provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-8\">In a prosecution against a person accused of embezzling or fraudulently converting to his own use bullion, money, bank notes or other security for money or items of personal property subject to larceny it shall be lawful in the same indictment or accusation to charge and thereon to proceed against the accused for any number of distinct acts of such embezzlements or fraudulent conversions which may have been committed by him within six months from the first to the last of the acts charged in the indictment....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b669-9\">This statute does no more than permit the Commonwealth to charge and proceed upon \u201cany number of distinct acts\u201d occurring within a six-month period as the basis for an embez<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>zlement charge. The effect of this statute is to treat such acts as \u201crelated\u201d and to statutorily prevent a claim that an indictment was defective under the rule prohibiting duplicity and misjoinder of charges in one indictment. <em>See, e.g., Pettus v. Peyton, </em>207 Va. 906, 910, 153 S.E.2d 278, 281 (1967); <em>Dean v. Commonwealth, </em>189 Va. 426, 432, 53 S.E.2d 141, 144 (1949); <em>Federal Land Bank v. Birchfield, </em>173 Va. 200, 212-14, 3 S.E.2d 405, 409-10 (1939). <em>See also Abney v. United States, </em>431 U.S. 651, 663-64, 97 S.Ct. 2034, 2042, 52 L.Ed.2d 651 (1977); <em>United States v. Burns, </em>990 F.2d 1426, 1438 (4th Cir.1993); <em>United States v. Hawkes, </em>753 F.2d 355, 357 (4th Cir.1985); <em>United States v. Stanley, </em>597 F.2d 866, 871 (4th Cir.1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">Interpreting the words \u201cdistinct acts of such embezzlement,\u201d the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia long ago held that an indictment charging the entire amount of the embezzlement and specifying \u201ca series of peculations by the cashier of the bank, extending over a period of three years,\u201d denoted those peculations as incidents of continuing transactions but \u201ccharged ... a single act of embezzlement.\u201d <em>State v. Wetzel, </em>75 W.Va. 7, 83 S.E. 68, 72-73 (1914). Our Supreme Court noted in <em>Webb </em>that the language found in the West Virginia statute \u201cis practically the same as that of our statute,\u201d and the Court relied on the <em>Wetzel </em>interpretation in holding that embezzlement beginning January 1956 and continuing through February 1959 was \u201cpart of a continuous plan or scheme ... so as to constitute a single offense.\u201d <em>Webb, </em>204 Va. at 32, 129 S.E.2d at 28. This interpretation of the statute merely established a rule in Virginia that existed long ago in other jurisdictions. <em>See, e.g., Gordon, </em>68 P.2d at 639 (holding that \u201c[a]n information charging that the accused on the fifteenth day of August, 1900, and on divers dates and days from thence continuously to the tenth day of January, 1901, did then and there convert to his own use certain moneys amounting in the aggregate to a named sum, is not defective for duplicity, but charges one continuous offense\u201d). It has long been the view in other states that an indictment charges one general crime of embezzlement when it recites a general <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>allegation of embezzlement and specifies several counts showing the various ways in which the general crime was committed. <em>See, e.g., State v. Bickford, </em>28 N.D. 36, 147 N.W. 407, 414 (1913). Put simply, such an indictment alleges \u201cvarious facts by which the common and necessary fact, that is to say, the substantive crime of embezzlement, was committed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 415. <em>See also Wiley v. State, </em>349 P.2d 30, 37 (Okla.Cr.App.1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">After reciting the fact of Bragg\u2019s embezzlement of $82,000 from the church, the indictments list five specific time periods in which Bragg embezzled amounts exceeding $200 or more for a total of $82,000: December 8, 1999 through May 15, 2000; May 18, 2000 through October 11, 2000; October 17, 2000 through April 5, 2001; April 10, 2001 through September 6, 2001; and September 11, 2001 through January 7, 2002. The record does not indicate that these five discrete time periods correlate to any transactions or acts that were of a separate or particular nature. The evidence contains no suggestion of events other than Bragg\u2019s continuous appropriation of the church\u2019s money by the writing of checks. Indeed, the trial judge found that Bragg\u2019s \u201ctestimony really is fairly unequivocal in that he was doing this as the need arose\u201d and that the pattern of check writing \u201cseems to be consistent with exactly what he said.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">In ruling that the evidence proved several embezzlements, the trial judge improperly focused upon the purpose for which Bragg used the funds rather than Bragg\u2019s intent, the continuity of his intent, and the continuous nature of his defalcations. Noting that Bragg used the money for mortgage payments, utilities, groceries, trips, expenses incurred by others, and other discretionary spending, the trial judge found that no regular pattern existed to the use of the funds and, thus, attributed the appropriations to \u201cindividual impulses.\u201d However, the multiple purposes for which Bragg used the embezzled funds after they went into his account cannot rationally be the basis for determining the unit of prosecution for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>embezzlement. The statute renders irrelevant the purpose for which the embezzler uses the money. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-111 (unlawful to \u201cwrongfully and fraudulently use, dispose of, conceal or embezzle ... any ... personal property, tangible or intangible, ... received ... by virtue of ... office trust, or employment ... \u201d) In other words, \u201cthe crime of embezzlement depends upon the existence of a fraudulent intent in the mind of the person by whom the money or property is alleged to have been converted.\u201d <em>Page v. Commonwealth, </em>148 Va. 733, 741-42, 138 S.E. 510, 512 (1927). <em>See also Webb, </em>204 Va. at 34, 129 S.E.2d at 30 (holding that \u201cit is necessary to prove that an accused wrongfully appropriated to his own use or benefit, with the intent to deprive the owner thereof, the property of another which has been entrusted to him by reason of his employment or office\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">The evidence established that Bragg acted upon the impulse to appropriate the church\u2019s money after his salary from his employment dropped by $30,000. This event led to a continuous and regular fraudulent scheme of writing checks from the church\u2019s bank account for his use and benefit. <em>See Challenor v. Commonwealth, </em>209 Va. 789, 792, 167 S.E.2d 116, 118 (1969) (holding that embezzling $21,139.33 within a thirty-month period by an employee from the accounts of his employer was a single offense of embezzlement). As the Appendix to this opinion demonstrates, Bragg wrote checks each month over the entire period of twenty-six months, beginning December 1999 and continuing through January 2002. Neither the pattern of appropriations nor any other evidence demonstrates that a change occurred in Bragg\u2019s intent or impulse. The evidence clearly established that Bragg engaged in a continuous theft of funds from the church.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b673-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>The Commonwealth established no event or intent that separates these appropriations into five distinct embezzlements as listed in the indictment: December 8, 1999 to May 15, 2000; May 18, 2000 to October 11, 2000; October 17, 2000 to April 5, 2001; April 10, 2001 to September 6, 2001; and September 11, 2001 to January 7, 2002. These segments merely were chosen under the misapprehension that six-month intervals were determined by Code \u00a7 19.2-223. Otherwise, the intervals bear no relation to Bragg\u2019s impulses, intent, or other events of the case. The evidence proved he had a continuing intention and impulse to appropriate the church\u2019s money. Indeed, the continuous and uninterrupted frequency at which Bragg appropriated these funds manifestly negates any notion that these acts of appropriation, which he committed almost weekly, were the product of individual impulses. No evidence tended to establish that Bragg\u2019s intent to wrongfully appropriate the funds was not a continuous impulse. Thus, I would hold that the indictment charged and the evidence proved \u201c \u2018a continuous plan or scheme and a single offense of embezzlement.\u2019\u201d <em>Challenor, </em>209 Va. at 792, 167 S.E.2d at 118 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">The Supreme Court has described the single larceny doctrine as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-6\">[A] series of larcenous acts, regardless of the amount and value of the separate parcels or articles taken, and regardless of the time occupied in the performance, may and will constitute, in contemplation of law, a single larceny, provid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>ed the several acts are done pursuant to a single impulse and in execution of a general fraudulent scheme.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b674-5\"><em>West v. Commonwealth, </em>125 Va. 747, 754-55, 99 S.E. 654, 656 (1919). We have previously applied the single larceny doctrine to the statutory offense of obtaining money by false pretenses. <em>Millard v. Commonwealth, </em>34 Va.App. 202, 206, 539 S.E.2d 84, 86 (2000). In my view, the same rationale for extending the principle to cases of defalcations by false pretenses applies to embezzlements. Other states have applied the single larceny doctrine to embezzlement cases. <em>See, e.g., State v. Roberts, </em>210 Kan. 786, 504 P.2d 242, 246 (1972) (holding that the \u201csingle larceny doctrine\u201d applies in embezzlement and other larceny cases); <em>State v. Pedroncelli, </em>100 N.M. 678, 675 P.2d 127, 129-30 (1984) (holding that the single larceny principle applies in embezzlement cases when \u201cevidence ... sufficiently showed [defendant\u2019s] continuing intention to violate her ongoing entrustment\u201d); <em>Nelson v. State, </em>208 Tenn. 179, 344 S.W.2d 540, 542 (1960) (holding that successive takings constitute one embezzlement when the evidence proved \u201ca common and continuing design and scheme to fraudulently appropriate the funds\u201d). The facts recited in Parts I and III above constitute, in contemplation of law, a single embezzlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">For these reasons, I would hold that the indictment alleged one embezzlement of money in excess of $82,000 and that the five intervals listed on the indictment are representative of transactions establishing the one offense. Alternatively, I would apply the \u201csingle larceny\u201d doctrine and hold that the indictment and the proof establish only one embezzlement. For these reasons, I would vacate four of the embezzlement convictions, affirm one conviction, and remand for reconsideration of the sentence.</p>\n<p
