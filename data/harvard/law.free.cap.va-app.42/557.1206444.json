First, he contends we should draw a distinction between consent decrees signed by counsel and those signed by their clients. Only the latter type, he argues, should be immune from judicial modification and termination under Code \u00a7 20-109(C). Second, he asserts that, whether properly signed or not, the consent decree in this case included language authorizing modification or termination by the courts. Disagreeing with both propositions, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-9\">This proceeding began when Paul David Newman filed a bill of complaint seeking to divorce his wife, Ellen Renee Newman. The bill of complaint also requested rulings regarding child support, custody and visitation of their children, and distribution of marital property. Wife filed a cross-bill seeking spousal support and other relief. While the suit was pending, the parties entered into a written agreement settling all equitable distribution issues and requested that the trial court incorporate that settlement into its final order.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-10\">The trial court took evidence on the remaining issues in the case and entered a final decree <em>nunc pro tunc </em>on May 25, 2001. The decree awarded custody of the children to wife and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>granted her child support. The court also awarded $1,200 per month in \u201cPermanent Spousal Support\u201d to wife. Husband\u2019s counsel objected to the final decree, contesting the \u201camount of spousal support and the determination of the [husband\u2019s] gross income.\u201d Neither party appealed the final decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">In July 2001, husband filed a \u201cMotion to Amend Spousal Support and Child Support.\u201d He argued that a \u201cmaterial change in financial circumstances\u201d made a \u201cdecrease in spousal support appropriate.\u201d Child support, he further contended, \u201cshould be recalculated after an award of spousal support is established.\u201d The wife contested the putative change in circumstances and asked that the support remain at the amount previously ordered by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">On August 31, 2001, husband and wife advised the trial court that they had settled their spousal support dispute. The parties presented to the trial judge an agreed order stating, in its first sentence, that they appeared \u201cby counsel\u201d and that \u201call matters in dispute are settled and agreed.\u201d The consent decree reduced the permanent spousal support award to $1,000 per month and likewise adjusted the child support obligation. Both obligations, they agreed, would be \u201ccontinuing as provided in Virginia Code \u00a7\u00a7 16.1-278.15 and 20-109.\u201d The decree also provided for a lump sum payment, on February 15 of each year, in additional spousal and child support in the event husband\u2019s gross yearly earnings exceeded $65,000. Husband\u2019s counsel signed the order under the legend \u201cI ask for this.\u201d The signature of wife\u2019s counsel appeared below the notation \u201cSeen and Agreed.\u201d Counsel for both parties signed the agreed award on behalf of their respective clients. The trial court entered the consent order on September 12, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">Less than five months later, on February 5, 2002, husband filed a \u201cMotion to Eliminate and/or Reduce Spousal Support.\u201d He conceded that the earlier consent decree represented a negotiated settlement of the dispute over permanent spousal support. Even so, he argued, the agreement could be judicially terminated or modified because (i) it was signed by counsel on behalf of their clients, rather than by the clients them<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>selves, and (ii) it included an express provision contractually authorizing judicial termination or modification. Wife disputed both claims, contending the consent decree was an \u201cagreement\u201d in the nature of a \u201cstipulation signed by counsel\u201d in compliance with Code \u00a7 20-109(0 and \u201cclearly not modifiable under the terms contained therein.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">The trial judge rejected husband\u2019s motion, finding that the consent decree was \u201ca stipulation that was entered into and reduced to the form of an order by the parties.\u201d The attorneys signed the decree on their clients\u2019 behalf. \u201cThis is not the court\u2019s order,\u201d the judge explained, \u201cthis is the parties\u2019 order.\u201d And because it was an \u201cagreement between the parties,\u201d the judge held, it could not be terminated or modified except pursuant to its contractual terms. Nothing in the consent decree provided either party with such a right. For these reasons, the trial court denied husband\u2019s \u201cMotion to Eliminate and/or Reduce Spousal Support.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">The underlying principle at issue in this appeal can be simply stated: \u201cCode \u00a7 20-109(A) empowers trial courts to modify a spousal support award, but Code \u00a7 20-109(C) expressly limits the court\u2019s authority to modify an agreed upon spousal support award according to the terms of a stipulation or contract signed by the parties.\u201d <em>Blackburn v. Michael, </em>30 Va.App. 95, 100, 515 S.E.2d 780, 783 (1999). This case requires us to decide whether an agreement setting the amount of spousal support \u2014 embodied in a consent decree signed by counsel on behalf of their respective clients \u2014 qualifies as a stipulation or contract under Code \u00a7 20-109(C) for purposes of giving it the one critical quality that most legally binding agreements ordinarily have: They cannot be rewritten by the courts. For the following reasons, we hold that it does.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-8\">A. <em>The Consent Decree Was A \u201cStipulation or Contract. </em>\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b612-9\">The trial judge held that the consent decree was not only an \u201cagreement between the parties,\u201d but one that rose to the level of a <em>\u201cstipulation </em>that was entered into and reduced to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>the form of an order by the parties.\u201d (Emphasis added). The trial judge\u2019s characterization of the consent decree rests on the widely accepted proposition that a stipulation is \u201can agreement between counsel respecting business before a court.\u201d <em>Burke v. Gale, </em>193 Va. 130, 137, 67 S.E.2d 917, 920 (1951) (quoting <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1660 (3d ed. 1933) (\u201cStipulation\u201d)); <em>see also Lane v. Lane, </em>32 Va.App. 125, 129, 526 S.E.2d 773, 775 (2000); <em>Orlandi v. Orlandi, </em>23 Va.App. 21, 26, 473 S.E.2d 716, 719 (1996) (recognizing that a \u201cconsent decree is a contract or agreement between the parties to the suit, entered of record in the cause with the consent of the court, and is binding\u201d); <em>Durrett v. Durrett, </em>204 Va. 59, 63, 129 S.E.2d 50, 53 (1963) (same); <em>Barnes v. Am. Fertilizer Co., </em>144 Va. 692, 720, 130 S.E. 902, 911 (1925) (same); <em>see generally Restatement (Second) of Contracts: Stipulations </em>\u00a7 94 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">It was exactly this understanding of \u201cstipulation\u201d that we adopted in <em>Lane </em>for purposes of interpreting Code \u00a7 20-109(C). <em>Lane, </em>32 Va.App. at 129, 526 S.E.2d at 775. It stems from the observation that, with consent decrees, the parties obviously reach their \u201cagreement before the decree\u201d and thus \u201cthe decree merely formalize[s] the obligations already assumed.\u201d <em>Schmidt v. Schmidt, </em>6 Va.App. 501, 505, 370 S.E.2d 311, 313 (1988). Under Code \u00a7 20-109.1, a trial court may \u201cincorporate\u201d by reference contractual provisions into any decree either before or after the entry of a final order. All the more, a trial court may incorporate verbatim the terms of an agreement into the very text of a consent decree. The trial court, therefore, did not err in holding that the consent decree constitutes a \u201cstipulation or contract\u201d under Code \u00a7 20-109(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">B. <em>The \u201cStipulation or Contract\u201d Was Signed By The Parties Through Their Attorneys Acting With Actual Authority.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">Code \u00a7 20-109(C) requires that the \u201cparty to whom such relief might otherwise be awarded\u201d sign the stipulation or contract. In this case, husband concedes that both attorneys, acting with actual authority, signed the consent decree on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>their respective clients\u2019 behalf. During oral argument before us, husband\u2019s counsel made plain that he has \u201cnever contested\u201d either attorney\u2019s authority to sign the consent decree in that representative capacity. There can be no question, therefore, that counsel signed the decree as authorized agents acting on behalf of their principals.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">Husband nevertheless claims that we should make a distinction between consent decrees signed by attorneys on their clients\u2019 behalf and those signed by the clients personally. Relying on <em>Lane, </em>husband asserts that Code \u00a7 20-109(C) codified this distinction. <em>See Lane, </em>32 Va.App. at 129, 526 S.E.2d at 775 (stating that a consent decree signed by both counsel on behalf of their clients was a decree \u201csigned by neither party\u201d). We disagree for two reasons. First, we view <em>Lane\u2019s </em>endorsement of that distinction as <em>dicta </em>having no <em>stare decisis </em>weight. Second, the <em>Lane </em>distinction requires an interpretation of the signature requirement in conflict with settled principles of statutory construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">(i). <em>Stare Decisis Does Not Apply To The Lane Dicta.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">A closer look at the actual holding in <em>Lane </em>demonstrates that its language about who has to sign the decree is <em>dicta. </em>In <em>Lane, </em>the parties entered into a spousal support agreement memorialized in a final divorce decree entered in 1988. Counsel for the parties signed the agreed decree, but their clients did not. In 1989, the parties entered into a \u201csubsequent agreement\u201d and submitted a new consent order memorializing it. <em>Lane, </em>32 Va.App. at 128, 526 S.E.2d at 775. This time, however, the wife personally endorsed the order. After the trial court entered the consent order, it became the \u201cgoverning agreement between the parties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 130, 526 S.E.2d at 776.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-8\">Eight years later, in 1997, the husband in <em>Lane </em>filed a petition under Code \u00a7 20-109 to modify or terminate his support obligation due to changed circumstances. The trial court stated that it had the authority to modify or terminate support, but declined to exercise that authority because the evidence did not prove that circumstances had changed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>enough to support the petition. Both the wife and husband appealed: the wife complained about the trial court\u2019s reasoning, the husband about the court\u2019s result.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\"><em>Lane </em>held that the trial court reached the right result, but for the wrong reason. The right reason, <em>Lane </em>explained, was that with or without changed circumstances, Code \u00a7 20-109(C) forbids modification or termination of support unless consistent with the parties\u2019 agreement. The \u201cgoverning agreement\u201d was the 1989 consent order signed personally by the wife as the payee party. <em>Id. </em>at 130, 526 S.E.2d at 776. And it did not authorize modification or termination under the circumstances alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">In the course of the opinion, however, <em>Lane </em>also addressed whether the original divorce decree entered in 1988 satisfied Code \u00a7 20-109(C). <em>Id. </em>at 129, 526 S.E.2d at 775 (referencing former \u00a7 20-109(B), which contained the requirements now found in \u00a7 20-109(0). <em>Lane </em>opined that the original 1988 decree violated Code \u00a7 20-109(0 because the parties\u2019 counsel, not the parties themselves, signed it. Neither the holding nor the <em>ratio decidendi </em>of <em>Lane </em>required any examination of whether the earlier agreement memorialized in the 1988 decree \u2014 the non-governing agreement superceded by the 1989 consent order \u2014 complied with the signature requirement of Code \u00a7 20-109(C). It made no difference whether it did or not. Whether the wife\u2019s lawyer could sign the 1988 decree as an agent on her behalf was irrelevant because the wife personally signed the 1989 consent order.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\"><em>Stare decisis </em>cannot be properly applied without \u201cthe need to distinguish an opinion\u2019s holding from its <em>dicta.\u201d United States Nat\u2019l Bank of Ore. v. Indep. Ins. Agents of Am., Inc., </em>508 U.S. 439, 463 n. 11, 113 S.Ct. 2173, 2186 n.11, 124 L.Ed.2d 402 (1993). <em>Dicta </em>in a prior decision generally refers to that portion of an opinion \u201cnot essential\u201d to the disposition in the case. <em>Cent.

Ry. &amp; Power Co. v. Dressier, </em>132 Va. 342, 350-51, 111 S.E. 243, 245-46 (1922) (Burks, J.) (quoting <em>Cohens v. Virginia, </em>19 U.S. (6 Wheat.) 264, 399, 5 L.Ed. 257 (1821) (Marshall, C.J.)). <em>Dicta </em>cannot \u201cserve as a source of binding authority in American jurisprudence.\u201d <em>United States v.

St. Mary\u2019s Hosp., Inc., </em>266 Va. 472, 476, 587 S.E.2d 567, 569 (2003); <em>Patten v. Commonwealth, </em>262 Va. 654, 658, 553 S.E.2d 517, 519 (2001); <em>Melanson v. Commonwealth, </em>261 Va. 178, 181, 539 S.E.2d 433, 434 (2001). \u201cAbrogation of the common law requires that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>General Assembly plainly manifest an intent to do so.\u201d <em>Linhart v. Lawson, </em>261 Va. 30, 35, 540 S.E.2d 875, 877 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">Under the common law of agency, the signature of a disclosed, authorized agent has the same legal force as the signature of his principal. Unless the facts show otherwise, a contractual instrument should be \u201cinterpreted as the instrument of the principal and not of the agent if, in the signature or description of the parties, the name of the principal and agent both appear, the agent indicating his agency.\u201d <em>Restatement (Second) of Agency </em>\u00a7 156 (1958). Consequently, \u201c[a]ny' signature or description from which it appears that the parties intend that the principal and not the agent shall be a party is efficacious in creating an inference that the principal is a party.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 156 cmt. a; <em>see also </em>E. Allan Farnsworth, 2 <em>Farnsworth on Contracts </em>\u00a7 6.8 (2d ed.2001) (recognizing that a \u201cparty\u2019s signature may be made by an agent\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">Common law agency principles apply to the attorney-client relationship. <em>See, e.g., Va. Elec. &amp; Power Co. v. Bowers, </em>181 Va. 542, 547, 25 S.E.2d 361, 363 (1943) (noting that \u201can attorney is the agent of his client\u201d); <em>cf. Walson v. Walson, </em>37 Va.App. 208, 214-16, 556 S.E.2d 53, 56-57 (2001) (discussing common law agency principles, specifically those distinguishing actual from apparent authority, in the context of an attorney-client relationship). To be sime, in various contexts (Rule 5A:18 waivers, open-court stipulations, proffers from counsel, to name a few), we often treat an attorney as legally synonymous with his or her client. Any other view would be \u201cwholly inconsistent with our system of representative litigation,\u201d <em>Link v. Wabash R.R. Co., </em>370 U.S. 626, 634, 82 S.Ct. 1386, 1390, 8 L.Ed.2d 734 (1962), in which an attorney serves as an \u201cagent when acting, or failing to act, in furtherance of the litigation,\u201d <em>Coleman v. Thompson, </em>501 U.S. 722, 753, 111 S.Ct. 2546, 2567, 115 L.Ed.2d 640 (1991) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">Nothing in Code \u00a7 20-109(C) displaces these common law principles. The statutory requirement that the parties sign the agreement does not, either linguistically or legally, exclude them from doing so through their attorneys. The very use of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>the term \u201cstipulation\u201d implies that counsel may sign on their clients\u2019 behalf. While it could involve an agreement between <em>pro se </em>parties, more often than not a \u201cstipulation contemplates \u2018an <em>agreement between counsel </em>respecting business before a court.\u2019 \u201d <em>Burke, </em>193 Va. at 137, 67 S.E.2d at 920 (citation omitted and emphasis added); <em>see also Lane, </em>32 Va.App. at 129, 526 S.E.2d at 775.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">Moreover, subsections A and B of \u00a7 20-109 authorize either \u201cparty\u201d to file modification petitions in court. Under husband\u2019s interpretation, this would exclude the party\u2019s counsel from performing this task on behalf of the client \u2014 a near universal practice in our courts. Such an interpretation would hardly be in keeping with the longstanding principle that \u201cwhen the same word is used in different parts of the same statute, the presumption is that it was used in the same sense throughout the statute, unless a contrary intention clearly appears.\u201d <em>Bridgewater Mfg. Co. v. Funkhouser, </em>115 Va. 476, 480, 79 S.E. 1074, 1076 (1913); <em>see also Bd. of Supervisors of Albemarle County v.

Code \u00a7 20-109(C). \u201cThis provision of Code \u00a7 20-109,\u201d the Virginia Supreme Court has often explained, \u201cinhibits the power of the court to award or consider modification of the decree to the extent that spousal support and maintenance are provided for in the incorporated agreement of the parties.\u201d <em>White v.

In such cases, the stipulation or contract must expressly <em>preclude </em>termination of the contractual duty of spousal support on these grounds. If it fails to do so, the contractual obligation may be terminated. <em>See Hardesty v. Hardesty, </em>40 Va.App. 663, 581 S.E.2d 213 (2003) <em>(en </em>banc). For all other possible grounds, however, the burden remains on the party seeking to back out of the contractual duty of spousal support.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">In this case, husband seeks to \u201cEliminate and/or Reduce\u201d his contractual duty of spousal support on grounds other than cohabitation, remarriage, or death. As a result, he correctly acknowledges, if his agreement does not \u201cretain modifiability\u201d then \u201cby default\u201d it remains non-modifiable. Though conceding this principle, however, husband finds fault with the trial court\u2019s application of it to the consent decree. Under husband\u2019s interpretation, the consent decree expressly authorizes judicial modification and termination of the duty to pay spousal support by stating that it would be \u201ccontinuing as provided in Virginia Code \u00a7\u00a7 16.1-278.15 and 20-109.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">The trial court correctly held this clause did no such thing. The reference to Code \u00a7 16.1-278.15 deals with child support. The oblique reference to Code \u00a7 20-109 deals with spousal support, but tells us nothing other than the statute applies to the consent decree \u2014 an axiomatic proposition that, in any event, begs the question. Of course the statute applies. The question is whether the contracting parties intended this phrase to strip the consent decree of its contractual character, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>giving it the status of a mere contested decree subject to being judicially changed or vacated over the objection of one of the parties. The answer to that question must be no. A cryptic reference to Code \u00a7 20-109 does not tell us whether the consent decree was to remain a contract immune from modification under subsection C or to become a mere order subject to modification under subsection A.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">The Virginia Supreme Court dealt with an analogous situation in <em>McLoughlin v. McLoughlin, </em>211 Va. 365, 367, 177 S.E.2d 781, 782 (1970). There, the parties entered into a settlement agreement expressly \u201cin accordance with Title 20, paragraph 109, of the Code of Virginia of 1950, as amended.\u201d The trial court merged this agreement into a consent decree and made \u201cevery part thereof incorporated and made a part of this decree by this reference.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 366, 177 S.E.2d at 782. Refusing the husband\u2019s later request that the support be terminated, the Supreme Court held that the reference to Code \u00a7 20-109 did not authorize judicial interference with the contractual duty of support because the very statute cited included a \u201cproviso\u201d forbidding such relief \u201cexcept in accordance with\u201d the stipulation or contract. <em>McLoughlin, </em>211 Va. at 367, 177 S.E.2d at 782.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">In this case, as in <em>McLoughlin, </em>the mere mention of Code \u00a7 20-109 falls far short of demonstrating that the contracting parties intended to authorize future judicial modifications to, or outright terminations of, the contractual duty to pay spousal support. To be sure, if a simple reference to the statute were to connote anything, it would be the opposite. \u201cThe statute was enacted to require that decrees for support honor agreements made by the parties; it prevents a court from rewriting the parties\u2019 contract. It stands as a clarion pronouncement of the policy encouraging settlement by agreement.\u201d <em>Smith, </em>41 Va.App. at 751, 589 S.E.2d at 443.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">The trial court did not err in denying husband\u2019s \u201cMotion to Eliminate and/or Reduce\u201d his contractual obligation to pay spousal support.

They reached an agreement to avoid the necessity of a hearing. Furthermore, the agreement the parties reached is properly reflected by the judge\u2019s September 12, 2001 order. The issue, rather, is whether the agreement (i) was a compromise only of the issues then in dispute by an order of modification pursuant to Code \u00a7 20-109(A) and Code \u00a7 20-108 or (ii) was a final settlement of spousal support for all times pursuant to Code \u00a7 20-109(C) and a settlement of child custody issues by an order of modification pursuant to Code \u00a7 20-108. I would hold that the trial judge erred in ruling that the September 12, 2001 order, which modified the child custody and spousal support provisions of the final decree of divorce and was entered upon the request of the attorneys for the parties, renders spousal support non-modifiable.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-10\">In a case involving spousal support, the Supreme Court \u201crecognized that divorce and related matters constitute a distinct category, one not always subject to the body of jurisprudence generally applicable to common law suits and actions.\u201d <em>Reid v. Reid, </em>245 Va. 409, 413, 429 S.E.2d 208, 210 (1993). Spousal support falls within this distinct category because the court\u2019s jurisdiction to render spousal support decrees in divorce proceedings is statutory and limited. <em>Lapidus v.

When the parties have entered into a \u201cstipulation or contract,\u201d subsection C of the statute provides a limitation on a judge\u2019s statutory authorization to enter a \u201cfinal decree ... except in accordance with that stipulation or contract.\u201d <em>See Blackburn v.

This limitation is significant because Code \u00a7 20-109 also empowers trial judges to modify spousal support pursuant to subsection A when that support was previously fixed by court order and is not the result of a stipulation or contract pursuant to subsection C. In other words, the statute limits the trial judge\u2019s authority to decree support only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number><em>\u201cif a stipulation or contract signed by the party to whom such relief might otherwise be awarded is filed.\u201d </em>Code \u00a7 20-109(C) (emphasis added).

The Court has also held that \u201csince its enactment, the usual practice [under Code \u00a7 20-109 and under its predecessor \u00a7 5111] is to recite in the decree that a contract has been executed by the parties and \u2018filed with the pleadings, depositions.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wallihan v. Hughes, </em>196 Va. 117, 126, 82 S.E.2d 553, 559 (1954). Indeed, the plain language of Code \u00a7 20-109(C) makes its provisions operative only when a \u201cstipulation or contract is filed\u201d before entry of a final decree or before the trial judge modifies the final decree. By \u201cusing clear, detailed language,\u201d <em>Lapidus, </em>226 at 578, 311 S.E.2d at 788, the General Assembly manifested its purpose and signaled \u201cthe process, pleading or practice\u201d to be followed in invoking the statutory proviso. <em>McCotter, </em>149 Va. at 594, 140 S.E. at 674.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-8\">Simply put, the record reflects that prior to the judge\u2019s entry of the September 12, 2001 order, the parties filed no stipulation or contract as contemplated by Code \u00a7 20-109(C) and no party moved the judge to \u201cmodify [the final] decree to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>conform to such stipulation or contract.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Indeed, the attorneys in this case demonstrated their awareness of the mandates of Code \u00a7 20-109(C) when, prior to the entry of the final decree, they filed in the trial court a document styled \u201cAgreement between Ellen Newman and Paul Newman.\u201d The husband and wife had signed this written agreement while the suit was pending for the purpose of settling all \u201cproperty issues requiring determination by the Court.\u201d When the attorney filed this agreement in the trial court, the attorney also filed a motion requesting \u201cthe Court to file the ... written settlement agreement\u201d and to \u201caffirm, ratify and incorporate the terms of the parties\u2019 written settlement agreement into any order hereafter entered.\u201d Thus, by following the mandates of the statute, the parties unmistakenly indicated that no decree was to \u201cbe entered except in accordance with that ... contract.\u201d Code \u00a7 20-109(C). <em>See also Harris, </em>217 Va. at 681, 232 S.E.2d at 741 (holding that the limitation on the court\u2019s power to enter a decree is triggered only \u201cif a stipulation or contract ... is filed ... in a divorce case\u201d). Because the record establishes that the September 12, 2001 order was not entered upon these statutory requirements, it reflects an order of the judge entered under Code \u00a7 20-109(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">The husband presents the question \u201cwhether [his] obligation to pay spousal support to [the wife] is modifiable where the parties entered into a prior consent order providing that the spousal and child support obligations are \u2018continuing as provided in ...

He further argues that the September 12, 2001 order \u201cis not a \u2018stipulation or contract\u2019 as contemplated in [Code] \u00a7 20-109(0,\u201d noting neither he nor the wife signed the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">I believe it is reasonably clear from the argument advanced by the husband, that the use of the word \u201cconsent\u201d order in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>his statement of the issue before us is no more than the loose vernacular of the legal profession to describe an uncontested order. The September 12, 2001 order contains no indication on its face that it was a \u201cconsent\u201d order. <em>See Golderos v. Golderos, </em>169 Va. 496, 504, 194 S.E. 706, 709 (1938) (noting that consent orders must \u201cshow affirmatively on the face thereof that they were entered by consent\u201d). It is not styled \u201cconsent\u201d order, and it does not contain that word in the body of the order. In <em>Denny v. Searles, </em>150 Va. 701, 143 S.E. 484 (1928), where the parties had sought an order confirming a settlement, the Supreme Court held that a decree entered by a judge does not become a \u201cconsent\u201d decree merely because \u201c[t]he decree recited that all parties in interest desired the Court to approve the <em>release and settlement </em>\u201d and the \u201cdecree was asked for by writing on the back thereof signed by counsel for all parties in interest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 730-31, 143 S.E. at 493. In short, an order does not become a \u201cconsent\u201d order merely because the parties by their attorneys have added their agreement to the judge\u2019s adjudication. Nothing on the face of the order or in the record of this case imports verity to the notion that the September 12, 2001 order was a \u201cconsent\u201d order. Rather, it was merely the parties\u2019 agreement to the judge\u2019s adjudication of the pending issues in accordance with the submitted order. The husband says as much in his brief when he contends the parties \u201cspecifically referenced the statute affording the relief of modifiability in their <em>agreed order.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">The record clearly establishes that the September 12, 2001 order served a limited purpose. It was part of the parties\u2019 continuing effort to determine spousal and child support. Earlier in the proceeding and prior to entry of the divorce decree, the trial judge sent to the parties a letter opinion, ruling that the wife was entitled to spousal support and that the wife should have custody of the three children. The husband then filed motions to obtain custody of one child and to amend the provisions for spousal and child support. Before the trial judge acted on these motions, the wife\u2019s attorney submitted a draft of a final decree of divorce to the judge with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>the husband\u2019s objections, and the judge entered the \u201cfinal decree\u201d on July 26, 2001, <em>nunc pro tuno </em>May 25, 2001. The final decree awarded monthly spousal support to the wife in the amount of $1,200, granted the wife custody of the parties\u2019 three children, and awarded monthly child support in the amount of $1,874. The final decree contained no provisions for visitation by the husband with the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">After the trial judge signed the final decree, the husband filed another notice of hearing on his motions. In preparation for the hearing, the parties subpoenaed witnesses and filed exhibits with the trial court. The hearing, however, was postponed. As judges frequently urge, the parties and their attorneys reached a compromise concerning the disputed matters without the necessity of a hearing and a ruling by the judge on the evidence. The attorneys drafted an order that addressed in detail the contested issues of child custody, child support, and spousal support. The husband\u2019s attorney signed the order under the legend, \u201cI ask for this\u201d; the wife\u2019s attorney signed the order under the legend, \u201cSeen and agreed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">The order the trial judge entered on September 12, 2001 modified the provisions of the final decree concerning child custody, child support, and spousal support. The judge\u2019s order was merely styled, <em>\u201cORDER </em>\u201d; it was dated the day of the postponed hearing; it recited that the proceeding was \u201cupon motions filed by the [husband]\u201d; and it contained the parties\u2019 representation \u201cthat all matters in dispute are settled and agreed.\u201d It included provisions that \u201cORDERED\u201d (i) physical custody of one child to the father, (ii) continuation of the parties\u2019 joint legal custody of all three children, (iii) specific visitation schedules for the children, and (iv) monthly child support of $658 and spousal support of $1,000 \u201ccontinuing as provided in ... Code \u00a7\u00a7 16.1-278.15 and 20-109\u201d and adjusting each year in accordance with a formula contained in the order, with the proviso that any increased support \u201cbe designated 1/3 child support and 2/3 spousal support.\u201d The order contained a generalized reference to Code \u00a7 20-109, without referencing either subsection A or subsection C. Con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>taining a proviso that child and spousal support would be \u201ccontinuing as provided in ... Code \u00a7 16.1-278.15 and 20-109,\u201d the order made no material distinction between its effect on child support, which is always, modifiable regardless of the parties\u2019 agreement, <em>see Parrillo v. Parrillo, </em>1 Va.App. 226, 231, 336 S.E.2d 23, 26 (1985), and spousal support, which is modifiable according to Code \u00a7 20-109(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">By presenting the September 12, 2001 order for the trial judge\u2019s signature, the attorneys clearly indicated to the judge that the order represented an agreed adjudication of the disputed issues then pending for a hearing and decision. The order, however, does not expressly represent to do more than this. Indeed, the order\u2019s provision that spousal support is \u201ccontinuing as provided in ... Code \u00a7 20-109\u201d is inconsistent with a claim that the order invokes subsection C. Significantly, the record does not indicate either party requested, or the judge found when the order was presented, that the September 12, 2001 order was to be entered \u201cto modify [the final] decree to conform to such stipulation or contract.\u201d Code \u00a7 20-109(C). The record establishes, however, that neither party filed a document purporting to be a \u201cstipulation or contract\u201d signed by the parties before submitting the endorsed order.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Furthermore, the endorsed order does not contain at any place the word \u201cconsent.\u201d If, as the wife later orally argued to the trial judge, the court order itself is to be considered as the \u201cstipulation or contract\u201d contemplated by subsection C, it could not have served that function in this case because the order, when entered, did not clearly specify that it was to be so and it did not reference the limitations of Code \u00a7 20-109(C). To require any less would engender confusion as to whether the court order is entered pursuant to Code \u00a7 20-109(A) and (B) or pursuant to Code \u00a7 20-109(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>As the Supreme Court has recognized, public policy encourages settlement of disputes because it enhances judicial efficiency of the adjudicative process, avoids litigation costs, and reduces uncertainty in results. <em>See Morris v. Morris, </em>216 Va. 457, 459, 219 S.E.2d 864, 867 (1975) (noting that \u201cpublic policy favors prompt resolution of disputes\u201d). Settlements of disputes concerning spousal support issues that are pending before a judge for decision can take the form of an \u201cagreed\u201d order requested by the parties pursuant to Code \u00a7 20-109(A) or (B) or by stipulation or contract \u201cfiled\u201d pursuant to Code \u00a7 20-109(C). In a given case, this statutory scheme obviously would accommodate a circumstance in which the parties by their attorneys agreed to the entry of an order that expressly provides that spousal support shall not be modifiable.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Nothing in Code \u00a7 20-109 would bar the effect of an agreed order providing support shall not be modifiable. That, however, was not what occurred in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">I would hold that the record unambiguously reflects that the parties agreed to settle the disputed issues, which were then in litigation and scheduled for the August hearing, and that their attorneys presented to the judge for entry an \u201cagreed\u201d order endorsed by the attorneys reflecting a compromise to resolve the disputed issues without the necessity of an evidentiary hearing and decision by the judge. Because the order was consistent with Code \u00a7 20-109(A), the order does not reference Code \u00a7 20-109(C), and the record does not reflect that the parties satisfied the requirement of Code \u00a7 20-109(C) to move \u201cthe court [to] modify its decree to conform to [a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>filed] stipulation or contract,\u201d I would hold that the trial judge erred in ruling that the spousal support ordered by the September 12, 2001 order was not modifiable.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">Accordingly, I would reverse the judgment and remand for rehearing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b629-6\">. As the husband argues, the absence of the parties\u2019 signatures on a document is significant. The proposed order, which was signed only by the attorneys, reinforces the notion that the order was merely an agreement to the judge\u2019s adjudication of the pending issues in accordance with the submitted order.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b630-7\">. Unlike the general rule that a trial judge cannot modify a civil judgment order after twenty-one days, <em>see </em>Rule 1:1, support judgments in divorce cases are statutorily distinct because a judge has continuing authority to modify decrees for child support and spousal support upon a showing of a material change in circumstances, notwithstanding Rule 1:1. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 20-108 and 20-109(A); <em>Riggins v. O'Brien, </em>263 Va. 444, 447, 559 S.E.2d 673, 675 (2002); <em>Furr </em>v. <em>Furr, </em>13 Va.App. 479, 481, 413 S.E.2d 72, 73 (1992).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
