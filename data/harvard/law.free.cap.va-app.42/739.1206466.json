The jury recommended, and the trial court imposed, a thirty-year prison sentence after learning that Seaton had been previously convicted of rape, unlawful wounding, and robbery. Seaton appeals both his conviction and his sentence. Finding no error in either, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-7\">On appeal, we review the evidence in the \u201clight most favorable\u201d to the Commonwealth. <em>Commonwealth v. Hudson, </em>265 Va. 505, 514, 578 S.E.2d 781, 786 (2003). That principle requires us to \u201cdiscard the evidence of the accused in conflict with that of the Commonwealth, and regard as true all the credible evidence favorable to the Commonwealth and all fair inferences that may be drawn therefrom.\u201d. <em>Kelly v. Commonwealth, </em>41 Va.App. 250, 254, 584 S.E.2d 444, 446 (2003) <em>(en </em>banc) (citation omitted); see also <em>Pollino v. Commonwealth, </em>42 Va.App. 243, 245-46, 590 S.E.2d 621, 623 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b793-8\">At about lunchtime on December 28, 2001, Seaton entered the First National Exchange Bank in Roanoke wearing gloves, a hooded sweatshirt, a toboggan cap (with eyeholes cut out of it) pulled down over his face, and work pants. He walked over to one of the bank tellers, Winona Callahan, and put a paper bag on the counter in front of her. Seaton then announced: \u201cThis is a bank robbery. Give me all of your money.\u201d Callahan replied, \u201cyou\u2019ve got to be kidding.\u201d Seaton then conspicuously put one hand in his pocket, \u201cshook\u201d the bag in front of Callahan with the other hand, and warned that she \u201chad ten seconds to put the money in the bag.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b793-9\">Callahan\u2019s supervisor, Melissa Hudson, and another employee were standing nearby. They heard Seaton\u2019s threats and saw his actions. Hudson described the situation as \u201cvery intimidating.\u201d After hearing the ten-second threat, Hudson <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>was \u201cvery anxious\u201d and \u201cconcerned for Ms. Callahan\u2019s safety.\u201d Hudson and Callahan\u2019s co-worker both instructed Callahan to \u201cdo what he tells you.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">Enduring what she described as \u201cprobably the longest ten seconds of my life,\u201d Callahan began taking the money out of her top drawer and putting it into Seaton\u2019s paper bag. She had the presence of mind, however, to include banded \u201cbait\u201d money in the bills stuffed into the bag. Upon realizing what Callahan had done, Seaton \u201cgot really irritated\u201d with Callahan. He showed his anger by tearing off the bands and throwing them in Callahan\u2019s direction. In response to this escalation, Callahan put the \u201crest of the money in the bag.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">After receiving about $2,417 from Callahan, Seaton left the bank with the bag of money. A bank customer, Christopher Martin, saw Seaton leave. Martin had overheard Seaton make the this-is-a-bank-robbery announcement and issue the ten-second threat to Callahan. Once Seaton was out the door, Martin called 911 and got in his car to follow Seaton. Martin eventually lost sight of Seaton after having followed him for several blocks. Martin returned to the bank to report what he had seen and heard. That afternoon, Seaton went to a convenience store and bought $800 worth of \u201cbeer, cigarettes, porno movies, [and] money orders.\u201d The police caught up with Seaton the next evening.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-7\">The grand jurors charged Seaton with robbery under Code \u00a7 18.2-58. At trial, both the Commonwealth and Seaton asked various questions seeking to prompt the eyewitnesses to describe their reactions to the incident. Callahan declared the ten seconds following Seaton\u2019s threat to be the \u201clongest\u201d ten seconds of her life. Even so, she testified, she did not feel emotionally \u201cfrightened.\u201d Callahan also said she did not \u201cstart giving\u201d Seaton money until she received her supervisor\u2019s warning to do so. For her part, Hudson described the incident as \u201cvery intimidating.\u201d To put Callahan\u2019s frightless resolve in context, Hudson explained, you needed to know that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>Callahan is a \u201cvery outspoken individual.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">Without objection, the trial judge used a variation of the finding instruction for robbery found in the Virginia Model Jury Instructions, ch. 47, No. G47.100 (1998). Among other things, the instruction informed the jury that the Commonwealth must prove that Seaton took the money \u201cagainst the will of the owner or possessor\u201d by the use of \u201cviolence or intimidation.\u201d In a colloquy with the trial court, Seaton\u2019s counsel made clear he did not contest that Seaton committed the theft and overcame Callahan\u2019s will. \u201cWe\u2019re not contesting,\u201d he conceded, \u201cwhether this was against Ms. Callahan\u2019s will.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re not contesting,\u201d he added, \u201cthat money was taken.... \u201d What Seaton did contest was that he overcame Callahan\u2019s will by using violence or intimidation. On this narrow issue, Seaton requested an additional instruction defining \u201cviolence\u201d and \u201cintimidation\u201d using selected language lifted from <em>Bivins v. Commonwealth, </em>19 Va.App. 750, 454 S.E.2d 741 (1995). The trial judge refused the instruction, ruling that it was unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">During its deliberations, the jury sent a note to the judge asking: \u201cWho had to be afraid? Miss Callahan or anyone in the bank?\u201d With the agreement of Seaton and the Commonwealth, the judge answered: \u201cElement number 5 in instruction number 2 [addressing the violence or intimidation element] refers to Winona Callahan.\u201d The jury thereafter found Seaton guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-7\">During the sentencing phase, the Commonwealth introduced certified orders showing that Seaton had been previously convicted of rape, unlawful wounding, and robbery. Seaton objected to two orders from the Bedford Circuit Court: the first convicting him of rape, the second sentencing him on that conviction. Both orders bore the certification stamp of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>Bedford Clerk of Court, noted the volume and page number of the order book from which they were copied, and reflected the signature of the deputy clerk verifying each order as a \u201ccopy teste.\u201d Seaton did not dispute that the copies were properly \u201ccertified, attested or exemplified\u201d as exact duplicates of the original orders. Nor did he contest that, in fact, he was convicted of rape just as the orders said. The orders were nevertheless inadmissible, Seaton argued, because of the absence of the Bedford trial judge\u2019s signature.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">The trial court overruled Seaton\u2019s objection to the two Bedford orders and imposed the thirty-year prison sentence recommended by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-7\">On appeal, Seaton challenges his robbery conviction and sentence on four grounds. First, he argues that Callahan\u2019s comment that she was not \u201cfrightened\u201d necessarily precludes the jury from finding intimidation. Second, he argues that the trial judge erred by permitting Hudson to testify about her concerns over Callahan\u2019s safety and her characterization of Seaton\u2019s conduct as \u201cvery intimidating.\u201d Third, Seaton claims the trial judge improperly refused to give the proffered instruction from Bivins addressing the \u201cviolence or intimidation\u201d element. Finally, Seaton claims he should be resentenced because the trial judge erroneously admitted into evidence the two Bedford orders showing his rape conviction. Finding none of his arguments persuasive, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-8\">A. <em>Sufficiency of Evidence on Intimidation</em></p>\n<p id=\"AdB\">When addressing a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence, we \u201cpresume the judgment of the trial court to be correct\u201d and reverse only if the trial court\u2019s decision is \u201cplainly wrong or without evidence\u201d to support it. <em>Kelly, </em>41 Va.App. at 257, 584 S.E.2d at 447 (citations omitted). Practically speaking, this means a jury\u2019s decision cannot be disturbed on appeal unless no \u201crational trier of fact\u201d could have come to the conclusion it did. <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Jackson v. Virgi</em>nia, 443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 2789, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>(1979)); <em>Pease v. Commonwealth, </em>39 Va.App. 342, 355, 573 S.E.2d 272, 278 (2002) <em>(en banc) </em>(\u201cWe let the decision stand unless we conclude no rational juror could have reached that decision.\u201d), aff'd, 266 Va. 397, 588 S.E.2d 149 (2003) <em>(per curiam </em>opinion adopting reasoning of <em>en banc </em>Court of Appeals opinion).</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">Under this standard, a reviewing court does not \u201cask itself whether <em>it </em>believes that the evidence at the trial established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Jackson, </em>443 U.S. at 318-19, 99 S.Ct. at 2789 (emphasis in original and citation omitted). It asks instead whether <em>\u201cany </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Kelly, </em>41 Va.App. at 257, 584 S.E.2d at 447 (quoting <em>Jackson, </em>443 U.S. at 319, 99 S.Ct. at 2789 (emphasis in original)); <em>Crowder v. Commonwealth, </em>41 Va.App. 658, 663, 588 S.E.2d 384, 387 (2003); <em>Holmes v. Commonwealth, </em>41 Va.App. 690, 691, 589 S.E.2d 11, 11 (2003).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cThis familiar standard gives full play to the responsibility of the trier of fact fairly to resolve conflicts in the testimony, to weigh the evidence, and to draw reasonable inferences from basic facts to ultimate facts.\u201d <em>Kelly, </em>41 Va.App. at 257-58, 584 S.E.2d at 447 (quoting <em>Jackson, </em>443 U.S. at 319, 99 S.Ct. at 2789). It also ensures that we remain faithful to our duty \u201cnot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>to substitute our judgment for that of the trier of fact, even were our opinion to differ.\u201d <em>Crowder, </em>41 Va.App. at 663 n. 1, 588 S.E.2d at 387 n. 1 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">In this case, Seaton challenges the sufficiency of the evidence on a very narrow ground. He does not dispute the theft. Nor does Seaton deny that he took the money \u201cagainst Ms. Callahan\u2019s will.\u201d What he challenges on appeal is the finding that he took the money against her will through the use of \u201cintimidation.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In particular, Seaton concludes Callahan\u2019s testimony that she was not \u201cfrightened\u201d eliminates \u2014 as a matter of law \u2014 any legal basis for his conviction. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">\u201cRobbery is a common law crime against the person, which is proscribed statutorily by Code \u00a7 18.2-58.\u201d <em>Clay v. Commonwealth, </em>30 Va.App. 254, 258, 516 S.E.2d 684, 685 (1999) <em>(en </em>banc). The common law defines robbery as \u201cthe taking, with intent to steal, of the personal property of another, from his person or in his presence, against his will, by violence or intimidation.\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Jones, </em>267 Va. 284, 286, 591 S.E.2d 68, 70 (2004) (quoting <em>George v. Commonwealth, </em>242 Va. 264, 277, 411 S.E.2d 12, 20 (1991), and <em>Pierce v. Commonwealth, </em>205 Va. 528, 532, 138 S.E.2d 28, 31 (1964)); <em>see also Spencer v. Commonwealth, </em>42 Va.App. 443, 448, 592 S.E.2d 400, 402-03 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b798-7\">Seaton\u2019s argument fails because of his inexact use of similar, but not identical, terms. <em>Fright </em>is not an exact synonym of fear or intimidation, at least as used in the lexicon of the common law of robbery. As Professor LaFave ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>plains, \u201cthe word \u2018fear\u2019 in connection -with robbery does not so much mean \u2018fright\u2019 as it means \u2018apprehension\u2019; one too brave to <em>he frightened </em>may yet be apprehensive of bodily harm\u201d and, therefore, make a calculated decision to surrender money to the robber. 3 Wayne R. LaFave, <em>Substantive Criminal Law </em>\u00a7 20.3(d), at 187-88 (2d ed.2003) (emphasis added). \u201cWhen the pertinent test is cast in terms of a victim being put in \u2018fear\u2019 of injury, <em>it is not necessary that the victim be frightened; </em>it is necessary merely that he be reasonably apprehensive of injury.\u201d Charles E. Torc\u00eda, 4 <em>Whartons Criminal Law </em>462, at 21 (15th ed.1996) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">This subtle distinction, while seemingly semantic, protects a crucial aspect of the common law of robbery and can be found in some of its earliest restatements. Blackstone put it this way: \u201cYet this putting in fear does not imply, that any great degree of terror or <em>affright </em>in the party robbed is necessary to constitute a robbery: It is sufficient that so much force, or threatening by word or gesture, be used, as might create an apprehension of danger, or oblige a man to part with his property without or against his consent.\u201d 4 William Blackstone, <em>Commentaries on the Law of England </em>*242 (1769) (emphasis added and modern spelling used). In other words, a brave victim maintains her fortitude <em>despite </em>intimidation\u2014 but it is intimidation nonetheless. <em>Cf. Spencer, </em>42 Va.App. at 446, 450-51, 592 S.E.2d at 401-03 (affirming carjacking conviction, a form of robbery, even though the victim fearlessly \u201cstood her ground\u201d but nonetheless moved away from the car because of the risk of being \u201crun over\u201d); W. Clark &amp; W. Marshall, <em>A Treatise on the Law of Crimes </em>12.14, at 891 (Marian Q. Barnes ed., 7th ed. 1967) (\u201cThe fact that the victim remained calm and had no actual fear <em>as long as she did what she was told </em>does not negate a conviction for robbery.\u201d (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">Guided by these principles, we believe a rational fact-finder could find that Seaton used \u201cintimidation\u201d to obtain the money from Callahan. Seaton walked up to a bank teller and announced: \u201cThis is a bank robbery.\u201d Had it come from a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>preschooler holding his parent\u2019s hand, such a remark would be a joke at best. Coming from a grown man \u2014 with a hood over his head, gloves on his hands, a toboggan cap over his face, and an empty bag on the counter \u2014 this remark has an obviously intimidating quality. It became even more so when Seaton then put his hand in his pocket and warned Callahan that she had ten seconds to turn over the money. Any ordinary person would understand what that meant: The self-described bank robber intended to do her harm if he did not get the money by the eleventh second. <em>See </em>67 Am.Jur.2d <em>Robbery </em>115 (2003) (\u201cIntimidation is frequently found where the robber placed his hand in his pocket, giving the impression that he had a concealed weapon, and made statements implying that the teller would be hurt if he or she did not comply quickly.\u201d). It was because of this implied threat, no doubt, that Callahan looks back on this as the \u201clongest\u201d ten seconds of her life.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">The intimidation escalated as Seaton got mad and threw the bait money bands back at Callahan. She responded to that assault by putting the \u201crest of the money in the bag.\u201d Thus, even though Callahan waited until receiving Hudson\u2019s permission to give Seaton the initial bait money, there was little doubt that thereafter (that is, after Seaton lost his temper and discovered Callahan\u2019s attempt at foiling his plan) Callahan handed over the \u201crest of the money\u201d in direct response to his intimidating behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">Seaton argues that the jury\u2019s question during deliberations militates against this conclusion. We think the opposite is true. The jurors asked: \u2018Who had to be afraid? Miss Callahan or anyone in the bank?\u201d After the trial judge advised them that the violence or intimidation element of the finding instruction \u201crefers to Winona Callahan,\u201d the jury returned a guilty verdict. Because we presume the jury followed the instructions of the court, <em>Gaines v. Commonwealth, </em>39 Va.App. 562, 567, 574 S.E.2d 775, 777 (2003), and similarly presume the validity of the verdict, rather than its invalidity, <em>Crowder, </em>41 Va.App. at 662, 588 S.E.2d at 386, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>believe the jury\u2019s finding of guilt could mean one of two things.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">On the one hand, it could demonstrate that the jurors applied the commonsense distinction (inherent in the common law of robbery) between a victim\u2019s purely emotional <em>fright </em>and a victim\u2019s cool-headed apprehension that the failure to comply with the robber\u2019s demands would put her in harm\u2019s way. Intimidation can exist in either scenario. The intimidation element of the offense qualifies the \u201cagainst the will\u201d element. And there was no other plausible influence, other than Sea-ton\u2019s intimidation, pressing against Callahan\u2019s predisposed \u201cwill\u201d to safeguard her employer\u2019s money. She was not making a charitable contribution to Seaton, after all, either on her own accord or at the direction of her supervisor.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">On the other hand, the guilty verdict could mean something quite different. The jurors could have viewed Callahan\u2019s testimony as internally inconsistent. Though she claimed at trial not to have been \u201cfrightened\u201d and to have initially resolved to resist (at least until Hudson intervened), she also said the ten-second threat (punctuated by Seaton putting one hand into his pocket and shaking an empty bag with the other) was the \u201clongest\u201d ten seconds of her life. To the extent the jurors interpreted this idiom to necessarily imply fright, they had the discretion to ignore Callahan\u2019s testimony to the contrary. It is altogether possible, therefore, that the jurors dismissed Callahan\u2019s claim about not being \u201cfrightened\u201d as an after-the-fact exaggeration by a \u201cvery outspoken individual\u201d\u2014 a boast of sorts, offered from the point of view of courtroom hindsight. See generally <em>Montague v. Commonwealth, </em>40 Va.App. 430, 436, 579 S.E.2d 667, 669 (2003) (noting that a factfinder need not decide between rejecting or accepting a witness\u2019s testimony in full, but may find it credible in part and incredible in part); see also <em>Barrett v. Commonwealth, </em>231 Va. 102, 107, 341 S.E.2d 190, 193 (1986) (recognizing that jurors \u201chave the right to reject that part of the evidence believed by them to be untrue and to accept that found by them to be true\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>We cannot discern, of course, which scenario best describes what the jurors were thinking. But that does not matter for purposes of resolving this appeal. Those are the only two scenarios consistent with the presumption of correctness. And, in either one, the jurors would have been acting well within their factfinding discretion. For these reasons, we conclude that their verdict was neither plainly wrong nor without evidence to support it.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">B. <em>Admissibility of Hudson\u2019s Testimony</em></p>\n<p id=\"b802-6\">Seaton next argues that the trial judge erred in admitting Hudson\u2019s testimony about her concern for Callahan\u2019s safety and her description of Seaton\u2019s conduct as \u201cvery intimidating.\u201d We find no error in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-7\">Given the \u201cbroad discretion\u201d of a trial judge over evidentiary matters, we apply a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard of appellate review. <em>Crest v. Commonwealth, </em>40 Va.App. 165, 170, 578 S.E.2d 88, 90 (2003); <em>Jones v. Commonwealth, </em>38 Va.App. 231, 236, 563 S.E.2d 364, 366 (2002). The legal threshold for relevance is well settled: \u201cEvidence is relevant if it tends to prove or disprove, or is pertinent to, matters in issue.\u201d <em>Clay v. Commonwealth, </em>262 Va. 253, 257, 546 S.E.2d 728, 730 (2001). Every fact, however remote or insignificant, that \u201ctends to establish the probability or improbability of a fact in issue is relevant.\u201d <em>Velocity Express Mid-Atlantic v. Hugen, </em>266 Va. 188, 205, 585 S.E.2d 557, 566-67 (2003) (citations omitted). Put another way, evidence has relevance if it \u201ctends to cast any light\u201d on any material point. <em>Ricks v. Commonwealth, 39 </em>Va.App. 330, 334, 573 S.E.2d 266, 268 (2002) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b802-8\">In denying Seaton\u2019s objection to Hudson\u2019s testimony, the trial judge made clear in the jury\u2019s presence that the evidence was admissible for the \u201climited purpose\u201d of assessing the effect of Seaton\u2019s conduct on Callahan. Given this limiting instruction, we see no grounds for Seaton\u2019s complaint. An eyewitness\u2019s characterization of a criminal\u2019s conduct necessarily comes through the lens of that witness\u2019s subjective reac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>tions. By admitting this contextual evidence the trial judge did not misdirect the jury\u2019s focus to Hudson. And, even if the jurors had unwittingly adopted this focus on their own, the trial judge corrected it by instructing them during deliberations that the intimidation element of the offense \u201crefers to Winona Callahan.\u201d We thus find no abuse of discretion in the admission of Hudson\u2019s testimony.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">C. <em>Seaton\u2019s Proposed \u201cViolence or Intimidation\u2019\u2019 Instruction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">Seaton contends the trial judge erred by refusing his proffered instruction defining \u201cviolence or intimidation\u201d with language taken from <em>Bivins v. Commonwealth, </em>19 Va.App. 750, 752, 454 S.E.2d 741, 742 (1995). There, we defined violence as the \u201cphysical touching or violation of the victim\u2019s person\u201d and intimidation as the result of \u201cwords or conduct of the accused [that] exercise such domination and control over the victim as to overcome the victim\u2019s mind and overbear the victim\u2019s will, placing the victim in fear of bodily harm.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 753, 454 S.E.2d at 742.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-7\">We find no error in the trial judge\u2019s decision to refuse this proposed instruction. Virginia courts have often cautioned against lifting the \u201clanguage of a specific opinion\u201d for a jury instruction given that an appellate opinion \u201cis meant to provide a rationale for a decision \u2014 and may not translate immutably into jury instructions.\u201d <em>Va. Power v. Dungee, </em>258 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>Va. 235, 251, 520 S.E.2d 164, 173 (1999). We discourage the \u201cindiscriminate use of language from appellate opinions in a jury instruction,\u201d <em>Blondel v. Hays, </em>241 Va. 467, 474, 403 S.E.2d 340, 344 (1991), because \u201cstatements appearing i\u00f1 opinions of this court, while authority for the propositions set forth, are not necessarily proper language for jury instructions,\u201d <em>Oak Knolls Realty v. Thomas, </em>212 Va. 396, 397, 184 S.E.2d 809, 810 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">This case illustrates, as well as any other, the wisdom behind this caution. <em>Bivins </em>addressed the question whether the \u201cviolence or intimidation\u201d had to be directed against the victim personally or whether it could simply be incidental to the act of taking possession of the property stolen. Consistent with the common law, we held that the violence or intimidation must be directed against the victim. We did not decide whether the thiefs conduct, <em>had it been </em>directed against the victim, would have satisfied the \u201cviolence or intimidation\u201d element of the offense. Consequently, when we described violence as \u201cphysical touching or violation of the victim\u2019s person,\u201d <em>Bivins, </em>19 Va.App. at 752, 454 S.E.2d at 742, we meant only to point out that violence must be directed against the victim. We did not mean to imply that the violence test necessarily required some physical contact with the victim, an assertion we later expressly rejected in <em>Chappelle v. Commonwealth, </em>28 Va.App. 272, 275, 504 S.E.2d 378, 379 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">Similarly, the remark lifted from <em>Bivins </em>about intimidation stated the necessary causal connection between the robber\u2019s intimidation and the victim\u2019s decision to give up the money. But that causality had already been stated in the finding instruction used in Seaton\u2019s case. Seaton\u2019s proposed instruction also went on to describe intimidation as words or conduct \u201cplacing the victim in fear of bodily harm.\u201d In the context of the evidence they heard, however, the jurors no doubt understood that this was the particular meaning of the term being applied to this case. The prosecutor presented neither testimony nor argument on any subspecies of intimidation (e.g., extortion, fear of harm to property or to individuals other than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>the victim, threat of emotional harm, or the like) which would imply anything other than a risk of physical harm to Callahan.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The trial judge did not abuse his discretion, therefore, by not clarifying something needing no clarification.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">D. <em>Proof of Seaton\u2019s Rape Conviction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">Finally, Seaton challenges the admission of the rape conviction and sentencing orders from the Bedford Circuit Court during the sentencing phase of the trial. Seaton does not contest the fact of his conviction, or the authenticity of the Bedford orders, or that they are exact copies of the orders in the clerk\u2019s order book, or that the clerk\u2019s verifications are genuine. Rather, Seaton argues the orders are inadmissible as a matter of law under various statutes (Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1, \u00a7 17.1-123 and \u00a7 19.2-307) because the trial judge\u2019s signature nowhere appears on the orders. We find no merit in any of these arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-7\">We begin with Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1, which provides that \u201cthe Commonwealth shall present the defendant\u2019s prior criminal convictions by certified, attested or exemplified copies of the record of conviction.\u201d Under this statute, a \u201crecord of conviction\u201d can be something other than a final order signed by the trial judge. <em>Folson v. Commonwealth, </em>23 Va.App. 521, 525, 478 S.E.2d 316, 318 (1996).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Nothing in this statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>requires that the \u201crecord of conviction,\u201d if otherwise rehable, bear the signature of the sentencing judge. The Bedford order book copies satisfy Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1 because they constitute a \u201crecord of conviction\u201d and are properly \u201ccertified, attested or exemplified\u201d by the clerk.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">In this respect, Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1 parallels Code \u00a7 8.01-389(A), which also addresses the admissibility of judicial records. Code \u00a7 8.01-389(A) makes clear that the \u201crecords of any judicial proceeding and any other official records of any court of this Commonwealth shall be received as prima facie evidence provided that such records are authenticated and certified by the clerk of the court where preserved to be a true record.\u201d The Bedford orders in this case were \u201cauthenticated and certified\u201d by the clerk, and thus, do not violate Code \u00a7 8.01-389(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b806-6\">Seaton next directs us to Code \u00a7 17.1-123. This statute, however, does not deal with the general admissibility of judicial records (as does Code \u00a7 8.01-389(A)) or with the specific admissibility of such records for purposes of proving a prior conviction during the sentencing phase of a jury trial (as does Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1). Instead, Code \u00a7 17.1-123(A) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b806-7\">Orders that make up each day\u2019s proceedings that have been recorded in the order book shall be deemed authenticated when (i) the judge\u2019s signature is shown in the order, (ii) the judge\u2019s signature is shown in the order book, or (in) an order is recorded in the order book on the last day of each term showing the signature of each judge presiding during the term.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b806-8\">No Virginia court has held that this statute implies an evidentiary exclusion rule for technical violations of the order book procedures. We need not resolve that issue in this case, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>however, because we find no reason to believe the Bedford Circuit Court failed to comply with the statute.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">Absent evidence to the contrary, we presume that public officials \u201cproperly discharged their official duties.\u201d <em>See Gilmore v. Landsidle, </em>252 Va. 388, 396, 478 S.E.2d 307, 312 (1996); <em>Crews v. Commonwealth, </em>18 Va.App. 115, 119, 442 S.E.2d 407, 409 (1994). That presumption holds in this case even though the two orders copied from the Bedford order book do not show the trial judge\u2019s signature. Tellingly, these same orders also do not show any signature line where one would ordinarily expect to find the signature of the judge. Instead, at that exact place, the following attestation appears:</p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">Bedford County Circuit Court, VA</p>\n<p id=\"APB\">Carol W. Black, Clerk</p>\n<p id=\"b807-7\">A copy teste: _</p>\n<p id=\"b807-8\">\u25a1 Clerk \u25a1 Dep. Clerk</p>\n<p id=\"b807-9\">The \u201cDep. Clerk\u201d box is checked on both orders and a deputy clerk\u2019s signature appears next to the \u201ccopy teste\u201d verification. In addition, the first page of each order identifies the specific \u201cBook\u201d and \u201cPage\u201d number where the order can be found. Each order also includes a stamp noting the date it was recorded in the clerk\u2019s order book.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-10\">These facts corroborate the presumption of regularity, rather than rebut it. That presumption provides a reasonable basis for inferring that the order book included a judge\u2019s signature or a signed term order in compliance with Code \u00a7 17.1-123(A)(ii) or (iii). As a result, we find no basis for excluding these orders from evidence under Code \u00a7 17.1-123(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>Lastly, Seaton relies on Code \u00a7 19.2-307 which requires certain topics to be addressed in criminal judgment orders (such as the defendant\u2019s plea, the court\u2019s finding of guilt, any jury waiver, the term of the sentence, and the like). <em>See generally McBride v. Commonwealth, </em>24 Va.App. 30, 34, 480 S.E.2d 126, 128 (1997) (excluding final order that failed to state that the court found the defendant guilty). The text of this statute does not contain any signature requirement. But it does require that the \u201cfinal judgment order shall be entered on a form promulgated by the Supreme Court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>That form includes a signature line for the judge on the final sentencing order. <em>See </em>Va. Sup.Ct. Buies, Part 3A, Appendix of Forms, Form 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">We nonetheless disagree with Seaton that Code \u00a7 19.2-307 renders the Bedford orders inadmissible as a matter of law. These orders were copied from the clerk\u2019s order book, not from Seaton\u2019s file folder maintained by the clerk among the circuit court criminal records. As Code \u00a7 17.1-123(A)(ii) and (iii) make clear, orders in the order book need not be individually signed so long as the judge otherwise signs the order book or enters a term order. The lack of a judge\u2019s signature on the orders copied from the order book, therefore, could not violate Code \u00a7 19.2-307 -without having the effect of repealing Code \u00a7 17.1-123(A)(ii) and (iii) \u2014 an interpretation we cannot accept.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> When \u201ctwo statutes are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>capable of co-existence, it is the duty of the courts, absent a clearly expressed [legislative] intention to the contrary, to regard each as effective.\u201d <em>FCC v. NextWave Personal Comm. Inc., </em>537 U.S. 293, 304, 123 S.Ct. 832, 840, 154 L.Ed.2d 863 (2003) (citation omitted). And to the extent such harmony cannot be achieved, the more specific statute takes precedence over the more general one. <em>Frederick County Sch. Bd. v. Hannah, </em>267 Va. 231, 236, 590 S.E.2d 567, 569 (2004).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> On the issue of who must sign what, the more specific statute is Code \u00a7 17.1-123(A) and the more general Code \u00a7 19.2-307.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">In the end, Seaton\u2019s statutory trek leads us back to first principles. Seaton knows perfectly well whether he was found guilty of rape as the Bedford orders attest. Yet, to date, he has not once challenged either order as inaccurate or unreliable. \u201cThe fundamental basis upon which all rules of evidence must rest \u2014 if they are to rest upon reason \u2014 is their adaptation to the successful development of the truth.\u201d <em>Funk v. United States, </em>290 U.S. 371, 381, 54 S.Ct. 212, 215, 78 L.Ed. 369 (1933). Because the trial judge correctly found no legal basis for excluding these orders and thereby precluding the jury from finding out the truth about Seaton\u2019s criminal past, we find no error in their admission into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-7\">In sum, we hold that sufficient evidence of intimidation exists to support Seaton\u2019s robbery conviction. We likewise find no error in the trial court\u2019s evidentiary decisions, either during the guilt or penalty phrase of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b795-8\">. Hudson also recalled Callahan, at some point, saying, \"No, I\u2019m not going to,\u201d when Seaton demanded the money. Callahan, however, testified that she did not recall \"ever telling him no.\u201d Given that we review conflicting evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, we assume as true Callahan\u2019s testimony on this point.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b797-6\">. This standard comes from Code \u00a7 8.01-680 \u2014 the basis for our appellate review of factfinding in civil and criminal cases as well as bench and jury trials. The standard remains the same for our sufficiency review of criminal cases, <em>see, e.g., Crowder, </em>41 Va.App. at 663, 588 S.E.2d at 387; <em>Hoambrecker v. City of Lynchburg, </em>13 Va.App. 511, 514, 412 S.E.2d 729, 731 (1992), as it does for the Virginia Supreme Court\u2019s sufficiency review of civil cases, <em>see, e.g., Norfolk &amp; W.R. Co. v. Spencer, </em>104 Va. 657, 664, 52 S.E. 310, 313 (1905) (holding that \"it is impossible to say that reasonable men might not differ in their judgment upon the question ... and therefore this court would not be warranted in disturbing the verdict of the jury\u201d); <em>Andrews v. Ring, </em>266 Va. 311, 322, 585 S.E.2d 780, 786 (2003) (noting that a fact issue \"presents a jury question unless reasonable minds cannot differ\u201d), and for the trial court\u2019s review of a motion to set aside a jury verdict, <em>see, e.g., Blake Constr. Co./Poole &amp; Kent v. Upper Occoquan Sewage Auth., </em>266 Va. 564, 571, 587 S.E.2d 711, 715 (2003) (the power to set aside a verdict under Code \u00a7 8.01-680 can be exercised only if no \"reasonable\u201d jurors could \"differ in their conclusions of fact to be drawn from the evidence\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b798-8\">. As the jury instruction correctly stated, the \u201cviolence or intimidation\u201d element of the offense is a disjunctive test under common law. Because of our holding, we need not address the Commonwealth\u2019s alternative argument that \u201cviolence\u201d was proven here on the theory that Seaton implied he had a concealed weapon when he issued his ten-second threat. <em>Cf. Chappelle v. Commonwealth, </em>28 Va.App. 272, 273, 504 S.E.2d 378, 378 (1998) (finding \u201cviolence\u201d proven because an armed robber told the victim to \"give him money\u201d and the victim did so even though he admitted he \u201cfelt no fear\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b803-8\">. Because of our holding, we do not decide whether Hudson, as the bank branch manager, had constructive possession of the money in Callahan\u2019s cash drawer. <em>See, e.g., Clay v. Commonwealth, </em>30 Va.App. 254, 262, 516 S.E.2d 684, 687 (1999) <em>(en banc) </em>(affirming conviction of two counts of robbery where defendant took one victim\u2019s coat and another victim's money was in the pocket of the coat); <em>Waters v.

In this regard, <em>Bivins </em>also defined intimidation to include \"[ujlawful coercion; extortion; duress; putting in fear.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 752, 454 S.E.2d at 742 (quoting <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>831 (6th ed.1990)). At common law, threats of harm to a dwelling and certain accusations of criminality could satisfy the intimidation element. <em>See generally </em>3 Wayne R. LaFave, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 20.3(d), at 187.

Seaton\u2019s argument also overlooks that Form 10 involves only a final sentencing order. See <em>Jewel v.

Nothing in Code \u00a7 19.2-307 or the mandatory form requires a judge\u2019s signature on the prior, purely interlocutory, conviction order. The trial court enters this order after the jury verdict, but before the final sentencing order. The first of the Bedford orders is a mere conviction order and the second a final sentencing order. The proper admission of the first, therefore, would render harmless any putative error in admitting the second. <em>See Byrd v.
