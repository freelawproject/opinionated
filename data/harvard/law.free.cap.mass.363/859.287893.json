L. c. 58A, \u00a7 13, by Earle C. and Bernice D. Parks (taxpayers) from a decision of the Appellate Tax Board (board) affirming the denial by the State Tax Commission (commission) of the taxpayers\u2019 application for an abatement of their 1967 Massachusetts income tax based upon a Federal deficiency income tax paid during 1969. The case was before the board on a statement of agreed facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-12\">The taxpayers\u2019 1967 joint Federal income tax return was audited by the Internal Revenue Service in 1969, resulting in the disallowance of $6,899.22 for business deductions and $200.98 for medical expense deductions. This resulted in a $4,022.84 Federal deficiency for the year 1967. The taxpayers paid the deficiency in 1969. The Commonwealth then audited the taxpayers\u2019 1967 State income tax return, disallowed the same deductions, and assessed an additional tax of $218.33 plus $39.30 in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>interest for the year 1967. The taxpayers paid these amounts under protest in 1971, and filed with the commission an application for abatement, which resulted in the instant litigation. The basis for the application for abatement was that while the commission opened up the year 1967 in order to disallow deductions, it refused to allow the taxpayers to deduct the Federal deficiency payment made in 1969, for the 1967 taxable year. The application was denied because of St. 1969, c. 546, \u00a7 l, <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which the commission interpreted as eliminating the deduction for Federal income tax <em>paid </em>on business income after December 31, 1968. The commission agrees that had this 1967 Federal tax obligation been paid when the 1967 Federal return was filed, it would have been a deductible business expense on the taxpayers\u2019 1967 Massachusetts return.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b872-5\">The board concurred with the decision of the commission, in an opinion which relied exclusively on one of its own unpublished cases, <em>Kenna </em>v. <em>State Tax Commn. </em>Appellate Tax Board, Docket No. 56954. Because we conclude that the board\u2019s interpretation of the statute involved is erroneous, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-6\">1. Although the commission admits that the effect of the statute in force in 1967 was to shift the basis of the deduction from Federal tax <em>payments </em>to Federal tax <em>obligations, </em>see <em>Farwell </em>v. <em>State Tax Commn. </em>343 Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>116, 118, it argues that since, for deduction purposes, the Federal tax due was to be increased by Federal deficiency taxes of a prior year <em>paid </em>during the return year, Federal tax deficiencies were not deductible except in the year they were paid. It argues further that since the taxpayers\u2019 Federal tax deficiency was not paid until 1969, it would not be deductible until that year. However, since St. 1969, c. 546, \u00a7 1, eliminated the Federal tax deduction, taxpayers were \u201ccaught in the middle of a tax amendment which no longer provided any deduction or exemption for taxes paid by . . . [them] to the federal government.\u201d The board affirmed this view.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">This approach is erroneous in at least two respects. First, it assumes that, since under the statute in force in 1967 the deduction for Federal tax due was to be increased by deficiencies <em>paid, </em>this was the exclusive method of accounting for Federal tax deficiencies for Massachusetts income tax purposes. This ignores the proviso at the end of the same section which states that the Federal tax due was to be increased by deficiencies paid, \u201cprovided that such deficiency . . . has not been taken into account in computing the taxpayer\u2019s liability under this chapter for such prior taxable year. . . .\u201d G. L. c. 62, \u00a7 6 (c), as appearing in St. 1960, c. 556, \u00a7 1. This proviso would only have meaning if Federal deficiency payments could be deducted or accounted for in a year other than the one in which they were paid. That a taxpayer may deduct a Federal deficiency tax in the year in which it was due alternatively to the year in which it was paid is a reasonable expectation, especially where prior years\u2019 returns are opened in subsequent audits, as in the case before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-6\">The second error relates to the commission\u2019s and the board\u2019s interpretation of St. 1969, c. 546, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 34. They concluded that these sections \u201cno longer provided any deduction . . , for taxes <em>paid </em>... to the federal government\u201d (emphasis added). This is not what the statute says. Section 1 provides that \u201c(1) in the case of taxes imposed by the United States with respect to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>income from the profession, employment, trade or business, no amount shall be deductible.\u201d Section 34 provides that \u201c[s]ection one shall take effect upon passage of this act and shall apply with respect to taxable years commencing after December thirty-first, nineteen hundred and sixty-eight.\u201d In short, no Federal taxes were to be deductible with respect to taxable years commencing after December 31, 1968. The statute says nothing about payments, contrary to the commission\u2019s contention. The taxpayers\u2019 Federal deficiency assessment paid in 1969, was a Federal tax with respect to the taxable year 1967. Therefore, St. 1969, c. 546, \u00a7 1, does not prevent its deduction. St. 1969, c. 546, \u00a7 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-5\">2. Since our interpretation of the relevant statute settles the issue, we need not reach the constitutional questions raised by the board\u2019s interpretation of the statute. We note also that G. L. c. 62, \u00a7 6 (c), as appearing in St. 1969, c. 546, \u00a7 1, has been struck by St. 197\u00cd, c. 555, \u00a7 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-6\">3. The decision of the Appellate Tax Board is reversed. Since there appears to be no dispute over the amount involved, the taxpayers\u2019 application for abatement is to be granted in the amount of $123.71 with interest at six per cent per annum from March 31, 1971. G. L. c. 58A, \u00a7 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b872-7\"> This section amended G. L c. 62, \u00a7 6 (c), by striking out par. (1) and inserting in its place the following: \u201c(1) in the case of taxes imposed by the United States with respect to income from the profession, employment, trade or business, no amount shall be deductible.\u201d Section 34 of St. 1969, c. 546, made this amendment applicable with respect to taxable years commencing after December 31, 1968.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b872-9\"> The relevant portion of G.
