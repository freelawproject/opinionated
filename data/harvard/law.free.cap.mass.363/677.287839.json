L. c. 278, \u00a7 \u00a7 33A-33G, the defendant asks us to rule that the val<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>idity of his guilty pleas may be challenged by a motion for a new trial under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 29, as amended through St. 1966, c. 301. The trial judge took a contrary view and denied such a motion. The defendant asserts, and we agree, that the remedy by motion is suitable for the purpose, and that such use of it is a logical application of the reasoning in <em>Earl </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>356 Mass. 181. Accordingly, we reverse the order denying a new trial and remand the case for hearing on the motion.-</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">In November, 1968, the defendant was indicted for murder and attempted armed robbery committed September 16,1968. On February 27,1969, he pleaded guilty to murder in the second degree and to attempted armed robbery, and was sentenced. In January, 1972, he filed on his own behalf a written motion for a new trial. The motion, sworn to by him, alleged among other things that he was deprived of a mental examination prior to his \u201ctrial,\u201d that his counsel waived mental examination contrary to his desire and without his knowledge, and that he was incompetent during his \u201ctrial\u201d and could not intelligently assist in his defence.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">On January 28, 1972, the motion was heard and denied. The transcript discloses appearances by an assistant district attorney and by counsel for the defendant and a statement by the judge, but no statement or opportunity for statement by the defendant or his counsel. The judge ruled that a new trial could not be granted where there had never been a trial, and that as a motion to retract a guilty plea under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 29C, the motion was not timely. He then said, \u201cThe only other interpretation that I could give to this instrument would be to treat it as a motion to retract your plea of guilty, because as you say, it was not intelligently and knowingly made.\u201d He read the questions put by the court before the plea was accepted and the defendant\u2019s answers to those questions, ruled that the plea was intelligently and knowingly made, and denied the motion. A written claim of exception dated the same day at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>prison was filed by mail on February 3, 1972, and a claim of appeal was filed February 8, 1972.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">1. Since the defendant was indicted for murder, the case remained subject to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7\u00a7 33A-33G, notwithstanding his plea of guilty to murder in the second degree. <em>Guilmette </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>344 Mass. 527, 528. His appeal was timely. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Millen, </em>290 Mass. 406, 411, fn.; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McGarty, </em>351 Mass. 707.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">2. The judge\u2019s ruling that \u201ca new trial cannot be granted where there has never been a trial\u201d was in accord with several decisions of this court. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Soderquest, </em>183 Mass. 199, 201. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Phelan, </em>271 Mass. 21, 22. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brody, </em>328 Mass. 521, 523-524. Those decisions did not rest entirely on word play; they fitted into a legal setting which emphasized the public interest in the finality of convictions in criminal cases. A motion for a new trial came too late if made after sentence and more than a year after verdict. G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 29, as'amended through St. 1962, c. 310, \u00a7 1. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sacco, </em>261 Mass. 12, 15. See <em>Aronson </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>331 Mass. 599, 603-604. A motion to vacate sentence could not be considered after the end of the sitting at which the sentence was imposed. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brody, </em>328 Mass. 521, 524. Compare G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 29C, allowing sixty days after sentence; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burrone, </em>347 Mass. 451, 452; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>L'Italien, </em>352 Mass. 424, 425, fn. 1. Relief after sentence was, however, open by writ of error or by appeal for clemency to the Governor. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dascalakis, </em>246 Mass. 12, 20. Insanity of the defendant has long been recognized as a basis for a writ of error. See <em>Hathaway </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>7 Pick. 144; <em>Blankenburg </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>260 Mass. 369, 376.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">In 1965 we took note of \u201cthe gradual and necessary expansion of the statutory writ of error (G. L. c. 250, \u00a7 \u00a7 1, 9) as a postconviction remedy broad enough to deal with constitutional problems arising under recent decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d <em>Shop</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number><em>pers\u2019 World, Inc. </em>v. Assessors <em>of Framingham, </em>348 Mass. 366, 376, fn. 9. In the Federal courts those decisions produced \u201cdramatic change\u201d in the functions of the writ of habeas corpus. See <em>Hensley </em>v. <em>Municipal Court, </em>U. S. 411, 345, 349-350; <em>Preiser </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>411 U. S.-475, 485-488. By St. 1964, c. 82, the one year limit on motions for a new trial under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 29, was removed, and such a motion is now permitted \u201cat any time.\u201d In <em>Earl </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>356 Mass. 181, 183, decided in 1969, we took note of the change in the statute. We recognized that a single justice of this court had power to entertain \u201ca writ of error involving alleged misconduct on the part of a prosecutor,\u201d but thought it preferable \u201cthat these questions be resolved in the first instance by the trial judge upon a motion for new trial. The effect of this practice will be to place in the hands of the trial judge, rather than in the hands of the single justice, the task of resolving factual disputes underlying alleged constitutional errors. The petitioner will retain the right to a full review by this court on questions of constitutional interpretation as well as of sufficiency of the evidence to support the trial judge\u2019s factual determinations.\u201d See American Bar Association, Standards Relating to Post-Conviction Remedies (Approved Draft, 1968), pp. 23, 30,32.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">In the present case the defendant has a petition for writ of error pending before the single justice of this court. The single justice could transfer that petition to the Superior Court under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 4A, as appearing in St. 1972, c. 740, \u00a7 2, but it has not been the practice to transfer writs of error to the court whose judgment is attacked. Compare <em>Needel, petitioner, </em>344 Mass. 260; <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen. </em>354 Mass. 384, 388. This court has in the past considered the merits of writs of error involving the validity of pleas of guilty. <em>Guilmette </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>344 Mass. 527, 529. <em>Huot </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, ante, </em>91, 101-102. In at least one case, however, a single justice of this court, on the authority of the <em>Earl </em>case, has sustained a demurrer to a petition for such a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>writ of error, on the ground that the matter should be dealt with by a motion for a new trial. <em>Foster </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>Supreme Judicial Court No. 72-177 Law, August 9, 1972. As in the <em>Earl </em>case, we think the remedy by such a motion is preferable. To the extent that the <em>Soderquest, Phelan </em>and <em>Brody </em>cases would bar the remedy, we no longer follow them.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">3. \u201cThe motion for a new trial is usually a matter for the trial judge\u2019s sound discretion. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dascalakis, </em>246 Mass. 12, 25, 32. If however the original trial was infected with prejudicial constitutional error the judge has no discretion to deny a new trial.\u201d <em>Earl </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>356 Mass. 181, 184. Similarly, in the absence of waiver or other bar, there is no discretion to deny a new trial if a plea of guilty is entered in violation of a constitutional right of the defendant. In the present case the judge did not rule on the defendant\u2019s claim that entry of his guilty plea while he was legally incompetent violated his constitutional rights of due process. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vailes, </em>360 Mass. 522, 524, and cases cited. The order denying a new trial is therefore reversed and the case is remanded for consideration of the defendant\u2019s constitutional claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
