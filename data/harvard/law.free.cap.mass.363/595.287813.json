L. c. 258A in the District Court of Springfield. After trial, the District Court judge found for the respondent. The petitioners claimed a report to the Appellate Division for the Western District based on the trial judge\u2019s denial of their requests for rulings concerning the proper construction and application of c. 258A to the facts of the instant case. The Appellate Division found \u201cno prejudicial error by the trial judge\u201d and dismissed the report. The petitioners appeal this ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-11\">All of the issues presented by this appeal concern the manner of computing damages recoverable by the victims (and their dependants) of violent crimes within the meaning of G. L. c. 258A. Section 5 of c. 258A, inserted by St. 1967, c. 852, \u00a7 1, provides in pertinent part: \u201cAny compensation paid under this chapter shall be in an amount not exceeding out-of-pocket loss, together with loss of earnings or support resulting from such injury. Any compensation for loss of earnings or support shall be in an amount equal to the actual loss sustained; provided, however, that no award under this chapter shall exceed ten thousand dollars.\u201d Section 6 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>of c. 258A provides in part: \u201cAny compensation paid pursuant to this chapter shall be reduced by the amount of any payments received or to be received as a result of the injury (a) from or on behalf of the offender, (b) under insurance programs, or (c) from public funds.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">1. In their requests for rulings, the petitioners sought a construction of the statutory phrase \u201ccompensation for loss of earnings or support\u201d to include <em>future </em>loss of earnings and support. We believe that such an interpretation is required by both the language and purpose of this statute. The Commonwealth does not argue to the contrary. Clearly, the statute covers the loss of future support when a victim of a violent crime is disabled. We can see no logical reason why the victim\u2019s death should not be treated as a permanent loss of support to be computed on the basis of life expectancy evidence and actuarial tables in determining the victim\u2019s future loss of earning capacity. See <em>Cuddy </em>v. <em>L &amp; M Equip. Co. </em>352 Mass. 458; <em>Roddy </em>v. <em>Fleischman Distil. Sales Corp. </em>360 Mass. 623, 628-629. We conclude that the judge erred in the denial of the petitioners\u2019 request for a ruling to this effect. However, the judge properly made a finding that the victim had a life expectancy of 38.19 years with an earning capacity of $324,961.76.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">2. The petitioners requested the judge to rule that \u201c[a]ny subtractions from the total amount of the compensation to which the claimants are entitled must be made from the total amount of compensation to which all claimants are entitled without regard to, and before, application of the ten thousand ($10,000.00) dollar maximum award specified in General Laws, Chapter 258A, Section 5.\u201d The judge denied this request for ruling and instead granted the Commonwealth\u2019s request for ruling which computed damages by first applying a $10,000 limit to the actual loss sustained (which exceeded $10,000 in the instant case) and then subtracting all the benefits received as a result of the injury from the $10,000 figure. These two opposing theories of damage computation pose the central question for our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>decision and require a determination of legislative intent as to the import of the $10,000 limitation in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">We think this question of statutory construction is resolved by the express language of \u00a7 5 which provides that \u201c[a]ny compensation for loss of earnings or support shall be in an amount equal to the actual loss sustained; provided, however, that <em>no award under this chapter </em>shall exceed ten thousand dollars\u201d (emphasis supplied). Where the language of a statute is plain, it must be interpreted in accordance with the usual and natural meaning of the words.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>359 Mass. 386, 387. The unambiguous reference to \u201cno award under this chapter\u201d indicates that the General Court intended the $10,000 figure to limit the final recovery under this statute. The use of the word \u201caward\u201d and the reference to the entire \u201cchapter\u201d lead us to conclude that the $10,000 provision is not a specific ceiling on the computation of the \u201cactual loss sustained\u201d but a general limitation applying to the ultimate \u201caward\u201d due under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">Therefore, we hold that it was error for the judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>to deny the petitioners\u2019 requests for rulings numbered 14 and 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">The \u201cactual loss sustained\u201d is determined by deducting the benefits received as a result of the injury from the total loss sustained by the petitioners. Since the actual loss sustained exceeds the maximum award recoverable under this chapter, the petitioners are entitled to an award of $10,000 minus the statutory deduction of $100.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">3. The petitioners argue that the judge committed prejudicial error in denying their requests for rulings that no deductions should be made from the compensation to which they were entitled on account of life insurance benefits and welfare payments the petitioners were receiving as a result of the victim\u2019s death. Section 6 of c. 258A provides that \u201ccompensation . . . shall be reduced by the amount of any payments received or to be received as a result of the injury ... (b) under insurance programs, or (c) from public funds.\u201d The judge correctly ruled that life insurance proceeds constitute benefits from an insurance program which are received by the petitioners as a result of the victim\u2019s injury, in this case a fatal one. Equally without merit is the petitioners\u2019 claim that welfare payments should not be deducted from the compensation due them. Welfare payments are clearly public funds which the petitioners are receiving as a result of the victim\u2019s death and therefore they are deductible under \u00a7 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">4. Finally, the petitioners claim they are entitled to have interest added to the award at the rate of six per cent per annum from the date of the victim\u2019s death to the date of payment of the award. The petitioners contend that the Legislature has generally allowed for interest payments to accrue in tort and contract cases from the date of the writ. See G. L. c. 231, \u00a7\u00a7 6B, 6C; G. L. c. 229, \u00a7 11. They ask us to \u201cinfer that the legislature had in mind the above statutory provisions authoriz<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>ing the addition of interest to awards when it enacted C. 258A.\u201d We cannot agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">The provisions for interest payments in c. 231 and c. 229 suggest that the Legislature will authorize such payments expressly when they are intended. Therefore, c. 258A\u2019s silence on the question of interest payments indicates a legislative intent not to grant them.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">The petitioners have misplaced their reliance on cases where this court has awarded interest despite the absence of express statutory authorization. See <em>New York Bank Note Co. </em>v. <em>Kidder Press Mfg. Co. </em>192 Mass. 391. These cases are based on contract law and are not controlling in a noncontractual context where the Commonwealth has voluntarily waived its sovereign immunity to a limited extent in order to compensate victims of violent crimes; a right which did not exist prior to the enactment of G. L. c. 258A. See <em>School Comm. of Boston </em>v. <em>Board of Educ. ante, </em>20, 31-32. In waiving its immunity, the Commonwealth established certain rights of recovery which cannot be extended beyond those expressly conferred by the statute. See <em>Putnam Furniture Bldg. Inc. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>323 Mass. 179, 185; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>347 Mass. 453, 456.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">5. The order of the Appellate Division is reversed. The case is remanded to the District Court of Springfield where judgment for the petitioners shall be entered in the sum of $9,900 to \u201cbe apportioned by the court among the claimants in proportion to their loss.\u201d G. L. c. 258A, \u00a7 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b610-7\"> The Commonwealth argues that in interpreting \u00a7 5\u2019s $10,000 limitation, we should consider the legislative history of c. 258A which indicates \u201can overall pattern by the legislature to limit and restrict the amount of compensation paid\u201d as is evidenced by the statute\u2019s exclusion of pain and suffering damages and its express request in \u00a7 6 that \u201c[t]he court shall take into consideration . . . the availability of funds appropriated for the purpose of this chapter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b610-8\">However, there is no need for us to resort to legislative history when the statute\u2019s language is unambiguous. <em>Chouinard, petitioner, </em>358 Mass. 780, 782. Moreover, our construction of c. 258A places a $10,000 ceiling on any award allowed under the chapter; a limit which <em>is </em>consistent with the General Court\u2019s desire to \u201crestrict the amount of compensation paid.\u201d Finally, it should be added that \u00a7 6\u2019s vague and impractical admonition that courts should consider \u201cthe availability of funds appropriated for the purpose of this chapter\u201d cannot invalidate the express concrete provisions of the statute establishing a specific method of computing the damages to which a proper claimant is entitled. Both trial and appellate courts must follow the specific procedures established by c. 258A; their decisions cannot be based on or affected by judicial speculation as to whether the Legislature will appropriate sufficient funds to meet the obligations it has voluntarily undertaken by enacting c. 285A. Once judgment is entered, it is enforceable as any other judgment of the court. See <em>O\u2019Coin\u2019s, Inc. </em>v. <em>Treasurer of the. County of Worcester, </em>362 Mass.-507.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b611-8\"> See \u00a7 5. \u201cOne hundred dollars shall be deducted from any award granted under this chapter.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b612-9\"> Nor does the Report of the Special Commission on the Compensation of Victims of Violent Crimes, 1967 House Doc.
