DCA seeks a declaration that it had authority to promulgate five sets of regulations covering local housing authorities (LHAs) like MHA: (a) Income and Occupancy Regulations, (b) Regulations for the Determination of Rents in State-Aided Low Rent Housing, (c) Regulations Prescribing Lease Provisions for Public Housing, (d) Regulations Relating to Tenant Grievance Procedures, and (e) Regulations for Tenant Participation in the Administration of Public Housing in Massachusetts. DCA also seeks injunctive relief to enforce the declaration. MHA denies the authority of DCA to promulgate the regulations and refuses to comply with them.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-11\">In the companion case, four tenants of State-aided public housing in Medford seek similar relief against MHA. A single justice of this court allowed a motion to consolidate the two suits and reserved and reported them for determination by the full court upon the pleadings and a statement of agreed facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-12\">We summarize the agreed facts. MHA is obliged by its \u201cFinancial Assistance Contracts\u201d with the Commonwealth to administer its State-aided housing projects in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>accordance with DCA regulations. The Income and Occupancy Regulations promulgated by DCA became effective December 30, 1971; they provided that within one month of their effective date MHA should submit to DCA a description of its procedure for determining tenants\u2019 income. MHA has not done so. Before January, 1972, MHA required all its tenants to submit annually applications for continued occupancy and copies of W-2 Forms filed with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in the previous year. In January, 1972, MHA notified its tenants that each was also required to furnish Form 4506, which would allow MHA to obtain a copy of page 1 of the tenants\u2019 Federal income tax return. This \u201c4506 procedure\u201d has never been submitted to or approved by DCA; by letters dated March 2, 1972, and April 5, 1972, DCA disapproved the procedure and directed MHA to discontinue it and to notify DCA as to the steps taken. MHA has not so notified DCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\">In July, 1972, MHA voted to initiate eviction proceedings against tenants who failed to comply with the \u201c4506 procedure.\u201d Forty-two of 766 tenants failed to comply, and about February 7, 1973, MHA notified the four tenant plaintiffs and two tenants of federally-aided projects of its intent to evict them. After a hearing held on February 26, 1973, at the request of those six tenants, MHA voted to evict each of them. On or before March 1, 1973, notice of intention to terminate the tenancy on April 1,1973, was served on each of the six tenants.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">On February 22, 1973, DCA issued the remaining four sets of regulations here in issue. Those regulations were filed with the Secretary of State on February 26, 1973, and published by him on March 2, 1973. By a letter dated March 9, 1973, DCA again disapproved the \u201c4506 procedure\u201d and ordered MHA to discontinue it. These suits followed, and a preliminary injunction was issued against the threatened evictions. The Boston Housing Authority and the Somerville Housing Authority filed a brief as friends of the court supporting the position of DCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>1. <em>Authority for these suits. </em>The suit by DCA is authorized by G. L. c. 121B, \u00a7 29, inserted by St. 1969, c. 751, \u00a7 1: \u201cExcept as otherwise stated therein, compliance with this chapter, the rules and regulations adopted by the department and the terms of any low-rent housing project or clearance project authorized by this chapter, may be enforced by a proceeding in equity.\u201d See the prior provision, G. L. c. 121, \u00a7 26U; <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Fall River Housing Authy. </em>348 Mass. 738, 739. The <em>Sullivan </em>case raises some question as to the authorization for the suit by the tenants. But no objection is made on that account, the tenants have an obvious and vital interest in the controversy, and the consolidation of the two suits is like allowance of a motion to allow the tenants to intervene in the DCA suit. It amounts to no more than an opportunity for the tenants to argue as friends of the court. See <em>Cambridge Elec. Light Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Util. ante, </em>474, 504. Compare <em>West Broadway Task Force, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dept. of Community Affairs, ante, </em>745, 749-751.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">2. <em>Authority for regulations. </em>The basic controversy relates to the scope of DCA\u2019s power to issue regulations under G. L. c. 23B, \u00a7 6,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and c. 121B, \u00a7 29.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> DCA contends, relying on the legislative history of the statutes, that the Legislature intended LHAs to be \u201coperating agencies\u201d (G. L. c. 121B, \u00a7 1) subject to the broad supervision and control of DCA. See 1938 House Doc. No. 1706, pp. 12-14; 1970 House Doc. No. 5000, pp. 10-14; 1970 House Doc. No. 5263, pp. 2-3; Rep. A. G., Pub. Doc. No. 12 (1967) 237; Rep. A. G., Pub. Doc. No. 12 (1971) 49. It points also to G. L. c. 121B, \u00a7 11 (m), as amended by St. 1970, c. 851, \u00a7 2, under which an \u201coperating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>agency\u201d has the power \u201c(m) To make, and from time to time amend or repeal, <em>subject to the approval of the </em>department, by-laws, rules and regulations, not inconsistent with pertinent rules and regulations of the department to govern its proceedings and effectuate the purposes of this chapter\u201d (emphasis supplied). MHA responds that DCA has no legislative authority to make rules for the internal operation of local housing projects, that the DCA regulations, instead of prescribing \u201cstandards\u201d and \u201cprinciples,\u201d restrict the operations of the LHA and take away any individual discretion in its essential operating and management functions, and that G. L. c. 121B, \u00a7 32, spells out in detail the requirements the LHA must follow in the internal operation of its affairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">Without extended discussion, we hold that DCA is right and MHA is wrong in this basic controversy. We have recognized the \u201csupervisory capacity\u201d of the responsible State agency under predecessor statutes. G. L. c. 121, \u00a7 26EE, as appearing in St. 1938, c. 484, \u00a7 1. <em>Wellesley Housing Authy. </em>v. <em>S. &amp; A. Allen Constr. Co. </em>340 Mass. 466, 473. <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Fall River Housing Authy. </em>348 Mass. 738, 739. <em>Belinfante </em>v. <em>Mayor of Revere, </em>352 Mass. 712, 714. We do not find in the statutes any such distinction between standards and principles, on the one hand, and internal operations, on the other, as that for which MHA contends. See <em>Cambridge Elec. Light Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Util. ante, </em>474, 494-495. General Laws c. 121B, \u00a7 29, authorizes \u201cregulations prescribing standards and stating principles governing the . . . maintenance and operation of . . . housing projects by housing authorities.\u201d The authority so granted is ample to cover large matters and small, procedural and substantive, internal and external. Any type of decision which is open to LHAs is also open to supervision by DCA. See <em>West Broadway Task Force, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dept. of Community Affairs, ante, </em>745, 747-748; Friedman, Public Housing and the Poor: An Overview, 54 Cal. L. Rev. 642, 662-669.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>3. <em>The \u201c4-506 </em>procedure.\u201d It is common ground that the standards and tests of eligibility of tenants for continued occupancy are to be those prescribed by DCA in accordance with the law. Similarly, it is not disputed that to determine eligibility LHAs must determine the net income of each tenant family, nor that they may properly require annual submission of an application for continued occupancy. There is no attack on MHA\u2019s requirements that the application contain an income statement and be accompanied by W-2 Forms. But it is disputed\" whether MHA may properly require tenants to execute IRS Form 4506, requesting IRS to furnish to MHA a copy of page 1 of the tenants\u2019 Federal income tax return.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">This \u201c4506 procedure,\u201d if proper, is part of the \u201cbylaws, rules and regulations\u201d of MHA, and under G. L. c. 121B, \u00a7 11 (m), is \u201csubject to the approval of the department\u201d and must not be \u201cinconsistent with pertinent rules and regulations of the department.\u201d To implement \u00a7 11 (m), DCA Income and Occupancy Regulations, \u00a7\u00a7 1.1 and 1.2, properly require LHAs to send to DCA copies of detailed descriptions of their income and rental determination procedures. MHA did not do so, nor did it seek or obtain DCA\u2019s approval of the requirement. MHA alleges that it had no knowledge of the regulation prior to suit, but it was specifically notified in writing three times that DCA disapproved the MHA requirement. It follows that the establishment of the \u201c4506 procedure\u201d by MHA was ineffective under G. L. c. 121B, \u00a7 11 (m), in the absence of DCA approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">Initially DCA flatly disapproved any requirement \u201cthat tenants submit a photostatic copy of their tax return from the Internal Revenue Service, for occupancy or continued occupancy.\u201d The DCA regulations issued February 22, 1973, however, forbid a requirement \u201cthat tenants disclose copies of income tax returns or portions thereof, unless the LHA has established reasonable cause that the tenant is supplying false or incomplete information.\u201d DCA Regulations for the Determination of Rents in State-Aided Low Rent Housing, \u00a7 3H (2). MHA con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>tends with some force that the \u201c4506 procedure\u201d provides the best available verification of tenants\u2019 incomes, that it involves no harassment or unwarranted intrusion into private affairs of the tenants, and that no one has suggested how MHA can establish \u201creasonable cause\u201d without any investigative staff or investigative powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\">We assume, without deciding, that there is no obstacle to the \u201c4506 procedure\u201d in the Federal tax laws. See <em>Finance Commn. of Boston </em>v. <em>McGrath, </em>343 Mass. 754, 766-768. Reasonable men may differ, however, as to the wisdom or even the constitutionality of compulsory disclosure of tax returns for purposes other than administration of the tax laws. See <em>Leave </em>v. <em>Boston Elev. Ry. </em>306 Mass. 391, 398-403; <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>328 Mass. 663, 665-666, 672-673 (separate opinion of Counihan, J.); <em>Grand Jurors for Worcester County for the Year 1951 </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corps. &amp; Taxn. </em>329 Mass. 89, 90-91; <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>354 Mass. 804, 809-810. It is not contended that there is any statutory mandate for the \u201c4506 procedure.\u201d It follows that it is within the power of DCA to disapprove that procedure or to direct that it be employed only in restricted circumstances. The remedy of MHA, if it believes that the disapproval or restriction is unwise, is not to disobey, but to seek to persuade DCA to do the wise thing.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-6\">4. <em>Validity of other regulations. </em>In support of its broad attack on the regulatory powers of DCA, MHA makes a variety of adverse comments on specific provisions of the five sets of regulations here in issue. Except for the specific controversy with respect to the \u201c4506 procedure,\u201d discussed above,. those comments seem to raise \u201cabstract, hypothetical or contingent questions\u201d inappropriate for judicial resolution. See <em>Thorpe </em>v. <em>Housing Authy. of Durham, </em>393 U. S. 268, 284; <em>Housing Authy. of Omaha </em>v. <em>United States Housing Authy. </em>468 F. 2d 1, 10 (8th Cir.), cert. den. 410 U. S. 927. Moreover, so far as the regulations have not yet been put to practical use, MHA could ask from the court at this time an opinion only as to their \u201capparent or surface valid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>ity,\u201d subject to reconsideration if practice should show up particular features in a new light. <em>Cambridge Elec. Light Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Util. ante, </em>474, 494.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">The Income and Occupancy Regulations, effective December 30, 1971, have been largely superseded by the more detailed regulations promulgated February 22, 1973. DCA concedes that certain provisions of the rent determination regulations may be in conflict with the governing statutes, and informs us that those provisions are in the process of being rescinded. The regulations prescribing lease provisions require LHAs to submit leases for approval by June 30, 1973, but provide for extensions to August 31, 1973; the grievance procedure regulations require LHAs to adopt such procedures on a similar schedule. A model lease and a model grievance procedure are provided, but language may be changed so long as \u201cminimum requirements\u201d are met; even the minimum requirements may be waived by DCA. The regulations for tenant participation in administration likewise provide \u201cminimum requirements\u201d subject to waiver; \u201cspecifics\u201d are to be \u201cdefined and agreed upon between the LHA and the public housing community at the local level.\u201d Interim provisions are made which are presently in effect, but no actual controversy with respect to them remains once the controversy with respect to the \u201c4506 procedure\u201d is resolved.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-6\">In this situation we express no opinion as to interpretation or validity with respect to specific details, or on MHA\u2019s suggestions that various provisions are in conflict with specific statutory provisions. We do hold, however, contrary to MHA\u2019s contention, that the fact that a regulation has the effect of requiring an expenditure of funds does not establish a violation of the policy that \u201ceach housing authority shall manage and operate decent, safe and sanitary dwelling accommodations at the lowest possible cost.\u201d G. L. c. 121B, \u00a7 32. We note that the DCA regulations are similar in many respects to circulars promulgated earlier by the Renewal and Housing Management Division of the Federal Department of Housing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>and Urban Development. In the face of a statutory policy of local autonomy which has no counterpart in the Massachusetts statutes, those circulars have been uniformly upheld. 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 1401 (1970). <em>Glover </em>v. <em>Housing Authy. of Bessemer, </em>444 F. 2d 158 (5th Cir.). <em>Housing Authy. of Omaha </em>v. <em>United States Housing Authy. </em>468 F. 2d 1 (8th Cir.), cert. den. 410 U. S. 927. <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Housing Authy. of Milwaukee, </em>471 F. 2d 63 (7th Cir.). <em>Chicago Housing Authy. </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>49 Ill. 2d 274. <em>Housing Authy. of Milwaukee </em>v. <em>Mosby, </em>53 Wis. 2d 275. See Lefcoe, HUD\u2019s Authority to Mandate Tenants\u2019 Rights in Public Housing, 80 Yale L. J. 463, 476-491; Note, 86 Harv. L. Rev. 880, 913.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">5. <em>Federally-aided housing. </em>DCA\u2019s bill alleges that MHA is obliged to operate federally-aided housing projects as well as State-aided projects in accordance with DCA regulations. MHA denies that allegation in its answer, but without drawing any distinction between State-aided projects and federally-aided projects. The statement of agreed facts, which the parties agree contains \u201call the facts material to the issues in this proceeding,\u201d likewise draws no such distinction, except that four of the tenants threatened with eviction are said to be tenants of State-aided projects, two of federally-aided projects.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">DCA argues that its regulatory authority extends to federally-aided projects, and that its regulations are not preempted by Federal regulations, citing <em>Florida Lime &amp; Avocado Growers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Paul, </em>373 U. S. 132, 142, <em>Commissioner of Labor &amp; Indus. </em>v. <em>Boston Housing Authy. </em>345 Mass. 406, 414-416, <em>Commissioner of Labor &amp; Indus. </em>v. <em>Lawrence Housing Authy. </em>358 Mass. 202, 207-210, <em>Glover </em>v. <em>Housing Authy. of Bessemer, </em>444 F. 2d 158 (5th Cir.), and <em>Housing Authy. of Omaha </em>v. <em>United States Housing Authy. </em>468 F. 2d 1 (8th Cir.), cert. den. 410 U. S. 927. MHA does not argue these points, and no Federal regulation has been brought to our attention which conflicts with the DCA regulations. By reply brief DCA suggests that if the point is material the cases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>could be remanded to the single justice for amendment of the statement of agreed facts to include a letter dated May 1, 1973, from the area director of the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development stating that his office \u201chas no objection\u201d to DCA\u2019s proposed lease and grievance procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">In these circumstances we do not think there is before us a \u201ccontroversy\u201d with respect to any distinct problems of federally-aided housing projects. In the absence of controversy there is no basis for declaratory or other relief. G. L. c. 30A, \u00fc 7; c. 231A, \u00a7\u00a7 1-3. See <em>Tsongas </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, </em>362 Mass. 708, 714-715; <em>Cambridge Elec. Light Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Util. ante, </em>474, 493.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">6. <em>Disposition. A </em>final decree is to be entered in the county court declaring that DCA had authority to promulgate the regulations at issue, and that the regulations are generally valid in the sense of this opinion (see point 4, above). A permanent injunction is to issue (1) ordering MHA to comply with the requirement of the DCA Income and Occupancy Regulations, \u00a7\u00a7 1.1 and 1.2, within one month of the entry of the decree, (2) restraining MHA from evicting any tenants for failure to furnish Form 4506 except in compliance with DCA regulations, (3) ordering MHA to return to the tenants all such forms furnished by tenants, together with any attendant fees collected from tenants, and restraining MHA from further demands for such forms except in compliance 'with DCA regulations.
