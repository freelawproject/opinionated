They are not.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-23\">The Mississippi Windstorm Underwriting Association (\u201cMWUA\u201d) was created by Mississippi\u2019s state legislature \u201cto provide an adequate market for windstorm and hail insurance in Mississippi\u2019s six coastal counties: George, Hancock, Harrison, Jackson, Pearl River, and Stone.\u201d <em>Miss. Windstorm Underwriting Ass\u2019n v. Union Nat. Fire Ins. Co., </em>86 So.3d 216, 220 (Miss. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>2012). Insurance companies offering essential property insurance in Mississippi must be MWUA members.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>\u201c[M]embers that voluntarily offer wind and hail coverage receive credit for each voluntary premium written.\u201d <em>Id. </em>At the time Hurricane Katrina hit the Gulf Coast, \u201cMWUA had secured $175 million in reinsurance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>That reinsurance was woefully inadequate in the face of Hurricane Katrina, which cost MWUA more than $700 million. <em>Id. </em>\u201cAfter the reinsurance was applied, MWUA had a $545 million loss\u201d and \u201cassessed its members to cover the loss.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Those assessments were based on premiums collected in 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">Plaintiff Greenwich Insurance Company (\u201cGreenwich\u201d) is a MWUA member and also sells Multiple Peril Crop Insurance (\u201cMPCI\u201d). Insuring crops comes with risks of its own. Indeed, once upon a time, \u201c[p]rivate insurance companies apparently deemed all-risk crop insurance too great a commercial hazard,\u201d and so refused to provide such .coverage. <em>Fed. Crop Ins. Corp. v. Merrill, </em>332 U.S. 380, 384, 68 S.Ct. 1, 3 n. 1, 92 L.Ed. 10 (1947). Accordingly, Congress created the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (\u201cFCIC\u201d), a Department of Agriculture agency. <em>See </em>7 U.S.C. \u00a7 1503.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">Thus, Greenwich is required to participate in two somewhat similar programs\u2014 one a state program, the other a federal program. In the ordinary course, dual participation presents no problems. Indeed, the parties agree that MWUA was not permitted to base the post-Katrina assessments on MPCI premiums collected by Greenwich.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">MWUA\u2019s assessment efforts were hampered by complaints of several insurance companies that they had incorrectly reported information regarding premiums collected. In an effort to provide its members an opportunity to ensure accurate reporting, MWUA conducted a <em>\u201ctrue-up\u201d </em>\u2014 i.e., an opportunity to submit corrected 2003 premium data. The true-up procedure was challenged in state court and ultimately approved of by the Mississippi Supreme Court. As that Court saw it, \u201c[t]he true-up was not an effort on behalf of MWUA to make a new rule; it was simply a remedy to the property-insurance chaos caused by Hurricane Katrina.\u201d <em>Mississippi Windstorm Underwriting Ass\u2019n, </em>86 So.3d at 223. The Mississippi Supreme Court further recognized that \u201cMWUA, and any entity for that matter, must have enforceable deadlines to operate properly.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Additionally, \u201ca change to one member\u2019s assessment would affect all other members,\u201d meaning \u201c[t]he process would be harmed if it were to remain open for years.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 227.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-11\">Greenwich was apparently among those insurers for which MWUA had faulty data. Nonetheless, for whatever reason, it did not take advantage of the true-up process. Instead, it repeatedly represented to MWUA that all figures were accurate. Specifically, Greenwich confirmed the contents of an annual statement showing it had collected no MPCI premiums in 2003. Based on those representations, MWUA assessed Greenwich $4.1 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-12\">That assessment finally prompted Greenwich to take a closer look at the reported figures. According to its brief, Greenwich \u201cimmediately began an investigation into the now decade-old data and discovered that MPCI premiums had been misclassified as assessable premiums.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>Relying on this alleged error, Greenwich objected to the assessment more than a year after the reporting deadline had passed. MWUA overruled the objection and enforced its deadline. Greenwich paid the assessment under protest and filed suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">Both parties moved unsuccessfully for summary judgment, but after additional briefing, the district court certified the question of preemption for interlocutory appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 1292(b). We granted permission to appeal the interlocutory order. We review <em>de novo </em>certified orders denying summary judgment. <em>Castellanos-Contreras v. Decatur Hotels, LLC, </em>622 F.3d 393, 397 (5th Cir.2010) (en banc). \u201c[O]ur appellate jurisdiction under \u00a7 1292(b) extends only to controlling questions of law, thus, we review only the issue of law certified for appeal.\u201d <em>Tanks v. Lockheed Martin Corp., </em>417 F.3d 456, 461 (5th Cir.2005). The issue considered here is whether MWUA\u2019s enforcement of the true-up deadline is preempted by federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">While the parties agree that this case presents one \u2022 discrete legal issue, they frame that issue in vastly different ways. According to Greenwich, MWUA based its assessment in part on MPCI premiums and therefore plainly violated controlling federal law. According to MWUA, there is no conflict in the law, and Greenwich is simply using preemption arguments in an attempt to escape the consequences of its own incompetence.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">Under the Supremacy Clause, Congress has authority to preempt state law. <em>See </em>U.S. Const., Art. VI, cl. 2. \u201cWhen a federal law contains an express preemption clause, we \u2018focus, on the plain wording of the clause, which necessarily contains the best evidence of Congress\u2019 preemptive intent.\u2019 \u201d <em>Chamber of Commerce of U.S. v. Whiting, </em>563 U.S. 582, 131 S.Ct. 1968, 1977, 179 L.Ed.2d 1031 (2011) (quoting <em>CSX Transp., Inc. v. Easterwood, </em>507 U.S. 658, 664, 113 S.Ct. 1732, 1737, 123 L.Ed.2d 387 (1993)). \u201cThe burden of persuasion in preemption cases lies with the party seeking annulment of the state statute.\u201d <em>AT &amp; T Corp. v. Pub. Util. Comm\u2019n of Texas, </em>373 F.3d 641, 645 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b661-12\">\u201cFederal regulations can have a preemptive effect equal to that of federal laws.\u201d <em>O\u2019Hara v. Gen. Motors Corp., </em>508 F.3d 753, 758 (5th Cir.2007). To find that a federal regulation preempts state law, we must be satisfied that such preemptive effect was both intended and \u201cwithin the scope of the agency\u2019s delegated authority.\u201d <em>First Gibraltar Bank, FSB v. Morales, </em>42 F.3d 895, 898 (5th Cir.1995). Greenwich relies on the following express preemption regulation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-13\">No State or local governmental body or non-governmental body shall have the authority to promulgate rules or regulations, pass laws, or issue policies or decisions that directly or indirectly affect or govern agreements, contracts, or actions authorized by this part unless such authority is specifically authorized by this part or by the Corporation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b661-14\">7 C.F.R. \u00a7 400.352(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b661-15\">According to Greenwich, because enforcement of the true-up deadline means it must pay an assessment based on otherwise non-assessable MPCI premiums, the true-up deadline \u201cdirectly or indirectly affect[s] MPCI\u201d and is therefore preempted.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b662-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>The first question before us is whether the FCIC intended to preempt MWTJA\u2019s authority to set internal administrative deadlines for its members. <em>See Moore, </em>867 F.2d at 244. \u201c[T]he exact scope of the FCIC\u2019s intended preemption\u201d is not clear from the face of the regulation. <em>See Rio Grande Underwriters, Inc. v. Pitts Farms, Inc., </em>276 F.3d 683, 687 (5th Cir.2001) (holding that the preemption regulation at issue here, 7 C.F.R. \u00a7 400.352(a), does not demonstrate an intent to completely preempt the field of crop insurance regulation); <em>see also Alliance Ins. Co. v. Wilson, </em>384 F.3d 547, 552 (8th Cir.2004) (\u201c[T]he FCIA did not intend to preempt all state-based regulation of companies that sell federally rein-sured crop insurance.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">\u201c[W]hen the text of a pre-emption clause is susceptible of more than one plausible reading, courts ordinarily \u2018accept the reading that disfavors pre-emption.\u2019 \u201d <em>Altria Grp., Inc. v. Good, </em>555 U.S. 70, 77, 129 S.Ct. 538, 543, 172 L.Ed.2d 398 (2008) (quoting <em>Bates v. Dow Agrosciences LLC, </em>544 U.S. 431, 449, 125 S.Ct. 1788, 1801, 161 L.Ed.2d 687 (2005)). Given the states\u2019 \u201ctraditional role of regulating insurance,\u201d <em>Sanger Ins. Agency v. HUB Int\u2019l, Ltd., </em>802 F.3d 732, 741 (5th Cir.2015), that presumption is particularly important in this case, <em>see Wyeth v. Levine, </em>555 U.S. 555, 565, 129 S.Ct. 1187, 1194, 173 L.Ed.2d 51 (2009) (explaining that the presumption against preemption applies with particular force when federal law encroaches on \u201c \u2018a field which the States have traditionally occupied\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Medtronic, Inc. v. Lohr, </em>518 U.S. 470, 485, 116 S.Ct. 2240, 2250, 135 L.Ed.2d 700 (1996))).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">We hold that the FCIC did not intend to preclude MWUA from imposing and enforcing its true-up deadline. Written to prevent state interference with MPCI, 7 C.F.R. \u00a7 400.352(a) is undoubtedly a broad preemption clause., But the interpretation urged upon us by Greenwich exceeds these textual bounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-8\">The challenged deadline did not directly or indirectly affect MPCI because the deadline did not trigger an assessment improperly based on MPCI premiums. Indeed, strictly speaking, even Greenwich\u2019s failure to abide by the deadline did not trigger the improper assessment. Rather, Greenwich\u2019s independent actions-specifically, its repeated affirmative statements that the 2003 premium data was correct-triggered the assessment. Greenwich reported $0 in \u201cMultiple peril crop\u201d premiums on its annual statement. (ROA. 717.) It alleges it should have reported $4,756,021 in MPCI premiums. (ROA. 675.)</p>\n<p id=\"b662-9\">Thus, \u201cin reality,\u201d Greenwich\u2019s complaint \u201cis directed at the actions of private parties, not the operation of\u2019 MWUA deadlines. <em>See New Orleans &amp; Gulf Coast Ry. Co. v. Barrois, </em>533 F.3d 321, 335 (5th Cir.2008). Because the fault lies not with any law or rule but rather with the acts of a private third party, we cannot say that the true-up-deadline affects MPCI. <em>Cf. id. </em>at 334 (\u201cThe fatal defect in the Railroad\u2019s argument is that the Railroad fails to establish that any unreasonable interference with railroad operations is caused by operation or application of the Louisiana state law as opposed to the independent actions of private parties.\u201d). Here, the source of Greenwich\u2019s trouble is not the acts of just <em>any </em>private parties; Greenwich\u2019s own acts are to blame. And, the actions themselves are not just any actions; they are acts of unjustifiable incompetence. The FCIC did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>not intend to hamstring MWUA\u2019s basic operations (or the operations of state programs like it) simply to protect inattentive insurers from their own mistakes.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b660-7\">. \"Insurance companies are no longer called members,\u201d <em>Miss.
