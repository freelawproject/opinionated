Turner, individually and as trustee of the Routes 3 and 25 Nominee Trust, has cross-appealed, orders of the Superior Court <em>0O\u2019Neill, </em>J.) following a bench trial on the petitioner\u2019s petition for a preliminary injunction enjoining a foreclosure sale and for damages and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees. The parties\u2019 dispute centers around a commercial construction loan agreement and promissory note secured by a mortgage, pursuant to which the petitioner was loaned $450,000 at 13% interest per annum to build a home. The respondents argue that the trial court erred when it: (1) determined that they would be unjustly enriched if the court required the petitioner to pay the amounts he owed under the note from November 2009 until April 2011; (2) applied the petitioner\u2019s $450,000 lump sum payment to principal; (3) excluded evidence of the petitioner\u2019s experience with similar loans; (4) ruled that, because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>promissory note failed to contain a \u201cclear statement in writing\u201d of the charges owed, as required by RSA 399-B:2 (2006), the respondents could not collect a $22,500 delinquency charge on the petitioner\u2019s lump sum payment of principal; and (5) denied the respondents\u2019 request for attorney\u2019s fees and costs. The petitioner contends that the trial court erroneously concluded that the respondents\u2019 actions did not violate the Consumer Protection Act (CPA). <em>See </em>RSA ch. 358-A (2009 &amp; Supp. 2013). We affirm in-part, reverse in part, vacate in part, and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">\n<em>I. Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">The trial court found, or the record establishes, the following facts. The petitioner owns property on Marks Island in Gilford and, in 2009, sought financing to construct a home on one of his lots. Because the home was to be constructed on an island, he was unable to obtain a construction loan with conventional financing. Financial Resources Mortgage, Inc. (FRM) procured a construction loan for the petitioner from Mark Butler, a private lender. On April 9, 2009, the petitioner and Butler executed: (1) a commercial construction loan agreement; (2) a promissory note; (3) a mortgage security agreement and assignment; and (4) a collateral assignment of rents and leases. Under the loan agreement, Butler agreed to loan the petitioner $450,000 as \u201ca bridge loan to facilitate the completion of construction\u201d of the home. The agreement required the petitioner to \u201cpay [Butler] in monthly installments on interest only on the total amount of funds loaned.\u201d The loan was secured by the mortgage and the-collateral assignment of rents and leases. The promissory note required the petitioner to repay the loan in full, with 13% interest, in one year. The note obligated him to pay Butler \u201cinterest only in Twelve (12) consecutive monthly payments of $4,875.00 each.\u201d The first payment was due on June 1,2009. The final payment, consisting of all principal, accrued interest, and charges, was due May 1, 2010. The note provided that if the petitioner defaulted on the payment of interest and principal due under the note, and failed to cure the default within a specified period of time, \u201cthe entire unpaid balance of principal and interest shall, at the option of the Holder, become due and payable at once without demand or notice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A9k\">The mortgage and note associated with the loan were assigned three times. They were first assigned in May 2009.by Butler to Dodge Financial, Inc., the then-trustee of BD 2009 Realty Trust. In November 2009, Kamal Doshi, another trustee of BD 2009 Realty Trust, assigned the mortgage and note to Shared Towers. Finally, in June 2011, Shared Towers assigned the mortgage and note to NH Note.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-9\">From April to October 2009, the petitioner made payments consistent with the terms of the loan agreement and note. He stopped making <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>payments in November 2009. In December 2009, the petitioner received a letter from the trustee appointed in the involuntary bankruptcy of FRM, which stated, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-5\">We understand that- you may have borrowed money from FRM ... or an entity or individual affiliated or related to [FRM]. If you make or are obligated to make monthly payments to any such entity or individual, you are hereby directed to make all such future payments directly to [the bankruptcy trustee].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-7\">Please note that any payments made directly [to] any other entity or individual, will NOT count as a credit to your underlying obligations. All such payments must be made to this office in order for you to receive appropriate credit. You will NOT receive credit for any payments even if a new Trustee has purportedly been appointed for any Trust that may hold the mortgage on your property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">A few weeks later, the petitioner received another letter from the trustee enclosing a bankruptcy court order. This letter stated, in pertinent part: \u201cIf you have borrowed money from FRM ... or from any trust or entity affiliated or related to FRM . . . , the Order requires that you make all monthly payments, all payments of principal, and all principal payoffs to\u201d the bankruptcy trustee. However, having also received demands from Butler and Doshi, the petitioner did not make any payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-9\">In April 2011, a settlement was reached among Butler, Doshi, Shared Towers, and the bankruptcy trustee (who was also the bankruptcy trustee for Dodge Financial, Inc. and BD 2009 Realty Trust), pursuant to which, Doshi, on behalf of Shared Towers and NH Note, took ownership of the petitioner\u2019s loan, mortgage, and promissory note.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-10\">On April 27, 2011, Shared Towers notified the petitioner that it was now the holder of the loan and the debt and that the petitioner was in default of his obligations thereunder. Shared Towers informed the petitioner that the note had matured on May 1, 2010, and that pursuant to the note, he owed: (1) $450,000 in principal; (2) $92,625 in interest; and (3) $24,206.25 in delinquency charges, which included a $22,500 charge for late payment of the lump sum principal amount. Shared Towers notified the petitioner that if he failed to pay those amounts on or before May 1, 2011, Shared Towers would \u201cpursue all of its rights and remedies\u201d under the loan documents, including, but not limited to, commencing foreclosure proceedings finder the mortgage. To defer the foreclosure sale, the petitioner paid Shared Towers $15,000. The petitioner instituted the instant action in July 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-11\">In July 2011, the trial court held a hearing on offers of proof on the petitioner\u2019s request for a preliminary injunction to enjoin the foreclosure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>sale. At the hearing, the petitioner \u201cconceded that the principal amount... which [he] legitimately owe[s] is $450,000.00.\u201d However, he disputed \u201cinterest charges, late fees and attorney fees which have added approximately $100,000 to the debt.\u201d The trial court ordered the petitioner to pay the $450,000 and ordered the respondents not to foreclose on the property until further court order. In response to the respondents\u2019 motion for clarification and/or reconsideration, the trial court clarified that the $450,000 payment \u201cshall be applied only as determined at the final hearing in this matter.\u201d Thereafter, in addition to remitting the $450,000 principal to the respondents, the petitioner paid $34,125 in interest payments from an escrow account.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">The trial court conducted a bench trial on the petitioner\u2019s remaining claims for relief. The court first decided that the respondents were not entitled to a delinquency charge on the petitioner\u2019s late payment of principal because the promissory note failed to contain a \u201cclear statement in writing\u201d that the charge would so apply. RSA 399-B-.2. The trial court next concluded that the respondents were not entitled to any payments from November 2009 until April 2011 because, during that time, ownership of the loan and note, was \u201cin flux.\u201d The court determined that because of that fact, \u201c[i]nterest payments, principal payments, and associated penalties ... should have been tolled from November 2009 through April 2011,\u201d and that, if the petitioner were now ordered to pay the respondents the payments that were due from November 2009 through April 2011, the respondents would be unjustly enriched. The court further found that the $450,000 that the petitioner remitted to the respondents pursuant to the preliminary injunction order \u201csatisfied the principal amount owed.\u201d With regard to the petitioner\u2019s damages claim, the trial court determined that the respondents did not violate the CPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">The trial court ordered the parties to \u201cprovide . . . their respective computations of total amounts, paid to date and outstanding amounts due consistent with the [court\u2019s] findings.\u201d The respondents argued that the petitioner owed four months of interest payments and the corresponding 5% penalty on each such payment, for a total of $19,500 in interest payments and $975 in penalty payments. They also argued that they were entitled to $77,836 in defense costs, including legal fees. The petitioner conceded that he owed three months of interest payments and two 5% penalty payments, for a total of $14,625 in interest payments and $487.50 in penalties. The petitioner argued that, after subtracting the $15,000 he paid to defer the foreclosure, he owed the respondents a total of $112.50. Based upon the parties\u2019 computations, the trial court determined that the petitioner owed interest and a 5% penalty for a portion of April 2011, and all of May, June, and July 2011, for a total of $16,891.88. The court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>subtracted from this amount the $15,000 the petitioner paid to defer the foreclosure, and, thus, ordered him to pay the respondents $1,891.88. The trial court denied the respondents\u2019 claim for attorney\u2019s fees and costs. This appeal and cross-appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">\n<em>II. Respondents\u2019 Appeal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">\n<em>A. Unjust Enrichment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">The respondents first argue that the trial court erred when it found that they would be unjustly enriched if the petitioner were required to pay \u201camounts that came due during the time that ownership of the loan was in dispute.\u201d \u201cThe propriety of affording equitable relief in a particular case rests in the sound discretion of the trial court.\u201d <em>Axenics, Inc. v. Turner Constr. Co., </em>164 N.H. 659, 669 (2013) (quotation omitted). Consequently, we review a trial court\u2019s equitable determination for an unsustainable exercise of discretion. <em>Id. </em>\u201cAlthough the award of equitable relief is within the sound discretion of the trial court, that discretion must be exercised, not in opposition to, but in accordance with, established principles of law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">The respondents argue that unjust enrichment is not available as a remedy here because the underlying loan agreement and promissory note \u201ccontrolled and remained in full force and effect.\u201d (Capitalization and bolding omitted.) They are correct. Unjust enrichment is an equitable remedy that is available when an individual receives \u201ca benefit which would be <em>unconscionable </em>for him to retain.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). \u201cIt is not a boundless doctrine, but is, instead, narrower, more predictable, and more objectively determined than the implications of the words unjust enrichment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). \u201cOne general limitation is that unjust enrichment may not supplant the terms of an agreement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This is so because \u201crestitution is subordinate to contract as an organizing principle <em>of </em>private relationships, and the terms of an enforceable agreement normally displace any claim of unjust enrichment within their reach.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation, ellipsis, and brackets omitted); <em>see </em>Restatement (Third) of Restitution and Unjust Enrichment \u00a7 2 comment c at 17 (2011). Thus, a \u201ccourt cannot allow recovery under a theory of unjust enrichment when there is a valid, express contract covering the subject matter at hand.\u201d <em>Axenics, </em>164 N.H. at 669.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-9\">Here, the dispute over the ownership of the loan agreement and promissory note did not eliminate the petitioner\u2019s obligations under them. Under the loan agreement and promissory note, the petitioner was required to pay $4,875 monthly. There was never a dispute regarding the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>petitioner\u2019s obligation to make those payments; the dispute was about to whom the payments should be made. Under those circumstances, contrary to the trial court\u2019s decision, the petitioner\u2019s obligation to make the payments was not tolled. Because the loan agreement and note remained viable, it was error for the trial court to have afforded the petitioner a remedy under an unjust enrichment theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">The petitioner argues that he was entitled to such a remedy because \u201cthere is no language in the loan agreement which in any way addresses the series of events that led to [his] unjust enrichment claim here.\u201d He asserts that neither the loan agreement nor the promissory note directed \u201cthe parties on the appropriate behavior when the loan was, for all intents and purposes, simply frozen for a period of eighteen months, when not two, but three different parties were fighting over ownership of the Note and demanding payments, and where the borrower, attempting to get out of the exceptionally high interest rate associated with this bridge loan, simply was unable to obtain conventional financing.\u201d Thus, he reasons, this case fits within an exception to the general rule that one may not recover under an unjust enrichment theory when there is a valid contract in place that pertains to the same subject matter. <em>See id. </em>at 669-70. Here, he argues, \u201cthere was no agreement in place\u201d during the time in which ownership of the loan and note were in dispute, \u201cand thus, no basis for [the] respondents\u2019 demanded retroactive interest, among other charges and penalties.\u201d Under those circumstances, he asserts, the respondents\u2019 demands \u201cwere outside the scope of the agreement,\u201d which makes unjust enrichment an available remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">The exception to which the petitioner refers allows contracting parties to recover under an unjust enrichment theory when \u201cthe benefit received is outside the scope of the contract.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 670. Here, to the contrary, the benefit the petitioner received \u2014 use of the money loaned to him under the loan agreement \u2014 is the very subject of the loan agreement. Similarly, the benefit the respondents were entitled to receive \u2014 the petitioner\u2019s interest-only payments \u2014 is the very subject of the promissory note. The fact that the loan agreement and promissory note were silent with respect to the course the petitioner should take if a dispute arose about the ownership of those obligations, \u201cdoes not open the door for a quasi-contract remedy.\u201d <em>Anwar v. Fairfield Greenwich Ltd., </em>831 F. Supp. 2d 787, 796-97 (S.D.N.Y. 2011) (deciding, under Florida law, that \u201cthe Form Contract\u201d precluded the plaintiffs from recovering under an unjust enrichment theory even though that contract was silent with regard to the \u201cextreme contingency\u201d raised in their lawsuit).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>\n<em>B. Payment of $450,000</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">The respondents next argue that the trial court erred when it applied the petitioner\u2019s payment of $450,000 to principal instead of to interest. They contend that the court\u2019s determination is contrary to the promissory note, which provides that \u201c[a]ll payments . . . shall be applied first to charges and/or fees, if any, then to accrued interest. . . , then to principal.\u201d The petitioner counters that the respondents\u2019 argument is \u201cillogical given the circumstances under which the preliminary injunction order was entered and payment made.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">The trial court made its decision with regard to the payment of $450,000 in connection with its conclusion that the petitioner was entitled to a remedy under an unjust enrichment theory. Because we cannot determine how the trial court would have ruled upon this issue had it not considered relief under that equitable theory, and because, given the nature of the parties\u2019 arguments, resolving this issue requires fact finding that must be done by the trial court in the first instance, we vacate this part of its order and remand for further proceedings. On remand, the trial court shall consider the merits of the respondents\u2019 assertion that the promissory note, in fact, required that the payment be applied first to charges and/or fees or accrued interest before being applied to principal.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">\n<em>C. Evidence of Petitioner\u2019s Experience with Similar Loans</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b224-8\">The respondents next contend that the trial court erroneously excluded evidence of the petitioner\u2019s experience with similar loans. On the first day of trial, the respondents asked the court to review the petitioner\u2019s responses to their requests for admission and to rule upon the validity of his objections thereto. The petitioner objected to several requests on relevancy grounds, and the court upheld those objections. The respondents argue that in so doing, the trial court erred. However, the respondents have not provided either their requests for admission or the petitioner\u2019s responses as part of the record on appeal. It is the burden of the respondents, as the parties appealing the trial court\u2019s decision on this issue, to provide a sufficient record. <em>See Bean v. Red Oak Prop. Mgmt., </em>151 N.H. 248, 250 (2004); <em>see also </em>Sup. Ct. R. 13. Absent the requests for admission and the petitioner\u2019s responses, we must assume that the record supports the trial court\u2019s determination that the requests at issue sought irrelevant information. <em>See Bean, </em>151 N.H. at 250.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-9\">\n<em>D. Delinquency Charge</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b224-10\">The respondents next argue that the trial court erroneously precluded them from recovering a 5% delinquency charge on the petitioner\u2019s late <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>lump sum payment of principal because that charge was not disclosed properly within the meaning of RSA 399-B :2. RSA 399-B :2 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-5\">Any person engaged in the business of extending credit shall furnish to each person to whom such credit is extended, concurrently with the consummation of the transaction or agreement to extend credit, a clear statement in writing setting forth the finance charges, expressed in dollars, rate of interest, or monthly rate of charge, or a combination thereof, to be borne by such person in connection with such extension of credit as originally scheduled.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">\u201c \u2018Finance charges\u2019 includes charges such as interest, fees, service charges, discounts, and other charges associated with the extension of credit.\u201d RSA 399-B :1, II (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">The loan agreement provided that in the event that the petitioner defaulted, the lender could \u201cimpose... a delinquency charge as set forth in the Note.\u201d The note stated that the lender could impose \u201ca delinquency charge at the rate of Five percent (5%) on each installment of principal and/or interest not paid on or before fifteen (15) calendar days after such installment is due.\u201d The petitioner also received a \u201cSTATEMENT OF FINANCE CHARGESfc] NEW HAMPSHIRE RSA 399-B\u201d (emphasis omitted), which provided, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-8\">The interest rate is to be fixed at Thirteen Percent (13%) per annum for One (1) Year from the date of the Note. During the term of the Note, payment of principal and interest shall be made in monthly installments of $4,875.00 each.. .. The amount of the monthly payments will always be sufficient to repay interest only and at the conclusion of the One (1) Year period[,] the principal, plus all accrued interest, fees and expenses of the loan shall be payable in full. On May 1, 2010, the principal balance and any accumulated interest shall be due and payable in full. All payments made under the Note shall be applied first to charges and/or fees, if any, then to accrued interest at the rate stated above, then to principal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-9\">In addition, Lender may impose upon the Borrower a delinquency charge at the rate of Five Percent (5%) on each installment of interest not paid on or before fifteen (15) calendar days after such installment is due.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-10\">The trial court concluded that the delinquency charge was a \u201cfinance charge\u201d within the meaning of RSA 399-B:l, II, and, therefore, pursuant to RSA 399-B :2, had to be disclosed in a \u201cclear statement in writing,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>furnished to the petitioner \u201cconcurrently with\u201d the loan agreement and promissory note. The trial court further concluded that the respondents failed to provide a \u201cclear statement\u201d to the petitioner that the 5% delinquency charge would apply to principal payments because the RSA chapter 399-B statement of finance charges stated that the delinquency charge was a charge \u201con each installment of interest,\u201d while the promissory note stated that it was a charge \u201con each installment of principal and/or interest.\u201d The court decided that, although the documents made clear that a delinquency charge applied to the monthly interest-only payments, they did not make clear that such a charge also applied to the lump sum payment of principal. Thus, the trial court ruled that, pursuant to the statement of finance charges, the respondents were entitled to collect a delinquency charge only on delinquent monthly interest payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">The respondents first argue that the trial court erred by determining that the delinquency charge constituted a \u201cfinance charge\u201d within the meaning of RSA 399-B :1, II. \u201cWe are the final arbiter of the intent of the legislature as expressed in the words of the statute considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Frost v. Comm\u2019r, N.H. Banking Dep\u2019t, </em>163 N.H. 365, 374 (2012). \u2018When examining the language of the statute, we ascribe the plain and ordinary meaning to the words used.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u2018We interpret.legislative intent from the statute as written and will not consider what the legislature might have said or add language that the legislature did not see fit to include.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u2018We also interpret a statute in the context of the overall statutory scheme and not in isolation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We review issues of statutory interpretation <em>de novo. Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">Here, we agree with the trial court that the delinquency charge is a \u201cfinance charge\u201d within the meaning of RSA 399-B :1, II because it is a \u201ccharge\u201d associated with the respondents\u2019 \u201cextension of credit\u201d to the petitioner. RSA 399-B:l, I\u00cd. The respondents assert that because such a charge on the petitioner\u2019s lump sum payment would be incurred only <em>\u201cafter </em>the loan was scheduled to be repaid,\u201d it is not a \u201cfinance charge\u201d that had to be disclosed. We are not persuaded. <em>See DeCato Brothers, Inc. v. Westinghouse Credit Corp., </em>129 N.H. 504, 508-09 (1987) (holding that a prepayment penalty constituted a finance charge within the meaning of RSA 399-B.T, II, and that the failure to disclose such a penalty in a clear statement in writing violated RSA 399-B:2).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\"> Alternatively, the respondents argue that the promissory note and statement of finance charges satisfied RSA 399-B :2 with regard to imposing a delinquency charge on the petitioner\u2019s lump sum payment of principal. We disagree. As the trial court observed, \u201c[c]onflicting disclosures cannot satisfy RSA 399-B:2\u2019s stated requirement of providing \u2018a clear statement\u2019 because conflicting information is by its very nature unclear.\u201d Here, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>information provided to the petitioner made clear that the delinquency charge would apply to his monthly interest-only payments. However, that information did not make clear that the charge would also apply to his lump sum payment of principal. Accordingly, the trial court did not err when it allowed the respondents to recover a 5% penalty on delinquent interest payments, but precluded them from recovering a 5% penalty on the delinquent lump sum payment of principal.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">\n<em>E. Attorney\u2019s Fees and Costs</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">Finally, the respondents argue that the trial court erroneously disallowed recovery of their reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs. After the bench trial, the trial court ordered the parties to \u201cprovide . . . their respective computations of total amounts paid to date and outstanding amounts due.\u201d In complying with that order, the respondents included their reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs in their \u201ccomputation of... outstanding amounts due.\u201d Specifically, they sought $77,836 in fees and costs associated with defending against the petitioner\u2019s action and $25,945 in fees and costs associated with their collection and foreclosure action.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">The trial court ruled that the respondents were not entitled to recover <em>any </em>of their fees and costs. The court first decided that the respondents had not established a basis for recovery of fees and costs. The court rejected their assertion that section 14.3 of the loan agreement allowed them to recover their fees and costs. The court concluded that this provision did not apply because \u201c[t]his was not a collection action commenced by the respondents,\u201d but rather was a petition for \u201can injunction and other relief and commenced by the borrower.\u201d The trial court did not separately address the $25,945 that the respondents incurred in bringing their foreclosure action. Alternatively, the trial court concluded that, even if section 14.3 of the loan agreement applied, the respondents had \u201cfailed to demonstrate that the amount sought is reasonable and does not encompass amounts claimed elsewhere in the table of amounts claimed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">The respondents first assert that the trial court erred when it impliedly ruled that section 14.3 of the loan agreement did not allow them to recover the fees and costs incurred in the foreclosure action. \u201cAn award of attorney\u2019s fees must be grounded upon statutory authorization, a court rule, an agreement between the parties, or an established exception to the rule that each party is responsible for paying his or her own counsel fees.\u201d <em>In the Matter of Hampers &amp; Hampers, </em>154 N.H. 275, 289 (2006) (quotation omitted). We review the trial court\u2019s interpretation of section 14.3 of the loan agreement <em>de novo, </em>giving the language used by the parties its reasonable meaning. <em>See In the Matter of Liquidation of Home Ins. Co., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>157 N.H. 548, 546 (2008). We review the trial court\u2019s actual award of attorney\u2019s fees under our unsustainable exercise of discretion standard. <em>Id. </em>at 290.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">Section 14.3 of the loan agreement provides: \u201cBorrower shall pay all costs, expenses, charges, including attorney\u2019s fees, incidental to or relating to the Loan and to the collection thereof and to the foreclosure of the Loan Documents ...\u201d The fees and costs that the respondents incurred in bringing their foreclosure action are expressly encompassed in this provision. Accordingly, the trial court unsustainably exercised its discretion by ruling that those fees and costs were not recoverable pursuant to section 14.3 of the loan agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">The respondents next argue that the trial court erred when it determined that section 14.3 does not allow them to recover their attorney\u2019s fees and costs incurred in the instant proceeding initiated by the petitioner. The trial court interpreted this provision to allow the respondents to recover their attorney\u2019s fees and costs <em>only </em>in a collection proceeding and/or foreclosure action that they initiated. However, the plain meaning of the provision allows the respondents to recover their attorney\u2019s fees and costs in any action that is <em>\u201cincidental to or relating to </em>the Loan and to the collection thereof and to the foreclosure of the Loan Documents.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">The instant proceeding, although initiated by the petitioner, relates to the loan and its collection and to the respondents\u2019 foreclosure action. The petitioner\u2019s petition sought: (1) a declaration regarding whether he owed the amounts the respondents claimed he owed on the loan; (2) a declaration regarding whether the respondents had the right to foreclose on the property; (3) a declaration regarding whether the loan agreement was valid; (4) disgorgement of \u201call applicable interest[ ], costs, and attorneys\u2019 fees\u201d the respondents \u201cunjustly obtained and unconscionably retained\u201d pursuant to the loan agreement and promissory note; and (5) damages for the respondents\u2019 allegedly unlawful conduct in brokering the loan. Because the petition relates to the loan and its collection and to the respondents\u2019 foreclosure action, section 14.3 of the loan agreement entitles the respondents to recover the reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs they have incurred in this proceeding. We hold, therefore, that the trial court\u2019s determination that section 14.3 does not apply to the fees and costs the respondents incurred in this proceeding constitutes an unsustainable exercise of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">The respondents next contend that' the trial court erred when it concluded that they had failed to demonstrate that the fees and costs they incurred were reasonable. The trial court found \u201cseveral penalties on late interest payments\u201d were included in the $77,836 the respondents claimed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>for fees and costs incurred in the instant proceeding. Our review of the record on appeal does not support this finding. Accordingly, we cannot uphold it.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">In light of the trial court\u2019s errors with regard to the attorney\u2019s fees and costs claimed by the respondents, we vacate its order denying them, and remand for it to reconsider the respondents\u2019 request for fees and costs. On remand, the court may hold such further proceedings upon the respondents\u2019 request as it may deem necessary, consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">\n<em>III. Petitioner\u2019s Cross-Appeal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">The petitioner cross-appeals the trial court\u2019s determination that the respondents\u2019 conduct did not violate the CPA. The petitioner argues that the respondents violated the CPA because, despite competing claims of ownership, they demanded that he make payments under the promissory note and initiated a collection and foreclosure action. The petitioner further asserts that the respondents acted unfairly because they rejected his offer to settle the matter and insisted that he pay what he owed under the loan agreement and promissory note. The trial court rejected these arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">We will uphold the trial court\u2019s findings of fact and rulings of law unless they lack evidentiary support or constitute a clear error of law. <em>Axenics, </em>164 N.H. at 675. Under RSA 358-A:2, \u201c[i]t shall be unlawful for any person to use any unfair method of competition or any unfair or deceptive act or practice in the conduct of any trade or commerce within this state.\u201d We have previously recognized that, although this provision is broadly worded, not all conduct in the course of trade or commerce falls within its scope. <em>Id. </em>\u201cAn ordinary breach of contract claim, for example, is not a violation of the CPA.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). In determining which commercial actions not specifically delineated are covered by the CPA, we have employed the \u201crascality\u201d test. <em>Id. </em>Under the rascality test, \u201cthe objectionable conduct must attain a level of rascality that would raise an eyebrow of someone inured to the rough and tumble of the world of commerce.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 675-76 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-9\">Here, we agree that the respondents did not violate the CPA by: (1) requiring the petitioner to honor his obligations under the loan agreement and promissory note; (2) enforcing their rights under those documents by initiating a collection and foreclosure action upon his default; and (3) rejecting his offer of compromise. These actions do not, as a matter of law, \u201craise an eyebrow of someone inured to the rough and tumble of the world of commerce.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). Accordingly, we find no error in the trial court\u2019s rejection of the petitioner\u2019s CPA claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>\n<em>IV. Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">For all of the reasons we have discussed, we affirm the trial court\u2019s: (1) exclusion of evidence of the petitioner\u2019s experience with similar loans; (2) determination that the respondents cannot collect a $22,500 delinquency charge on the petitioner\u2019s lump sum payment of principal; and (3) conclusion that the respondents\u2019 actions did not violate the CPA. We reverse the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the petitioner was entitled to a remedy under an unjust enrichment theory. Additionally, we vacate the trial .court\u2019s determination that the petitioner\u2019s payment of $450,000 should be applied to principal and its decision not to award the respondents any of their claimed attorney\u2019s fees and costs. We remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">\n<em>Affirmed in part; reversed in part; vacated in part; and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b230-7\">Hicks, Conboy, Lynn, and Bassett, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
