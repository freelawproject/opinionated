We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-15\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b728-16\">The following facts are derived from the trial court\u2019s orders or are otherwise drawn from the record. In June 2012, after the parties had been married for more than 30 years, the petitioner filed for a no-fault divorce. At the time, the parties lived in separate residences at the same address.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-17\">On the night of December 4,2012, the respondent went to the petitioner\u2019s residence with a box that contained a gun and told her that he was going to' use the gun. An argument ensued. The respondent then yelled at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>petitioner, pursued her through the home, grabbed her by the hair, threw her against a counter, choked her, slammed a door on her, and pushed her to the floor. According to the petitioner, the respondent had also \u201chit [her] plenty of times\u201d in the past, including in June 2012 when the respondent had \u201chit [her] across the face and dislocated [her] jaw.\u201d The respondent denied that the abuse occurred, and testified that, on December 4, the petitioner hit him with an umbrella and fell after tripping over a pair of boots.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">The next day, the petitioner reported the incident to the police. At that time, she did not tell the police about the gun, press criminal charges against the respondent, or seek a protective order. Later that day, the parties had dinner together at a restaurant. On December 6, they drove together to Manchester for mediation regarding their pending divorce.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">On December 7, the petitioner filed a domestic violence petition in which she described the incident that occurred in her home three days earlier. The court issued a temporary domestic violence protective order and scheduled a final hearing for later that month. On December 27, the petitioner wrote to the police, seeking to press charges against the respondent arising out of the December 4 incident. Criminal charges were subsequently filed against the respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-7\">During the next year, at the respondent\u2019s request, the trial court repeatedly continued the final hearing in the domestic violence case. In December 2013, the trial court ordered that the hearing be rescheduled for \u201cafter October 1, 2014\u201d when \u201cthe [respondent\u2019s] criminal matters have been resolved.\u201d Nonetheless, on January 24, 2014, the trial court, <em>sua sponte, </em>vacated its earlier scheduling order and ordered that the matter be set for a final hearing. The court observed that, although the \u201cstatutory framework envisions a final hearing within 30 days of the filing of the petition,\u201d the final hearing had \u201cbeen continued multiple times\u201d and 14 months had passed since the date of the petition. The final domestic violence hearing was scheduled for March 6, 2014, the same day as the hearing on the merits in the parties\u2019 divorce.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-8\">On March 6, the day of the scheduled hearings, the respondent moved to recuse Judge <em>Carbon </em>from both the domestic violence and the divorce proceedings. He argued that recusal was required from both proceedings because the accountant who was scheduled to testify on the respondent\u2019s behalf during the divorce proceeding also provided financial services to Judge <em>Carbon. </em>The respondent asserted that, although the accountant \u201cw[ould] not testify in the domestic violence proceeding,\u201d an \u201cintegral connection\u201d existed between the domestic violence and the divorce proceedings such that Judge <em>Carbon </em>was required to recuse herself from both proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>Following oral argument, Judge <em>Carbon </em>recused herself from the divorce proceeding, observing that the \u201cCourt could be accused of either giving undue preference to, or undervaluing the quality of, [the accountant\u2019s] testimony\u201d during the divorce hearing. However, she denied the motion seeking her recusal from the domestic violence proceeding, explaining that there was \u201cno conflict of interest, nor any appearance of possible bias resulting from a shared professional when that person has no role whatsoever\u201d in the domestic violence case. Accordingly, Judge <em>Carbon </em>presided over the March 6 domestic violence hearing, and the parties\u2019 divorce proceeding was assigned to another judicial officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">After the domestic violence hearing, the respondent filed a motion to dismiss the domestic violence petition, arguing that \u201cthe petition fail[ed] to allege conduct that could reasonably be construed to be abuse under RSA 173-B.\u201d The trial court denied the motion and granted a final domestic violence protective order. The trial court credited the petitioner\u2019s testimony and concluded \u201cthat Respondent has committed acts of abuse including simple assault (grabbing [petitioner\u2019s] hair, choking her, pushing her to the ground), in addition to threatening her with a firearm and restraining her movement. These are acts of abuse pursuant to RSA 173-B.\u201d The court also found that, given the \u201clong history of abuse\u201d and the fact that the \u201cparties are involved in a contentious divorce,\u201d the respondent presented \u201ca credible threat to Petitioner\u2019s on-going safety.\u201d This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b730-7\">The respondent first contends that, because the accountant\u2019s appearance as a witness in the divorce proceeding created an appearance of impropriety, Judge <em>Carbon </em>erred by not recusing herself from the domestic violence proceeding. Pursuant to the Code of Judicial Conduct, \u201c[a] judge shall act at all times in a manner that promotes public confidence in the independence, integrity, and impartiality of the judiciary, and shall avoid impropriety and the appearance of impropriety.\u201d SUP. Ct. R. 38, Canon 1.2. Thus, \u201cthe Code of Judicial Conduct requires disqualification of a judge in a proceeding in which the judge\u2019s impartiality might reasonably be questioned and to avoid even the appearance of impropriety.\u201d <em>Miller v. Blackden, </em>154 N.H. 448, 456 (2006); <em>see </em>SUR Ct. R. 38, Canon 2.11. \u201cWhether an appearance of impropriety exists is determined under an objective standard, <em>ie., </em>would a reasonable person, not the judge [her]self, question the impartiality of the court.\u201d <em>Miller, </em>154 N.H. at 456 (quotation omitted). \u201cThe test for the appearance of partiality is an objective one, that is, whether an objective, disinterested observer, fully informed of the facts, would entertain significant doubt that justice would be done in the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b731-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>The respondent argues that Judge <em>Carbon\u2019s </em>disqualification from the domestic violence proceeding was required because an appearance of impropriety existed due to the accountant\u2019s \u201crole in this case\u201d as a witness in the divorce proceeding \u201cand his current employment by the presiding fact finder.\u201d The respondent maintains that, once Judge <em>Carbon </em>recused herself from the divorce proceeding, she should have recused herself from \u201cthe case in its entirety,\u201d including the domestic violence proceeding, because \u201crecusal on any portion of the proceedings demands complete separation from the case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">In response, the petitioner argues that Judge <em>Carbon </em>did not err because the accountant had \u201cabsolutely no role\u201d in the domestic violence proceeding. The petitioner asserts that the parties\u2019 divorce is distinct from the domestic violence proceeding and that the respondent erroneously conflates the two. The petitioner also contends that the respondent waived his recusal argument because he waited until the day of the hearings to file the motion. Assuming, without deciding, that the respondent did not waive his recusal argument, we conclude that recusal was not required.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">We initially observe that we need not decide whether the respondent is correct in asserting that recusal from one portion of a case requires recusal from the remainder of that case because his argument is premised upon an incorrect characterization of the domestic violence proceeding and the divorce proceeding as components of a single case. Rather, the proceedings are two separate cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-7\">First, we note that the petitioner sought a divorce based upon the ground of irreconcilable differences, and not based upon fault. <em>See </em>RSA 458:7-a (Supp. 2014). Consequently, the petitioner did not need to demonstrate one of the fault-based grounds, such as the \u201c[e]xtreme cruelty of either party to the other,\u201d or that \u201ceither party has so treated the other as seriously to injure health or endanger reason.\u201d RSA 458:7, III, V (2004); <em>cf. </em>RSA 458:7-a. Therefore, in contrast to a fault-based divorce in which the outcome of a domestic violence proceeding could be relevant to the trial court\u2019s consideration of the fault-based grounds, in the context of a no-fault divorce \u2014 as we have here \u2014 the outcome of a domestic violence proceeding is of little or no relevance.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-8\">Furthermore, RSA 458:7-a provides that \u201c[i]n any pleading or hearing of a petition\u201d for a no-fault divorce, \u201callegations or evidence of specific acts of misconduct shall be improper and inadmissible, except where parental rights and responsibilities are an issue ... or at a hearing where it is determined by the court to be necessary to establish the existence of irreconcilable differences.\u201d However, neither exception is applicable here. Accordingly, allegations and evidence of specific acts of misconduct in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>case would be improper and inadmissible, and the outcome in the domestic violence proceeding would not have had any impact on the divorce proceeding or the terms of the divorce decree. <em>See </em>RSA 458:7-a; <em>see also In the Matter of Nassar &amp; Nassar, </em>156 N.H. 769, 774 (2008) (stating that, in a no-fault divorce, fault is not considered on question of property division or alimony).</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">Further, we observe that a different docket number was assigned to each proceeding, and that the trial court did not consolidate the proceedings. <em>Cf. Town of Nottingham v. Bonser, </em>146 N.H. 418, 426 (2001) (concluding that the fraud matter and the underlying zoning matter were the same case for purposes of Superior Court Rule 168 because, although the two had different docket numbers, \u201cthe cases more closely resembled bifurcated issues of a single matter\u201d and the parties and the trial court treated them as a single case). Notably, the domestic violence proceeding here \u2014 in which the petitioner sought a protective order \u2014 served a very different purpose than the divorce proceeding. Moreover, although the two proceedings involved the same parties, different legal criteria and procedures applied in the two matters. <em>Compare </em>RSA ch. 173-B (governing domestic violence), <em>with </em>RSA ch. 458 (2004 &amp; Supp. 2014) (governing, among other things, divorce). <em>See also State v. Bader, </em>148 N.H. 265, 269-70 (2002) (\u201cWhile the civil and criminal cases were grounded in the same facts, they cannot be equated, and the defendant\u2019s argument ignores the different standards and burdens of proof germane to each.\u201d). Given these important differences, we conclude that the two proceedings are separate and are not- \u2014 contrary to the respondent\u2019s argument \u2014 different components of the same case.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">The respondent also argues that, even if the two proceedings- are separate, our decision in <em>Blaisdell v. City of Rochester, </em>135 N.H. 589 (1992), required that Judge <em>Carbon </em>recuse herself from both proceedings. In <em>Blaisdell, </em>we held that a trial judge should have disqualified himself from a case in which he was \u201crelated within the third degree to a partner in a law firm representing a party-in-interest before that judge.\u201d <em>Blaisdell, </em>135 N.H. at 592. Although that judge made no rulings in \u201ctwo later related cases,\u201d we vacated orders issued by other judges in the subsequent cases because of the \u201cpervasive appearance of partiality in the original case\u201d and the fact that the original judge\u2019s rulings \u201cwere an integral part of the two later related cases.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 594.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-7\">However, <em>Blaisdell </em>is distinguishable. Unlike the judge in <em>Blaisdell </em>who failed to recuse himself despite the \u201cappearance of partiality [that] permeate[d] the [original] proceeding,\u201d <em>id., </em>Judge <em>Carbon </em>recused herself from the divorce proceeding upon learning about the accountant\u2019s role in that proceeding. Thus, in contrast to <em>Blaisdell, </em>any appearance of impro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>priety that may have existed in the divorce proceeding no longer existed as a result of Judge <em>Carbon\u2019s </em>recusal. Accordingly, our decision in <em>Blaisdell </em>to vacate subsequent orders stemming from the \u201cpervasive appearance of partiality in the original case,\u201d <em>id., </em>has no application here.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">The respondent also argues that an appearance of impropriety existed when Judge <em>Carbon </em>presided over the domestic violence final hearing after recusing herself from the parties\u2019 divorce. Although \u201cthe Code of Judicial Conduct requires disqualification of a judge in a proceeding in which the judge\u2019s impartiality might reasonably be questioned and to avoid even the appearance of impropriety!,] \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 [t]he test for the appearance of partiality is an objective one, that is, whether an objective, disinterested observer, fully informed of the facts, would entertain significant doubt that justice would be done in the case.\u201d <em>Miller, </em>154 N.H. at 456 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">Here, it was the accountant\u2019s role as a witness in the divorce proceeding that caused Judge <em>Carbon </em>to recuse herself from that proceeding. However, because the accountant was not to be involved in the domestic violence proceeding in any manner, we conclude that a disinterested observer, <em>fully informed of the facts, </em>would not, in fact, entertain doubt that justice would be done. <em>See id. </em>at 455-56 (concluding that the trial judge did not err in failing to recuse himself because, although the judge had previously recused himself from cases involving the defendant\u2019s business partner, the present case did not involve that business partner). Accordingly, we hold that Judge <em>Carbon </em>did not err by denying the motion to recuse herself from the domestic violence proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b733-8\">The respondent next argues that the trial court erred when it <em>sua sponte </em>vacated the continuance that it had previously granted, and ordered that the domestic violence matter be scheduled for a final hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-9\">\u201cThe trial court has broad discretion in managing the proceedings before it.\u201d <em>In the Matter of Sawyer &amp; Sawyer, </em>161 N.H. 11, 18 (2010) (quotation omitted). \u201cWe review a trial court\u2019s rulings in this area under an unsustainable exercise of discretion standard.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). \u2018We will disturb decisions about motions to continue only if the [respondent] demonstrates that the decision was clearly unreasonable to the prejudice of his case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation and ellipsis omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b733-10\">The respondent asserts that the court \u201cunsustainably exercised its discretion when ordering the Respondent to move forward -with the domestic violence proceeding before the underlying criminal assault charges were concluded.\u201d He contends that the court\u2019s decision to acceler<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>ate the final domestic violence hearing \u201cforced [him] to abandon his Fifth Amendment rights\u201d in order to \u201cdefend himself from the allegations in the domestic violence proceeding.\u201d Relying upon federal case law, he further argues that the trial court should have utilized a multi-factor balancing test to determine whether the case should have been continued. <em>See Microfinancial, Inc. v. Premier Holidays Intern., </em>385 F.3d 72, 78 (1st Cir. 2004). He contends that the factors identified in <em>Microfinancial </em>weighed in favor of continuing the domestic violence hearing until the criminal proceedings had concluded. Finally, the respondent asserts that, because the 30-day time period for scheduling hearings following the filing of a domestic violence petition, <em>see </em>RSA 173-B:3, VII (2014), is designed to protect only the interests of the party against whom the protective order was issued, and since he did not object to a further continuance, the trial court erred when it moved the final hearing forward.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">As the petitioner correctly observes in her brief, we previously rejected an argument that is nearly identical to that which the respondent now makes regarding his Fifth Amendment rights. <em>See In re Melissa M., </em>127 N.H. 710, 712 (1986). The respondent has not persuaded us to reach a different result in this case. \u201cThere is no constitutional right to a stay of a civil proceeding pending disposition of a related criminal case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe law thus recognizes the principle .that protection of the public interest may often require proceeding simultaneously on two fronts, and that it would unduly compromise the public interest to force the government to choose between a civil and criminal course of action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). Additionally, continuing the domestic violence final hearing until the conclusion of the respondent\u2019s criminal proceedings \u2014 including any appeals \u2014 would have fostered delay, and thus contravened the high priority that the legislature has placed upon avoiding delay in domestic violence cases. <em>See Knight v. Maher, </em>161 N.H. 742, 744-45 (2011) (stating that the purpose of RSA chapter 173-B is to preserve and protect the family unit by \u201centitling victims of domestic violence to <em>immediate </em>and effective police protection and judicial relief\u2019 (quotation omitted; emphasis added)). Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s decision to hold the final hearing in March was not an unsustainable exercise of its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">Equally unavailing is the respondent\u2019s assertion that a multi-part balancing test, which is utilized by some federal courts, <em>see, e.g., Microfinancial, Inc., </em>385 F.3d at 78, should be employed in New Hampshire when a court \u201ceneounter[s] [a] civil continuance request[ ] because of [a] parallel or related criminal proceeding.\u201d We have never required the use of such a test. As we have stated, \u201c[t]he trial court has broad discretion in managing the proceedings before it,\u201d and \u201c[w]e review a trial court\u2019s rulings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>[regarding motions to continue] under an unsustainable exercise of discretion standard.\u201d <em>In the Matter of Sawyer &amp; Sawyer, </em>161 N.H. at 18 (quotations omitted). Accordingly, the trial court\u2019s failure to employ a test that we have never required is not an unsustainable exercise of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">Nor are we persuaded by the respondent\u2019s argument that the 30-day time period for domestic violence hearings protects <em>only </em>his interests. The respondent correctly notes that RSA 173-B :3, VII contemplates that, generally, a domestic violence hearing be held \u201cwithin 30 days of the filing of [the] petition ... or within 10 days of service of process upon the [respondent], whichever occurs later.\u201d However, the respondent\u2019s argument that this statutory timeframe protects only <em>his </em>interests ignores the broader purpose of RSA chapter 173-B. Although it is true that the 30-day timeframe set forth in RSA 173-B-.3, VII protects the respondent\u2019s right to timely challenge the restraints placed upon him by another\u2019s allegations, <em>see McCarthy v. Wheeler, </em>152 N.H. 643, 646 (2005), that timeframe also promotes the overall purpose of RSA chapter 173-B of \u201centitling victims of domestic violence to immediate and effective police protection and judicial relief,\u201d <em>Knight, </em>161 N.H. at 744-45 (quotation omitted). Accordingly, we conclude that the respondent has failed to satisfy his burden to show that the trial court unsustainably exercised its discretion when it vacated its previous scheduling order and scheduled the domestic violence hearing for March 6, 2014.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b735-7\">The respondent next argues that there was insufficient evidence presented at the final hearing to support entry of a final domestic violence protective order. <em>See </em>RSA 173-B-.5 (2014). Relying primarily upon our decision in <em>Tosta v. Bullis, </em>156 N.H. 763 (2008), the respondent maintains that the petitioner \u201cdid not sustain her burden of proof that Respondent\u2019s conduct constituted an <em>ongoing </em>credible threat of harm\u201d because \u201cthe sole basis for her petition was an event that had occurred fourteen months\u201d before the March 2014 final hearing. He further asserts that, given the petitioner\u2019s actions subsequent to the December 4, 2012 incident \u2014 including having dinner with him on December 5 and then traveling with him to the mediation the following day \u2014 the trial court erred in concluding that his actions constituted \u201cabuse\u201d that warranted entry of a final domestic violence protective order. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-8\">We review sufficiency of the evidence claims as a matter of law, and uphold the findings and rulings of the trial court unless they are lacking in evidentiary support or tainted by error of law. <em>Tosta, </em>156 N.H. at 767; <em>see </em>RSA 173-B:3, VI (2014). \u201cWhen performing this review, we accord considerable weight to the trial court\u2019s judgments on the credibility of witnesses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>and the weight to be given testimony.\u201d <em>Tosta, </em>156 N.H. at 767 (brackets and quotation omitted). \u201cWe view the evidence in the light most favorable to the [petitioner].\u201d <em>Walker v. Walker, </em>158 N.H. 602, 608 (2009) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">\u201cTo obtain relief under RSA chapter 173-B, a [petitioner] must show \u2018abuse\u2019 by a preponderance of the.evidence.\u201d <em>Tosta, </em>156 N.H. at 767; <em>see </em>RSA 173-B:5,1 (Supp. 2014). \u201cAbuse\u201d is defined as having two elements: (1) commission or attempted commission of one or more of several criminal acts, <em>see </em>RSA 173-B:1, I(a)-(h) (2014); and (2) a finding that such misconduct \u201cconstitute[s] a credible present threat to the petitioner\u2019s safety,\u201d RSA 173-B:1,1. <em>See Walker, </em>158 N.H. at 608. The threshold misconduct that will support a finding of abuse need not immediately precede the filing of a domestic violence petition. <em>Tosta, </em>156 N.H. at 767. The threat posed by such conduct to a petitioner\u2019s safety, however, must be ongoing. <em>Id. </em>Incidents that are too distant in time and non-specific cannot support a finding of abuse under RSA chapter 173-B. <em>Walker, </em>158 N.H. at 608. Additionally, a petitioner must \u201cshow more than a generalized fear for personal safety based upon past physical violence and more recent non-violent harassment to support a finding that a credible threat to her safety exists.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">As to the first element, the trial court concluded that the petitioner \u201cprovided credible testimony of specific\u201d criminal acts that occurred during the December 4 incident. The trial court determined that these criminal acts included simple assault and threatening with a firearm when the respondent brought a gun to the petitioner\u2019s home, stated that he would \u201cuse it,\u201d and then grabbed the petitioner by her hair, choked her, and pushed her to the ground. <em>See </em>RSA 173-B:1; I(a)-(b). Although conflicting testimony was presented at the final hearing regarding the December 4 incident, \u201cwe accord considerable weight to the trial court\u2019s judgments on the credibility of witnesses and the weight to be given testimony.\u201d <em>Tosta, </em>156 N.H. at 767 (brackets and quotation omitted). We cannot conclude that the trial court erred in determining that sufficient evidence existed that the respondent committed one or more criminal acts against the petitioner on December 4. <em>See </em>RSA 173-B:1,1.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-7\">Regarding the second element, the respondent contends that, given the petitioner\u2019s actions in the days immediately following the December 4 incident, and the fact that the final hearing took place more than 14 months after the incident, the trial court erred in concluding that his \u201cconduct constituted an <em>ongoing </em>credible threat of harm.\u201d We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-8\">As a preliminary matter, the respondent asserts that the \u201cpresent credible threat\u201d determination must be made as of the time the domestic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>violence hearing takes place, and not as of the time that the petition was filed. Under the circumstances of this case, we need not resolve that issue. Regardless of whether the credible present threat determination is made as of the date of the final hearing or as of the date of the petition, there was sufficient evidence for the trial court to conclude that the respondent represented a credible present threat to the petitioner\u2019s safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">To support his argument, the respondent relies upon our decision in <em>Tosta. </em>In <em>Tosta, </em>we concluded that \u201cthere was insufficient evidence to support a finding that the [respondent] represented a credible threat to the [petitioner\u2019s safety at the time she filed [the] domestic violence petition\u201d because nine months had passed between the criminal misconduct and the filing of the petition, during which the parties lived together without physical violence. <em>Tosta, </em>156 N.H. at 768. We explained that the \u201clink between the [petitioner\u2019s request for protection and the [prior] assault was attenuated at best,\u201d and that the \u201conly conclusion supported by . . . the evidence . . . [was] that some other forces, as opposed to the . . . assault, prompted the [petitioner] to seek a restraining order.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We, therefore, concluded that the trial court erred in entering a final domestic violence protective order. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">The present case is readily distinguishable: in contrast to <em>Tosta, </em>where the petitioner filed <em>nine months </em>after the alleged misconduct, here the petitioner filed her petition <em>three days </em>after the December 4 incident. Although the petitioner testified that she went to dinner with the respondent the night after the incident and traveled with him to the mediation the following day, she also explained that: (1) the dinner occurred in a public place and they drove there separately; (2) she did not want to \u201cget [the respondent] angry\u201d by changing their prior arrangements of driving together to the mediation; and (3) because the respondent was the one driving to the mediation, she did not feel threatened during that trip. This is in contrast to <em>Tosta, </em>where the parties lived together without physical violence for nine months following the alleged misconduct. <em>See id.) of. Walker, </em>158 N.H. at 609 (distinguishing <em>Tosta </em>because, although the plaintiff stated that things between her and the defendant had been \u201cokay\u201d during the weekend preceding her petition, the plaintiff explained that they were at a family campground with 15-20 other people and she did not feel in immediate danger at that time).</p>\n<p id=\"b737-7\">Further, the petitioner in <em>Tosta </em>testified that \u201cthe [respondent\u2019s sudden and unexplained decision to <em>leave </em>her home, as opposed to his affirmative display of some threatening behavior,... ultimately prompted her to file for a protective order.\u201d <em>Tosta, </em>156 N.H. at 768 (emphasis in original). Here, in contrast, it was the respondent\u2019s misconduct on December 4, which included bringing a gun to the petitioner\u2019s home and choking her, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>prompted the petitioner to file the domestic violence petition three days later. <em>See Walker, </em>158 N.H. at 609 (similarly distinguishing <em>Tosta). </em>Accordingly, <em>Tosta </em>is not controlling here.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">We also disagree with the respondent\u2019s assertion that certain evidence was too stale for the trial court to consider. <em>See id. </em>at 608 (noting that incidents that are too stale cannot support a finding of abuse). The specific evidence to which the respondent refers is the petitioner\u2019s testimony at the domestic violence hearing that the respondent had \u201chit [her] plenty of times\u201d in the past, including on an occasion six months prior to the filing of the petition when the respondent had \u201chit [her] across the face and dislocated [her] jaw.\u201d Although it is true that these events occurred at least 14 months before the date of the final hearing, it is important to note that none of our cases have suggested a bright-line rule as to when an incident becomes too stale. <em>Compare Thompson v. D\u2019Errico, </em>163 N.H. 20, 23 (2011) (finding no error in the trial court\u2019s reliance upon, among other acts, an attempted, assault that occurred within six months of the filing of the petition), <em>with Fillmore v. Fillmore, </em>147 N.H. 283, 284-86 (2001) (holding that two incidents of physical abuse occurring eight and eleven years prior to the petition were too stale to show current abuse). Additionally, while the mere passage of time is a factor for a trial court to consider, the nature and extent of the alleged misconduct are also important considerations. Here, the events at issue were neither minor nor isolated; rather, they evidenced an ongoing pattern of violent behavior, which culminated in the December 4 incident. In light of these circumstances, we are not persuaded that this evidence was too stale for the trial court to consider.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">Accordingly, although more than a year had passed between the December 4 incident and the final hearing, given the serious nature of the incident and the \u201clong history of abuse\u201d as found by the trial court, we conclude that the trial court did not err when it determined that the respondent represented a credible present threat to the petitioner\u2019s safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-7\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b738-8\"> The respondent has waived his argument concerning the trial court\u2019s admission of certain testimony. Although he raised the issue in his notice of appeal, he failed to brief it. <em>See Waterfield v. Meredith Corp., </em>161 N.H. 707, 713 (2011) (concluding that \u201cany issues raised in the notice of appeal, but not briefed, are deemed waived\u201d). To the extent that the respondent asserts additional arguments, we conclude that they are not sufficiently developed to warrant judicial review. <em>See Stewart v. Bader, </em>154 N.H. 75, 78 (2006) (noting that a mere laundry list of complaints regarding adverse rulings by the trial court, without developed legal argument, is insufficient to warrant appellate review).</p>\n<p id=\"b739-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>Finally, the petitioner has requested that we award attorney\u2019s fees related to this appeal. We decline to do so because we conclude that the appeal has not \u201cbeen frivolous or in bad faith.\u201d SUP. Ct. R. 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b739-6\">DALIANIS, C.J., and CONBOY and Lynn, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
