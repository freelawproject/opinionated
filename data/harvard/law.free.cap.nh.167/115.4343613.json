We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-17\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b136-18\">The following facts were found by the PELRB or are supported by the record. The county is a public employer. <em>See </em>RSA273-A:!, X (2010). On July <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>13, 2012, the union filed a petition for certification with the PELRB, seeking approval of a bargaining unit comprised of certain employees of the Sheriffs Office. The PELRB subsequently approved a bargaining unit composed of the positions of deputy sheriff, dispatcher, and secretary. Following an election in December 2012, the union was certified as the bargaining unit\u2019s exclusive representative.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">As of July 13, 2012, Paul Rowe and Michael Lemoi were employed as deputies in the civil department of the Sheriffs Office. They both worked a schedule of four ten-hour days per week (4-10 schedule). Pursuant to contractual arrangements between the Sheriffs Office and the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Rowe and Lemoi, as well as other deputies, also performed work for ICE, such as transporting detainees involved in ICE proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">By September 2012, the county decided to establish two new full-time deputy positions dedicated to ICE work. The then-sheriff, Wayne Estes, discussed the new ICE positions with Rowe and Lemoi. Both deputies expressed interest in the positions, but only if their ICE work schedules consisted of five eight-hour work days per week (5-8 schedule). They sought 5-8 schedules for the ICE positions in order to maximize their potential for overtime earnings. However, both deputies preferred 4-10 schedules if they continued to work in the civil department, and neither deputy asked to have his civil department schedule changed to a 5-8 schedule.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">In October 2012, the sheriff proposed a schedule for the new ICE positions, which called for Rowe and Lemoi to work 4-10 schedules. Lemoi responded by e-mail and requested the 5-8 schedule that he believed had been previously agreed upon. He also requested to stay in the civil department if the 5-8 schedules would not be implemented for the ICE positions. In response, the sheriff notified Rowe and Lemoi that they would remain in the civil department, but that their work hours were being changed from 4-10 schedules to 5-8 schedules.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-8\">Deputy sheriffs also sometimes perform \u201coutside detail\u201d work. This work consists of providing law enforcement services to third parties, such as local police departments, which have need for extra personnel at certain times.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The county bills the third parties who engage deputies to perform outside detail work and then compensates the deputies by paying them a portion of the funds it receives. Although outside detail work is not part of a deputy\u2019s normal work day or schedule, prior to the time the union sought certifiea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>tion, the county paid deputies for outside detail work at a rate equal to their overtime compensation rate, regardless of whether they were otherwise eligible for overtime compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">Prior to the union\u2019s certification petition, the county also permitted deputies to include benefit time, such as holiday, vacation, and sick leave, in their hour totals for determining their eligibility for overtime pay for work in excess of 40 hours per week.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">In the summer of 2012, the United States Department of Labor (DOL) completed an investigation into possible violations of the federal Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) by the Sheriffs Office, based on its wage and hour practices during the previous two years. The DOL investigator summarized his findings in a letter to the county, which stated in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-7\">The investigation found violations of FLSA section 7 resulting from your failure to pay statutory overtime pay for hours worked in excess of 40 p\u00e9r week. Specifically, you failed to include federal [ICE] hours into the total work hours of non-exempt employees when computing overtime pay for hours worked in excess of 40 per week. As a result, the employees were paid at their regular hourly rate of pay with no additional half-time premium for hours worked in excess of 40 per week.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-8\">The investigation further found violations of FLSA section 11 resulting from your failure to keep an accurate record of all hours worked for non-exempt employees. Specifically, you failed to retain an accurate record of hours worked per day and per week by all non-exempt employees for 2010.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-9\">As a result of these violations, five employees were found due back wages totaling $4,812.17.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b138-10\">After the union filed its certification petition on July 13, 2012, the county discontinued both established practices of paying the overtime rate for outside detail work regardless of the number of hours worked, and of including benefit time when computing hours worked for purposes of overtime compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-11\">In November 2012, the union filed a complaint with the PELRB, alleging that the county committed an unfair labor practice, in violation of RSA 273-A:5, 1(a), (b), (c), and (g), by changing the terms and conditions of employment of proposed bargaining unit members after the union petitioned to act as the unit\u2019s exclusive representative for purposes of collective bargaining. Following a hearing, the PELRB determined that the county \u201ccommitted an unfair labor practice because it failed to maintain the status quo during the pendency of bargaining unit formation and representation election proceedings.\u201d The PELRB decided that the three changes made \u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>to the deputies\u2019 schedules, to the rate of pay for outside detail work, and to the manner in which overtime was calculated \u2014 were all mandatory subjects of bargaining that -the county could not unilaterally change once the union filed its certification petition. The PELRB ordered the county to \u201crestore the affected employees to the status quo ante that existed as of the filing of the certification petition and make them whole.\u201d The PELRB denied the county\u2019s motion for rehearing, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">RSA chapter 541 governs our review of PELRB decisions. <em>See </em>RSA 273-A:14 (2010); RSA 541:2 (2007). We will not set aside the PELRB\u2019s order except for errors of law, unless, we are satisfied, by a clear preponderance of the evidence, that it is unjust or unreasonable. RSA 541:13 (2007). The PELRB\u2019s findings of fact are presumed <em>prima facie </em>lawful and reasonable. <em>Id. </em>In reviewing the PELRB\u2019s findings, \u201cour task is not to determine whether we would have found differently than did the [PELRB], or to reweigh the evidence, but rather to determine whether the findings are supported by competent evidence in the record.\u201d <em>Appeal of Dean Foods, </em>158 N.H. 467, 474 (2009) (quotation omitted). We review the PELRB\u2019s rulings on issues of law <em>de novo. See Appeal of Portsmouth Regional Hosp., </em>148 N.H. 55, 57 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b139-8\">The county first contends that it did not violate the status quo doctrine when the sheriff changed Rowe\u2019s and Lemoi\u2019s work schedules. It argues that the status quo was that the sheriff retained the prerogative to determine deputies\u2019 work schedules; therefore, when the sheriff altered the schedules, there was no change in the status quo and, accordingly, no unfair labor practice. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-9\">\u201cMaintenance of the status quo demands that all terms and conditions of employment remain the same during collective bargaining.\u201d <em>Appeal of City of Nashua Bd. of Educ., </em>141 N.H. 768, 772 (1997) (quotation omitted). \u2018We have explained that the status quo doctrine derives from RSA 273-A:3, I, which imposes the obligation to negotiate in good faith over the terms of employment, and from RSA 273-A:5, . . . which makes it an unfair labor practice for a public employer to refuse to negotiate in good faith.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A public employer\u2019s \u201cunilateral change in a term or condition of employment!,] <em>whether during negotiations for an initial [collective bargaining agreement] </em>or during a status quo period following expiration of a CBA[,] is tantamount to a refusal to negotiate that term and destroys the level playing field necessary for productive and fair labor negotiations.\u201d <em>Id. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>(emphasis added; quotation and parentheses omitted). However, \u201cthe status quo doctrine is limited by its rationale. Thus, an employer is prohibited from making unilateral changes on <em>mandatory </em>subjects of collective bargaining, but not on <em>permissive </em>topics of collective bargaining.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 772-73. \u201c[A] unilateral change in the former is an unlawful refusal to engage in required negotiation, but a unilateral change in the latter is generally a legitimate exercise of discretion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 773 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">RSA273-A:1, XI (Supp. 2013) defines the \u201c \u2018[tjerms and conditions of employment\u2019 \u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-6\">[Wjages, hours and other conditions of employment other than managerial policy within the exclusive prerogative of the public employer, or confided exclusively to the public employer by statute or regulations adopted pursuant to statute. The phrase \u201cmanagerial policy within the exclusive prerogative of the public employer\u201d shall be construed to include but shall not be limited to the functions, programs and methods of the public employer, including the use of technology, the public employer\u2019s organizational structure, and the selection, direction and number of its personnel, so as to continue public control of governmental functions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">To determine whether the county had a managerial prerogative to change the deputies\u2019 work schedules, we apply a \u201cthree-step analysis for measuring a particular proposal or action against the managerial policy exception.\u201d <em>Appeal of City of Nashua Bd. of Educ., </em>141 N.H. at 773. \u201cFirst, to be negotiable, the subject matter of the proposed contract provision must not be reserved to the exclusive managerial authority of the public employer by the constitution, or by statute or statutorily adopted regulation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 773-74 (quotation omitted). \u201cSecond, the proposal must primarily affect the terms and conditions of employment, rather than matters of broad managerial policy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 774 (quotation omitted). \u201cThird, if the proposal were incorporated into a negotiated agreement, neither the resulting contract provision nor the applicable grievance process may interfere with public control of governmental functions contrary to the provisions of RSA 273-A:l, XI.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">Applying this three-step analysis to the present case, we conclude that the deputies\u2019 scheduling was a mandatory subject of bargaining that the county could not unilaterally change after the union filed its petition. <em>See id. </em>at 772 (noting that a public employer\u2019s \u201cunilateral change in a term or condition of employment... <em>during negotiations for an initial CBA ... </em>is tantamount to a refusal to negotiate that term and destroys the level <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>playing field necessary for productive and fair labor negotiations\u201d (emphasis added; quotation omitted)); <em>see also Piggly Wiggly, Tuscaloosa Div., etc. v. N.L.R.B., </em>705 F.2d 1537, 1538-39 (11th Cir. 1983) (describing the \u201c \u2018critical period\u2019 \u201d during which unfair labor practices may occur under the National Labor Relations Act as beginning \u201cwhen a representation petition is filed\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\">First, the parties here fail to identify any <em>\u201cindependent </em>statute, or any constitutional provision or valid regulation, that reserves to the [county] the exclusive authority\u201d to alter the deputies\u2019 work schedules. <em>Appeal of City of Nashua Bd. of Educ., </em>141 N.H. at 774. Instead, the county refers to the deputies\u2019 hiring letters and a \u201cspecifically designated policy of the Sheriffs department\u201d that allegedly reserved for the sheriff the \u201cexclusive right to set work schedules of deputies.\u201d Even assuming that this policy was in place, the county fails to argue, or present any evidence, that such a policy was codified in any constitution, statute, or regulation. <em>See id. </em>Therefore, we proceed to the second step in the analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">We also conclude that the change in schedules \u201cprimarily affect[s] the terms and conditions of employment, rather than matters of broad managerial policy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As previously noted, RSA 273-A:l, XI defines the terms and conditions of employment to specifically include \u201cwages, <em>hours </em>and other conditions of employment.\u201d (Emphasis added.) \u201c[0]ur cases have consistently recognized proposals and actions that primarily affect wages or <em>hours </em>as mandatory subjects of bargaining.\u201d <em>Appeal of City of Nashua Bd. of Educ., </em>141 N.H. at 775 (emphasis added). Additionally, \u201ca public employer\u2019s \u2018greater\u2019 power to create or eliminate a position or program does not necessarily include the \u2018lesser\u2019 power to unilaterally determine wages and hours for the position or program.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, the change in Rowe\u2019s and Lemoi\u2019s hours of work in the civil department from 4-10 to 5-8 schedules primarily affected the terms and conditions of the deputies\u2019 employment. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">Finally, we \u201cconclude that if this proposal were incorporated into a negotiated agreement, the resulting contract provision would not interfere with public control of governmental functions.\u201d <em>Appeal of Town of North Hampton, </em>166 N.H. 225, 231 (2014). Preventing the county from unilaterally altering the deputies\u2019 schedules after the union\u2019s petition was filed \u201cdoes not present the type of problem we have identified in this context: hindering or impeding a public employer\u2019s authority to establish policy, standards, or criteria for disciplinary action.\u201d <em>Appeal of City of Nashua Bd. of Educ., </em>141 N.H. at 775; <em>see Appeal of White Mts. Regional School Bd., </em>125 N.H. 790,794 (1984) (noting that a \u201cunilateral action to change hours of work\u201d is \u201cforbid[den]\u201d). Because the changes in the deputies\u2019 schedules <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>satisfy all three steps of the analysis, the changes are mandatory subjects of collective bargaining. <em>See Appeal of City of Nashua Bd. of Educ., </em>141 N.H. at 774.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">Nonetheless, the county argues that the sheriff did not violate the status quo doctrine by changing the work schedules of Rowe and Lemoi subsequent to the filing of the union\u2019s petition because the sheriff had exercised the authority to establish and change work schedules before the petition was filed. Although the letters by which Rowe and Lemoi were originally offered employment stated that \u201c[t]he Sheriff reserves the right to adjust working hours,\u201d the evidence before the PELRB concerning the manner in which the sheriff actually exercised his scheduling authority prior to the filing of the petition was conflicting, and supports the PELRB\u2019s finding that the sheriff \u201cwas indifferent to whether the Deputies worked a 5-8 or a 4-10 schedule.\u201d In these circumstances, we cannot say that the PELRB\u2019s determination that the county violated the status quo doctrine, and thereby committed an unfair labor practice, by unilaterally altering the deputies\u2019 schedules, over their objection, following the filing of the union\u2019s petition was unsupported by the evidence or legally erroneous.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See id. </em>at 774-76. Therefore, the PELRB\u2019s decision on this point is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">Turning to the changes to the pay rate for the outside detail work and the way in which overtim\u00e9 was calculated, the union correctly notes that the county does not argue on appeal that these two changes did not involve mandatory subjects of bargaining. Therefore, any claim of error predicated on this ground is waived. <em>See Aubert v. Aubert, </em>129 N.H. 422, 428 (1987) (\u201cArguments not briefed <em>are </em>waived on appeal.\u201d). Accordingly, we cannot conclude that the PELRB erred in determining that the county committed an unfair labor practice by violating the status quo when it made these two unilateral changes after the union filed its certification petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-8\">Nevertheless, the county maintains that it was justified in making these two changes because of the DOL investigation. It contends that it had \u201cno choice but to comply with\u201d what it \u201cunderstood to be mandated\u201d by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>DOL, and, thus, that it changed these practices to avoid possible future fines and penalties that could have been imposed by the DOL.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">We are not persuaded. Even assuming that the county actually made the changes in response to the DOL investigation, \u201cthe FLSA sets only minimum standards, a floor, not the maximum amount an employer may agree to pay.\u201d <em>U.S. Dept. of Air Force v. F.L.R.A., </em>952 F.2d 446, 455 (D.C. Cir. 1991) <em>(Randolph, </em>J., dissenting); <em>see also Rogers v. City of Troy, New York, </em>148 F.3d 52, 57 (2d Cir. 1998) (\u201cThe FLSA sets a national \u2018floor\u2019 in terms of working conditions, in order to protect workers from the substandard wages and excessive hours that might otherwise result from the free market. Parties may, of course, contract for additional rights above those guaranteed by the statute.\u201d). Apart from its apparent misunderstanding, then, nothing prevented the county from continuing to pay the increased outside detail wage and continuing to include benefit time when computing overtime wages, as these were simply wages and benefits greater than what the FLSA required. Therefore, we conclude that the county has not met its burden of demonstrating that the PELRB erred in finding that these changes constituted an unfair labor practice. <em>See </em>RSA 541:13.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">The county also asserts that the PELRB erred by failing to properly account for county policy regarding overtime calculations. It maintains that the county \u201chad a countywide overtime policy that was part of its Employee Manual\u201d and that the DOL investigation \u201cbrought to light the conflict between the Sheriff\u2019s department and all other county employees ... with respect to the calculation of overtime.\u201d At bottom, the county contends that, because the way the sheriff had been calculating overtime prior to the filing of the union\u2019s petition violated county policy, the status quo doctrine should not require it to continue to violate that policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">We decline to consider this argument. \u201cIt is the burden of the appealing party, here the [county], to provide this court with a record sufficient to decide [its] issues on appeal.\u201d <em>Bean v. Red Oak Prop. Mgmt., </em>151 N.H. 248, 250 (2004). However, in its briefs, the county fails to cite any evidence in the record to support its contention that such a county policy existed. And although the county referenced a portion of its alleged policy in its motion for rehearing filed with the PELRB, it acknowledged in that motion that \u201c[additional testimony and exhibits are necessary to clarify the existing personnel policies (status quo) of the County and the corresponding authority and responsibilities of the Board of County Commissioners vis-a-vis the Sheriff with respect to establishing and implementing personnel policies.\u201d In essence, the county\u2019s motion asked the PELRB to permit it to reopen the hearing and allow it to present additional evidence, without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>making any showing as to why such evidence could not have been presented at the original hearing. The PELRB was under no obligation to grant such a request, and the county has not demonstrated that the board unsustainably exercised its discretion in failing to do so. <em>Cf. Brown v. John Hancock Mut. Life Ins. Co., </em>131 N.H. 485, 492 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">Finally, the county notes that the PELRB made no finding of retaliation or improper motive by the sheriff in changing the deputies\u2019 schedules, the pay rate for the outside detail work, and the manner in which overtime compensation was calculated. The county argues that such a finding is a necessary prerequisite to an unfair labor practice. In support of its position, the county cites <em>Hudon v. City of Manchester, </em>141 N.H. 420, 424 (1996) (\u201cWe have recognized that a claim under RSA 273-A:5 requires evidence of a retaliatory or discriminatory motive on the part of the public employer.\u201d); <em>Appeal of Sullivan County, </em>141 N.H. 82, 88-89 (1996) (stating that \u201cthe union must prove some minimal degree of illegal motivation on the part of the employer to commit an unfair labor practice before the PELRB can find that RSA 273-A:5, 1(a) or (b) has been violated\u201d); and <em>Appeal of Prof. Firefighters of E. Derry, </em>138 N.H. 142,145 (1993) (noting that to establish an unfair labor practice under RSA 273-A:5, one \u201cmust prove by a preponderance of the evidence some element of retaliatory action\u201d). These cases are easily distinguishable from this case, however, because none of them involved an employer making a unilateral change to the terms and conditions of employment after a petition for certification of a bargaining unit had been filed with the PELRB, as occurred here.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">Additionally, in our recent decision in <em>Appeal of Town of North Hampton, </em>we concluded that \u201ca finding of anti-union animus was not necessary\u201d for the PELRB to determine that the public employer \u201ccommitted an unfair labor practice by unilaterally setting the wage and other conditions of employment.\u201d <em>Appeal of Town of North Hampton, </em>166 N.H. at 233. In that case, we reasoned that a \u201cunilateral <em>change </em>in a condition of employment is equivalent to a refusal to negotiate that term and destroys the level playing field necessary for productive and fair labor negotiations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). For the same reason, we reject the county\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>argument here that the PELRB erred in finding an unfair labor practice without making findings of retaliation or improper motive on the part of the county. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b145-5\">Dalianis, C.J., and Hicks, Conboy, and Bassett, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b137-9\"> For example, deputies have regularly worked outside details for the Durham Police Department during the University of New Hampshire\u2019s yearly homecoming weekend.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b142-9\"> To the extent that the county invites us to adopt the reasoning and outcome of <em>Marion Cty. Law Enf. Assn. v. Marion Cty., </em>883 P.2d 222 (Or. Ct. App. 1994), we decline the invitation. That case involved a collective bargaining agreement that explicitly provided the employer with the \u201cdiscretion to change the work schedule\u201d of the employees as necessary. <em>Marion Cty. Law Enf. Assn., 888 P.2d </em>at 225. Since that written agreement was the \u201cbasis for determining the status quo,\u201d when the employer changed the employees\u2019 schedules pursuant to that agreement, the court concluded that \u201cthere was no change in the status quo and, hence, no unfair labor practice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, however, there was no explicit written collective bargaining agreement (expired or otherwise) that reserved to the sheriff the right to set work schedules. Thus, this case and <em>Marion Cty. </em>are readily distinguishable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b144-8\"> As the union correctly observes, in <em>Appeal of Sullivan County, </em>the employer both decided to make the changes at issue and provided notice of its decision to do so to prospective bargaining unit members before the filing of the petition for certification. <em>See Appeal of Sullivan County, </em>141 N.H. at 88.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
