B., II (father), appeals an order of the Circuit Court <em>(Stephen, </em>J.) terminating his parental rights over his son, G. B., Ill (child). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-20\">The following facts were found by the trial court or are supported by the record. In September 2008, the father was arrested after making arrangements with an undercover state trooper to pay to have the child\u2019s mother, Michelle H., murdered. The father pleaded guilty to a class A felony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>indictment for criminal solicitation to commit murder as principal and/or accomplice. <em>See </em>RSA 629:2 (2007), 626:8 (2007). He is currently serving an eight-to-twenty-year prison sentence, with an early release date of August 16, 2016.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">On September 2, 2009, Michelle H. died. It appears that at that point, guardianship over the child was granted to either his maternal grandfather, or both of his maternal grandparents, although no certificate of appointment appears in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">In February 2012, the petitioners, Robert H. and his wife Carolyn H., petitioned for guardianship over the child. The record indicates that Robert is Michelle H.\u2019s cousin. In their <em>ex parte </em>motion to grant their petition for guardianship, the petitioners alleged that the child\u2019s grandfather had been hospitalized after suffering a massive heart attack and was unable to care for the child. They also alleged that the child\u2019s grandmother was unable to care for him due to \u201cher own medical problems and limitations.\u201d The petitioners were appointed temporary guardians on February 15, 2012. According to the report of the guardian ad litem (GAL) in this case, the child\u2019s grandfather died in February 2012 and his grandmother died in July of that year; in the meantime, in March 2012, the petitioners were appointed permanent- guardians.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">On or about July 13, 2012, the petitioners filed a petition against the father for termination of parental rights (TPR) over the child on grounds of abandonment; failure to support, educate or care for the child; and conviction of attempt or solicitation to murder Michelle H. <em>See </em>RSA 170-C:5, I, II, VII(c) (2014). The petitioners alleged that they wished to adopt the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">The trial court terminated the father\u2019s parental rights on grounds of attempt to commit murder and failure to support, educate and care for the child. The father appeals, arguing that: (1) the trial court lacked jurisdiction to terminate his parental rights; (2) the petitioners did not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the father failed to support the child despite being financially able to do so; (3) the evidence did not support termination of the father\u2019s parental rights on the ground of abandonment; and (4) termination of the father\u2019s parental rights was not in the child\u2019s best interest when it was contrary to his deceased mother\u2019s wishes and was not necessary for the child\u2019s welfare.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-9\">\u201cA court may not order the termination of parental rights unless the petitioning party proves a statutory ground for termination beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>In re Deven O., </em>165 N.H. 685, 689 (2013). \u201cWe will not disturb a trial court\u2019s finding that a ground for termination has been proved unless it is unsupported by the evidence or plainly erroneous as a matter of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 693. \u201cAfter the court finds statutory grounds for termination, it must further consider whether termination is in the [child\u2019s] best interest.\u201d <em>In re Zachary G., </em>159 N.H. 146, 157 (2009). Such a determination requires assessment of which of the possible alternative dispositional orders is the most desirable, under a standard giving priority to the assumed interest of the child. <em>Id. </em>\u201cWe will not disturb the trial court\u2019s finding unless unsupported by the evidence or plainly erroneous as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Finally, whether the circuit court had subject matter jurisdiction in this case is a question of law subject to <em>de novo </em>review. <em>In the Matter of Mallett &amp; Mallett, </em>163 N.H. 202, 207 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">The father first argues that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to terminate his parental rights because the child had been residing in Massachusetts with Robert and Carolyn since they obtained temporary guardianship over him in February 2012. The father relies upon RSA 170-C.-3, which provides, in pertinent part: \u201cThe probate court shall have exclusive <em>original </em>jurisdiction over petitions to terminate the parent-child relationship when the child involved is present in the state or is in the legal custody or legal guardianship of an authorized agency located in the state.\u201d RSA 170-C:3 (2014) (emphasis added); <em>see also </em>RSA 490-F:3 (Supp. 2013) (providing, in part, that \u201c[t]he circuit court shall have the jurisdiction, powers, and duties conferred upon the former probate . . . courts\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">It appears that the father correctly contends that neither of the conditions upon which jurisdiction under RSA 170-C:3 could be predicated \u2014 physical presence or the requisite custody or guardianship \u2014 existed at the time the petition for termination of parental rights was filed. Nevertheless, the petitioners assert that \u201c[t]he applicable statutory authority is the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction [and] Enforcement Act (UCCJEA).\u201d <em>See </em>RSA ch. 458-A (Supp. 2013) (Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act as adopted in New Hampshire). They assert two grounds supporting jurisdiction under the UCCJEA: (1) that the circuit court \u201chas exercised jurisdiction over and entered several orders concerning the legal custody and legal guardianship of [the child] from 2009 until . . . the court order to terminate parental rights . . . [which is] the subject of this appeal\u201d; and (2) that New Hampshire is the child\u2019s \u201chome state\u201d under the UCCJEA as of the date of filing the petition to terminate the father\u2019s parental rights. <em>See </em>RSA 458-A:l, VII. Because we agree that the first basis supports jurisdiction under the UCCJEA, we decline to address the second. In addition, as this case presents an issue of first impression, we look to decisions of other jurisdictions for guidance.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">The UCCJEA governs when a court of this state has jurisdiction to make or modify a child custody determination. <em>See </em>RSA 458-A:12-:15. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>\u201cChild custody determination\u201d is defined, in relevant part, to mean \u201ca judgment, decree, or other order of a court providing for the legal custody, physical custody, or visitation with respect to a child.\u201d RSA 458-A:l, III. We hold that a TPR decision is a child custody determination for purposes of the UCCJEA. <em>See </em>RSA 458-A:l, IV (defining \u201c[c]hild-custody proceeding\u201d to mean, in relevant part, \u201c[a] proceeding in which legal custody, physical custody, or visitation with respect to a child is an issue . . . including] a proceeding for . . . termination of parental rights\u201d); <em>In re Welfare of Children of D.M.T.-R., </em>802 N.W.2d 759, 763 (Minn. Ct. App. 2011) (stating that \u201c[u]nder the UCCJEA, a \u2018child custody determination\u2019 includes determinations made in . . . TPR proceedings\u201d); <em>In re J.C.B., </em>209 S.W.3d 821, 824 (Tex. App. 2006) (noting that \u201cactions to terminate parental rights fall within the scope of child custody determinations\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">The TPR decision in this case was not the initial child custody determination for purposes of the UCCJEA. <em>See </em>RSA 458-A:l, VIII (defining \u201c[i]nitial determination\u201d to mean \u201cthe first child-custody determination concerning a particular child\u201d). The initial child custody determination was the appointment of the child\u2019s maternal grandfather, or both maternal grandparents, as his guardian(s) following Michelle H.\u2019s death. Although we were not provided the certificate of appointment, references in the record to a Merrimack Family Division 2009 docket number indicate, and the parties do not dispute, that the initial custody determination was made by a New Hampshire court. Accordingly, we must determine whether the circuit court retained jurisdiction, pursuant to the UCCJEA, to make a TPR determination with respect to the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">RSA 458-A:13,1 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-7\">I. Except as otherwise provided in RSA 458-A:15 [dealing with temporary emergency jurisdiction], a court of this state which has made a child-custody determination consistent with RSA458-A:12 [providing for jurisdiction to make initial child-custody determination] or RSA 458-A:14 [dealing with jurisdiction to modify a child custody determination made by a court of another state] has exclusive, <em>continuing </em>jurisdiction over the determination until:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-8\">(a) A court of this state determines that neither the child, nor the child and one parent, nor the child and a person acting as a parent have a significant connection with this state and that substantial evidence is no longer available in this state concerning the child\u2019s care, protection, training, and personal relationships; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>(b) A court of this state or a court of another state determines that the child, the child\u2019s parents, and any person acting as a parent do not presently reside in this state.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">RSA 458-A:13, I (emphasis added). We note that for purposes of the UCCJEA, the TPR determination in this case is considered a modification of the previous guardianship determinations because it was \u201cmade after a previous determination concerning the same child.\u201d RSA 458-A:l, XI (defining \u201cModification\u201d to mean \u201ca child-custody determination that changes, replaces, supersedes, or is otherwise made after a previous determination concerning the same child, whether or not it is made by the court that made the previous determination\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">It has not been demonstrated that any of the determinations enumerated in subparagraphs (a) or (b) have been made in this case. As the petitioners argue, the child \u201chad resided [in New Hampshire] for at least the five years previous to filing the subject Petition For Termination Of Parental Rights, except for the 5 months [in Massachusetts] with [the petitioners] . . : . Virtually all of the information relating to the child is located in New Hampshire.\u201d Thus, the circuit court had continuing jurisdiction. In addition, as the father is presently incarcerated in New Hampshire, he still resides here.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">We note that this case is nearly on all fours with <em>In re H.L.A.D., </em>646 S.E.2d 425 (N.C. Ct. App. 2007), <em>aff'd, </em>655 S.E.2d 712 (N.C. 2008), in which the court summarized its principal holding as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-8\">When a court of this State, in an initial custody order, awards custody of a child to custodial guardians who thereafter move out of North Carolina, the courts of this State maintain exclusive, continuing jurisdiction pursuant to the Uniform Child-Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act when the guardians file a petition, in a separate action, for the termination of parental rights.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b124-9\"><em>In re H.L.A.D., </em>646 S.E.2d at 428.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-10\">In <em>H.L.A.D., </em>the father appealed the termination of his parental rights over his daughter, arguing that because the child resided out of state when the petition was filed, the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction under a statute that provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-11\">\u201c[T]he court shall have <em>exclusive original jurisdiction </em>to hear and determine any petition or motion relating to termination of parental rights to any juvenile who resides in, is found in, or is in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>the legal or actual custody of a county department of social services or licensed child-placing agency in the district at the time of the filing of the petition or motion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b125-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 429 (quoting N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 7B-1101 (2005) (amended 2007)). The appellate court affirmed, concluding that the trial court had exclusive, continuing jurisdiction under the UCCJEA. <em>See id. </em>at 432. Noting the distinction between exclusive, original jurisdiction and exclusive, continuing jurisdiction, the court explained that the grant of exclusive, original jurisdiction to the district court under N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 7B-1101, \u201cwhen the circumstances specified' [in that statute] . . . exist[,] . . . does not preclude the district court\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction in circumstances in which the court already has \u2018exclusive, continuing jurisdiction\u2019 pursuant to the UCCJEA.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 430.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">We similarly note that RSA 170-C:3 and RSA 458-A:13, I, independently grant jurisdiction under the circumstances set forth in each. That jurisdiction under one is not supported on a given set of facts does not preclude jurisdiction under the other. We conclude that the trial court had continuing subject matter jurisdiction under RSA 458-A:13,1, to terminate the father\u2019s parental rights over the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\"> We address the father\u2019s next two arguments together. He contends that the petitioners did not prove beyond a reasonable doubt the statutory TPR grounds of failure to support and abandonment. We need not determine whether these grounds were proved, however, because the trial court found that a third ground was proved, and the father does not challenge that finding on appeal. Specifically, the court found that \u201ca statutory basis exists under [RSA 170-C:5, VII(c)] which includes attempt to commit murder.\u201d We find it to be of no moment that the court cited attempt rather than solicitation to commit murder, the latter being the offense of which the father stands convicted, because both offenses are included in RSA 170-C:5, VII(c) and the father\u2019s record of conviction adequately supports the solicitation ground. We further note that in his motion for reconsideration before the trial court, the father stated: \u201cAs to the Court\u2019s finding that [the father\u2019s] rights may be terminated under the grounds as set forth in .. . [RSA 170-C:5, VII(c)] he concedes that he has no defense to those particular grounds.\u201d Because a TPR \u201cpetition may be granted where the court finds that <em>one </em>or more\u201d of the listed statutory grounds exist, RSA 170-C:5 (2014) (emphasis added), the father\u2019s second and third contentions on appeal, even if true, would provide no basis for reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>Finally, the father argues that the best interest of the child does not support terminating the father\u2019s parental rights. His challenge is essentially two pronged: first, he contends that termination was contrary to Michelle H.\u2019s wishes, and, second, he argues that termination was not necessary to protect the child\u2019s welfare. We address each in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">The father asserts that Michelle H., \u201cbefore her death, wanted the child to have an ongoing relationship with his father\u201d and \u201cencouraged and promoted this relationship by frequently transporting the child to prison, by making known the importance of the relationship in her letters, and by arranging escorts to transport the child to prison when she was too ill to do so herself.\u201d He argues that \u201c[i]n determining the child\u2019s best interests, the mother\u2019s wishes for her child should carry considerable weight, especially where the child\u2019s security and safety are intact.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">We decline to determine what, if any, weight a mother\u2019s wishes for her child should be given in a best interest analysis. Rather, we reiterate our well settled law that \u201c[t]he dominant consideration in termination proceedings ... is the welfare of the child, <em>which prevails over the interests of the </em>parents.\u201d <em>In re Adam R., </em>159 N.H. 788, 792 (2010) (emphasis 'added). \u201cThe conclusion of what is in the child\u2019s best interest. .. concerns which of the possible alternative dispositional orders is the most desirable, <em>under a standard giving priority to the assumed interest of the child!\u2019 In re Shannon M., </em>146 N.H. 22, 28 (2001) (emphasis added) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">The trial court acknowledged that \u201cMichelle wanted [the father and the child] to have a relationship.\u201d The court noted that \u201cafter [the father\u2019s] incarceration the record demonstrates that Michelle attempted to reconcile with [him] and felt it was important that [the child] be in his life to some degree.\u201d The court found, however, that \u201ca lot has changed since that time.\u201d Specifically, the child was \u201cthriving\u201d in the home of the petitioners, with whom, the GAL found, he was \u201c \u2018very, bonded.\u2019 \u201d The court noted that the child was doing well in school and was involved in sports and scouts. It also noted the GAL\u2019s observation that the child was a \u201chappy child\u201d who \u201cvery much wants to be adopted by the [petitioners]. He explains his reasons simply and eloquently: they take care of me, they love me and I love them.\u201d (Quotations omitted.) The father has shown no error in the trial court\u2019s implicit finding that the child\u2019s interests prevailed over the acknowledged wishes of his mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">The father finally contends that termination of his parental rights was not necessary to protect the child\u2019s \u201csafety, security, and welfare\u201d where the father had consented to the petitioners\u2019 guardianship of the child and he is \u201cnot seeking to undo [the] guardianship\u201d when he is released from prison. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>The father specifically challenges, as unsupported by the evidence, the following observation in the trial court\u2019s order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-5\">[T]he Court is gravely concerned for the welfare of [the child] if he is placed in [the father\u2019s] custody after he is released from prison. It will be very difficult for [the father] when he is released. It will be difficult for him to find employment and/or redevelop his trade and build clientele. He will face obstacles which may create financial burdens especially on someone raising a young child.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">The father argues that \u201c[t]he record does not show that the child will be placed in the father\u2019s custody; on the contrary the record shows that the father supported the permanent guardianship and upon his release did not intend to contest the guardianship.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b127-8\">The father likens this case to <em>In re William A., </em>142 N.H. 598 (1998), in which we held that the termination of the mother\u2019s parental rights was not necessary to ensure a stable and secure environment for the child, who was in the custody of his natural father and the father\u2019s wife. <em>In re William A., </em>142 N.H. at 600. The father in <em>William A. </em>sought to terminate the mother\u2019s parental rights so that his wife could adopt the child. <em>Id. </em>Nevertheless, the wife \u201cexpressed a willingness to permit visitation between [the child and the mother]\u201d and the father \u201cindicated that he, too, would be willing to allow [the mother] continued visitation with [the child], provided that the visits occurred at his home.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In addition, the mother consented to the stepmother\u2019s appointment as the child\u2019s legal guardian. <em>Id. </em>at 602. In concluding that termination of the mother\u2019s parental rights was not necessary to ensure the child\u2019s stable and secure environment, we stated that \u201c[t]he record does not reflect any effort by [the mother] to reacquire legal or physical custody of her son. She merely wanted the right to visit him. The GAL testified that such visitation was consistent with [the child\u2019s] best interests, and the stepmother supported this view.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 601.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-9\">The facts of this case differ. The father did not \u201ccontinuously giv[e] the child to other persons for long periods of time to care for,\u201d <em>id. </em>(quotation omitted), as did the mother in <em>William A., see id. </em>at 599 (noting that the first such placement by mother, shortly after child\u2019s birth, was with family friends nearby so she could finish high school); rather, he solicited another to murder the child\u2019s mother. As the trial court stated: \u201c[T]here are some decisions in life one makes that have significant consequences. The decision to hire someone to murder your child\u2019s mother is one of those examples, especially when coupled with all the other factors in this case calling for termination.\u201d In addition, here, in contrast to <em>William A., </em>the GAL opined that \u201cit is in [the child\u2019s] best interests to terminate his father\u2019s rights and that he be adopted by\u201d the petitioners.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>Finally, as for the record \u201cnot showing] that the child will be placed in the father\u2019s custody,\u201d but, rather, showing that the father, \u201cupon his released did not intend to contest the guardianship,\u201d we note that the father\u2019s testimony indicated only that he did not intend to seek custody right away. He acknowledged that it would take him some time after his release from prison to \u201creestablish [his] life and be capable of caring for [the child],\u201d and that he would \u201cbe on parole for a considerable amount of time.\u201d He then concluded: \u201cSo <em>initially </em>I wouldn\u2019t be seeking any kind of having custody of him when I got out.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Accordingly, we find no error in the trial court voicing its concern about the possibility of the father having custody of the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">Ultimately, the trial court was required to determine \u201cwhich of the possible alternative dispositional orders is the most desirable.\u201d <em>In re Shannon M., </em>146 N.H. at 28 (quotation omitted). The court found that the child was flourishing in his \u201cpre-adoptive home\u201d with the petitioners, a home that it noted \u201cappears to be a loving environment and offers the best opportunity to provide a solid foundation for [the child\u2019s] future.\u201d The court also found that \u201c[t]hrough the love and support of [the petitioners], [the child] is in a family that offers him the best chance of future success.\u201d We are not persuaded that the trial court\u2019s best interest finding is \u201cunsupported by the evidence or plainly erroneous as a matter of law.\u201d <em>In re Zachary G., </em>159 N.H. at 157.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b128-7\">Dalianis, C.J., and Conboy, Lynn, and Bassett, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
