Mutrie. In its order, the trial court concluded that the reckless and wanton conduct in which Mutrie was alleged to have engaged \u2014 knowingly permitting her son to engage in criminal activity on her property \u2014 did not constitute an \u201coccurrence\u201d as required for coverage under the homeowner\u2019s and umbrella insurance policies issued to Mutrie by Amica (the Policies). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-12\">The following facts are drawn from the trial court\u2019s order and the record, or are otherwise undisputed. The intervenors are four police officers who served on a drug task force. On April 12, 2012, the intervenors executed a search warrant at a property in Greenland where Mutrie\u2019s son lived. The property is owned by a trust, of which Mutrie is the trustee. The warrant was issued because there was probable cause that Mutrie\u2019s son was engaged in criminal activity. During the execution of the search warrant, Mutrie\u2019s son opened fire, wounding the intervenors. Mutrie\u2019s son then turned the gun on himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-13\">The intervenors filed a civil suit against Mutrie in July 2012. They alleged that Mutrie was responsible for their injuries because, \u201cwith the knowledge, information, and belief\u2019 that her son was engaged in criminal activity, she \u201cdid recklessly and wantonly allow... criminal activity and conduct to take place at the subject property and otherwise directly and indirectly and wantonly and recklessly supported and facilitated [her son\u2019s] criminal activity at the subject property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b130-14\">Amica assigned counsel to defend Mutrie, subject to a reservation of rights. In September 2012, Amica filed a petition for declaratory judgment, requesting a ruling that Amica has no duty to defend and indemnify Mutrie because the \u201creckless and wanton misconduct\u201d alleged by the intervenors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>in their writ did not constitute an \u201coccurrence\u201d under the Policies. Subsequently, Amica moved for summary judgment. The trial court ruled in favor of Amica. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">On appeal, the intervenors argue that the trial court erred when it concluded that the reckless and wanton acts alleged by the intervenors constituted \u201cinherently injurious\u201d or \u201cintentional\u201d conduct on the part of Mutrie and, therefore, the conduct did not constitute an \u201coccurrence\u201d under the Policies. The intervenors also argue that the court erred when it failed to consider all of the materials that had been submitted in support of their opposition to Arnica\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Amica counters that the court properly ruled that Amica owes no duty to defend or indemnify Mutrie because her conduct \u2014 as alleged by the intervenors \u2014 does not constitute an \u201coccurrence.\u201d On cross-appeal, Amica also asserts that the trial court should have ruled that coverage is barred by the Policies\u2019 \u201ccontrolled substances exclusion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>the trial court\u2019s application of the law to the facts in its summary judgment ruling.\u201d <em>Progressive N. Ins. Co. v. Concord Gen. Mut. Ins. Co., </em>151 N.H. 649, 652 (2005). \u201c[W]e consider the affidavits and other evidence, and all inferences properly drawn from them, in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.\u201d <em>Lacasse v. Spaulding Youth Ctr., </em>154 N.H. 246, 248 (2006) (quotation omitted). \u201cIf our review of the evidence does not reveal a genuine issue of material fact, and if the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, we will affirm the trial court\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\"> \u201cIn New Hampshire, an insurer\u2019s obligation to defend its insured is determined by whether the cause of action against the insured alleges sufficient facts in the pleadings to bring it within the express terms of the policy.\u201d <em>Progressive N. Ins. Co. v. Argonaut Ins. Co., </em>161 N.H. 778, 780 (2011) (quotation omitted). Thus, our analysis begins with an examination of the Policies\u2019 language. <em>Id. </em>The interpretation of insurance policy language, like any contract language, is ultimately an issue of law for this court to decide. <em>Id. </em>We look to the plain and ordinary meaning of the policy\u2019s words in context. <em>Id. </em>at 781. Policy terms are construed objectively, and when the terms of a policy are clear and unambiguous, we accord the language its natural and ordinary meaning. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">We first consider whether the trial court properly found that Amica owes no duty to defend and that coverage is precluded because Mutrie\u2019s alleged conduct did not constitute an \u201coccurrence\u201d under the Policies. Pursuant to the relevant provisions in the Policies, coverage and the insurer\u2019s duty to defend are triggered only by an \u201coccurrence.\u201d The Policies define an \u201cOccurrence\u201d as \u201can accident, including continuous or repeated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions, which results, during the policy period, in: a. Bodily injury; or b. Property damage.\u201d The Policies do not define the term \u201caccident.\u201d However, in construing the word \u201coccurrence\u201d in insurance policies with similar language, we have defined \u201caccident\u201d to mean \u201can undesigned contingency, a happening by chance, something out of the usual course of things, unusual, fortuitous, not anticipated, and not naturally to be expected.\u201d <em>Vermont Mut. Ins. Co. v. Malcolm, </em>128 N.H. 521, 523 (1986) (quotation and ellipsis omitted). Unless the alleged injury is the result of an accident, there is no \u201coccurrence,\u201d and the Policies do not provide coverage. <em>See Jespersen v. U.S. Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co., </em>131 N.H. 257, 260 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">We have developed two tests to determine whether an insured\u2019s act was an accidental cause of injury \u2014 one subjective, the other objective. <em>EnergyNorth Natural Gas v. Continental Ins. Co., </em>146 N.H. 156, 162 (2001). First, \u201can insured\u2019s act is not an accidental contributing cause of injury when the insured <em>actually intended </em>to cause the injury that results.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). Second, an insured\u2019s intentional act cannot be accidental when it is so inherently injurious that \u201cit cannot be performed without a certainty that some injury will result.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). Inherently injurious conduct need only be \u201ccertain to result in <em>some </em>injury, although not necessarily the particular alleged injury.\u201d <em>Providence Mut. Fire Ins. Co. v. Scanlon, </em>138 N.H. 301, 306 (1994). The insured\u2019s intent is irrelevant to the inherently injurious test; rather, the analysis is objective and is \u201cconducted from the standpoint of a reasonable person in the position of the insured.\u201d <em>EnergyNorth Natural Gas, </em>146 N.H. at 162.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">In their writ, the intervenors allege that Mutrie, \u201cwith the knowledge, information and belief\u2019 of her son\u2019s involvement in \u201ca criminal enterprise as well as multiple different forms of criminal activity[,] . . . directly and indirectly and wantonly and recklessly supported and facilitated [his] criminal activity.\u201d They further allege that Mutrie\u2019s \u201creckless and wanton misconduct\u201d was the \u201cdirect and proximate cause\u201d of their injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">The intervenors\u2019 writ does not describe the specific \u201ccriminal enterprise\u201d in which Mutrie\u2019s son was allegedly engaged. However, looking beyond the writ itself \u2014 as the intervenors urge us to do in this case \u2014 we observe that the search warrant that the intervenors reference in their writ was issued based upon probable cause that Mutrie\u2019s son was committing the crime of \u201cConspiracy to Possess Controlled Drugs with the Intent to Distribute.\u201d <em>Cf. Happy House Amusement v. N. H. Ins. Co., </em>135 N.H. 719, 722 (1992) (in looking beyond writ in determining insurer\u2019s duty to defend, the court noted that plaintiff filed an affidavit in support of its argument); <em>U. S. Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co., Inc. v. Johnson Shoes, Inc., </em>123 N.H. 148, 152 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>(1983) (affirming trial court\u2019s decision that insurer had duty to defend where trial court looked \u201cbeyond the facts as alleged in the underlying writs\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">Because the intervenors have not alleged that Mutrie intended to cause their specific injuries, but rather that her reckless conduct contributed to their harm, we analyze her conduct under the second test, and apply the inherently injurious standard. <em>See EnergyNorth Natural Gas, </em>146 N.H. at 162; <em>see also Sheehan v. Goriansky, </em>72 N.E. 2d 538, 542 (Mass. 1947) (finding that reckless conduct differs from intentional conduct because reckless wrongdoer intends only act, not harm which results from it). Thus, the dispositive inquiry here is whether a reasonable person in Mutrie\u2019s position would know that permitting her son to engage in illegal drug activity on her property would result in some injury, although not necessarily the injury that, in fact, occurred. <em>See EnergyNorth Natural Gas, </em>146 N.H. at 162; <em>Scanlon, </em>138 N.H. at 306.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">Courts in other jurisdictions have recognized that the sale and distribution of drugs is intrinsically dangerous and harmful. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Bullock, </em>632 F.3d 1004, 1016 (7th Cir. 2011) (observing that \u201c[d]rug crimes are associated with dangerous and violent behavior\u201d); <em>United States v. Kenerson, </em>585 F.3d 389, 392 (7th Cir. 2009) (\u201c[I]t is an unfortunate fact of life that trade in controlled substances is dangerous for all involved.\u201d). As the United States District Court for the District of Nevada has observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-7\">The distribution of illegal narcotics[,] without more, causes serious harm to society. Drug dealing also creates additional real dangers \u2014 through crimes committed by addicts seeking to support their habits, through plain human suffering, and because people engaged in the sale of illegal substances sometimes commit or direct violent crimes in furtherance of their enterprises.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b133-8\"><em>United States v. Woods, </em>2:08-cr-0181-HDM-LRL, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 66986, at *9 (D. Nev. Sept. 2, 2008) (quotation, ellipsis, and brackets omitted); <em>see United States v. Askew, </em>403 F.3d 496, 508 (7th Cir. 2005) (observing that \u201c[g]uns are among the tools of the drug trade\u201d (quotation omitted)); <em>United States v. Garcia, </em>Criminal Action No. 07-CR-00529, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 72525, at *11 (E.D. Pa. Sept. 20, 2007) (observing that drug possession with the intent to distribute is \u201can inherently dangerous activity\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-9\">The intervenors allege that Mutrie knew of her son\u2019s involvement in dangerous drug activity, and that she \u201cdirectly and indirectly and wantonly and recklessly supported and facilitated\u201d it. Accordingly, we conclude that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>because a reasonable person in Mutrie\u2019s position would know that some. harm would result from her alleged knowing, reckless, and wanton support and facilitation of her son\u2019s criminal drug activity, Mutrie\u2019s conduct was inherently injurious, and, therefore, cannot be considered accidental. Therefore, her conduct does not constitute an \u201coccurrence\u201d as is necessary to trigger coverage under the Policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">The intervenors next argue that the trial court erred in failing to consider the entirety of the materials submitted by the parties on summary judgment. Specifically, the intervenors argue that the trial court erred by not considering Mutrie\u2019s denials of actual knowledge of her son\u2019s criminal activity. The intervenors, however, offer no evidence that the court failed to consider all of the materials submitted. Further, even when we consider the materials that the intervenors claim that the court ignored, we find no error. Mutrie\u2019s denials of her knowledge of her son\u2019s illegal drug activity, although highly relevant to the ultimate determination of her liability in the underlying lawsuit, are irrelevant to the narrow issue before the court: whether the intervenors\u2019 allegations bring their cause of action within the express terms of the Policies. <em>See Jespersen, </em>131 N.H. at 261 (concluding that insured\u2019s ultimate liability in underlying suit is irrelevant to determining insurer\u2019s duty to defend). We note that, in the underlying litigation against Mutrie, the intervenors do <em>not </em>allege that Mutrie engaged in accidental or negligent conduct. Thus, the intervenors fail to show that the purportedly \u201coverlooked\u201d documents \u2014 evidencing Mutrie\u2019s statements that she had no knowledge of her son\u2019s conduct \u2014 give rise to a genuine issue of material fact in this declaratory judgment action.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">Finally, the intervenors argue that Arnica\u2019s motion for summary judgment did not satisfy the requirements of RSA 491:8-a, II (2010). However, not only did the intervenors fail to identify this issue in their notice of appeal, they have not demonstrated that they raised this issue before the trial court. Accordingly, we decline to address this argument. <em>See Bean v. Red Oak Prop. Mgmt., </em>151 N.H. 248, 250 (2004); <em>LaMontagne Builders v. Bowman Brook Purchase Group, </em>150 N.H. 270; 276 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">In sum, we hold that Mutrie\u2019s alleged \u201cwanton\u201d and \u201creckless\u201d support and facilitation of her son\u2019s criminal activity is inherently injurious conduct which does not constitute an accidental \u201coccurrence.\u201d Consequently, there is no coverage under the Policies for the intervenors\u2019 claims against Mutrie. Given our conclusion, we need not reach the issue raised by Amica in its cross-appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b134-9\">Dalianis, C.J., and HICKS, CONBOY, and Lynn, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
