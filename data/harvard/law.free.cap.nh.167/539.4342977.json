The House has requested that the justices give their opinion upon the following questions of law:</p>\n<p id=\"b560-15\">\u201c1) Does HB 112 violate Part I, Article 11 of the New Hampshire State Constitution?</p>\n<p id=\"b560-16\">2) Does HB 112 violate any other provisions of the United States or the New Hampshire Constitution?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b560-17\">\n<em>To the Honorable House:</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b560-18\">The following response is respectfully returned:</p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>HB 112 proposes to amend RSA 654:1 (Supp. 2014) by inserting a new paragraph, which would provide: \u201cA person who declares an address in a New Hampshire town or ward as his or her domicile for voting purposes shall be deemed to have established his or her residence for motor vehicle law purposes at that address.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">You have asked that the undersigned justices of the supreme court render an advisory opinion as to HB 112\u2019s constitutional validity. <em>See </em>N.H. CONST, pt. II, art. 74. Part II, Article 74 requires justices of the supreme court to render advisory opinions \u201cupon important questions of law and upon solemn occasions\u201d when asked to do so by the legislature or the Governor and Council. <em>Opinion of the Justices (Appointment of Chief Justice), </em>150 N.H. 355, 356 (2003) (quotation omitted); <em>see </em>N.H. CONST, pt. II, art. 74.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">You have posed two questions about the validity of HB 112. Your first question asks whether HB 112 would violate Part I, Article 11 of the New Hampshire Constitution. Your second question asks whether HB 112 violates any other provision of the United States or the New Hampshire Constitutions. Historically, we have declined to answer general inquiries on constitutional infirmity and, in keeping with that practice, we respectfully decline to answer the second question. <em>See Opinion of the Justices (Requiring Att\u2019y Gen. to Join Lawsuit), </em>162 N.H. 160, 164 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">With regard to your first question, for the reasons that follow, \u201cafter carefully considering our constitutional duties and based upon long-established prior decisions,\u201d we respectfully ask to be excused from answering your first question at this time. <em>Opinion of the Justices (Appointment of Chief Justice), </em>150 N.H. at 357.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-8\">Part II, Article 74 of the State Constitution \u201cempowers the justices of the supreme court to render advisory opinions, outside the context of concrete, fully-developed factual situations and without the benefit of adversary legal presentations, only in carefully circumscribed situations.\u201d <em>Duncan v. State, </em>166 N.H. 630, 640 (2014) (quotation omitted). \u201cPart II, Article 74 does not authorize this court to render advisory opinions to private individuals.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cNor does it empower the court to issue advisory opinions . . . regarding existing legislation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 640-41 (quotation omitted). \u201cThat authority extends only to proposed legislation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 641. Further, when we issue such opinions, \u201cwe act not as a court, but as individual constitutional advisors to the legislative or executive branches.\u201d <em>Opinion of the Justices (Appointment of Chief Justice), </em>150 N.H. at 356. Because an opinion of the justices is an advisory opinion issued to a branch of the legislature, Governor, or Executive Council, and is not an opinion of the court in a litigated case, an opinion of the justices \u201cdoes not constitute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>binding precedent.\u201d <em>State v. Ploof, </em>162 N.H. 609, 625 (2011). Moreover, the constitutional duty of the justices of the supreme court to give advisory opinions does not include answering legal questions that require resolving questions of fact. <em>Opinion of the Justices (School </em>Financing), 142 N.H. 892, 897 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">Your first question asks whether HB 112 violates Part I, Article 11 of the New Hampshire Constitution, which provides, in pertinent part: \u201cAll elections are to be free, and every inhabitant of the state of 18 years of age and upwards shall have an equal right to vote in any election.\u201d The court has previously held that the equal right to vote, as set forth in Part I, Article 11, is fundamental. <em>Akins v. Sec\u2019y of State, </em>154 N.H. 67, 71 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">Determining whether HB 112 unconstitutionally impinges upon a complaining party\u2019s equal right to vote requires weighing \u201cthe character and magnitude of the asserted injury to the rights that [a complaining party] seeks to vindicate against the precise interests put forward by the State as justifications for the burden imposed by its rule, taking into consideration the extent to which those interests make it necessary to burden the [complaining party\u2019s] rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 72 (quotation and ellipsis omitted); <em>see Burdick v. Takushi, </em>504 U.S. 428, 434 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">Under this analytical framework, \u201cthe rigorousness of our inquiry into the propriety of [an]... election law depends upon the extent to which a challenged regulation burdens\u201d a complaining party\u2019s equal right to vote. <em>Burdick, </em>504 U.S. at 434. When an election law imposes only \u201creasonable, nondiscriminatory restrictions\u201d upon a complaining party\u2019s equal right to vote, then \u201cthe State\u2019s important regulatory interests are generally sufficient to justify\u201d those restrictions. <em>Akins, </em>154 N.H. at 72 (quotations omitted); <em>see Burdick, </em>504 U.S. at 434. By contrast, when the election law at issue subjects a complaining party\u2019s equal right to vote to \u201csevere\u201d restrictions, the law must withstand strict scrutiny to be constitutional. <em>Akins, </em>154 N.H. at 72 (quotation omitted); <em>see Burdick, </em>504 U.S. at 434. To withstand strict scrutiny, the law must \u201cbe justified by a compelling governmental interest and must be necessary to the accomplishment of its legitimate purpose.\u201d <em>Akins, </em>154 N.H. at 73 (quotation omitted). This analysis is inherently fact-specific. <em>See Cruz v. Melicio, </em>204 F.3d 14, 22 (1st Cir. 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">Currently, there is pending before the court a litigated case, with a factual record developed over two years, that raises legal issues that are similar, if not identical, to those implicated by your first question. <em>See Annemarie Guare &amp; a. v. State of New Hampshire, </em>No. 2014-0558 (N.H. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>filed Aug. 27, 2014). The notice of appeal in <em>Guare </em>was filed on August 27, 2014, the case is fully briefed, and oral argument is scheduled to take place on April 22, 2015.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">To answer your first question now would place us in the position of giving advice on issues without a developed factual record and in advance of a decision on a matter currently before the court that involves similar issues. <em>See Opinion of the Justices (Appointment of Chief Justice), </em>150 N.H. at 357. Moreover, as previously explained, an advisory opinion on your first question would not constitute a decision of the court, would not establish precedent, and, thus, would not be binding on the court when deciding <em>Guare. See Ploof </em>162 N.H. at 625.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">For these reasons, we believe that \u201corderly procedure\u201d requires that we respectfully ask to be excused from answering your first question at this time. <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>104 N.H. 342, 344 (1962). Once the <em>Guare </em>opinion is issued, the court will ask the House whether it wishes to proceed with this request. In the event that it wishes to do so, we will address the request at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">LINDA STEWART DALIANIS</p>\n<p id=\"AVH\">GARY E.

Christie </em>on the memorandum), and American Civil Liberties Union of New Hampshire, of Concord <em>(Gil\u00edes R.
