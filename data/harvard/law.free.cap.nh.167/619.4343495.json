(Marco), appeals an order of the Superior Court <em>(McHugh, </em>J.) affirming a decision of the respondent, the Commissioner of the New Hampshire Department of Safety (DOS). Following an administrative hearing, DOS determined that Marco owed the State $155,070.71, including interest and penalties, due to Marco\u2019s failure to pay the New Hampshire road toll on fuel imported into the state. On appeal, Marco argues that DOS and the trial court erred by finding that Marco was required to pay the road toll because: (1) it was not a \u201cdistributor\u201d of motor fuels under RSA 259:21 (2014); (2) it did not \u201csell\u201d motor fuel under RSA 260:32 (2014) (amended 2014); and (3) it would be unfair to require Marco to pay the New Hampshire road toll beeause.it had already paid the Massachusetts fuel tax. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-12\">Before addressing the substance of Marco\u2019s claims, we provide, for context, an overview of the relevant fees assessed by government entities on the sale of motor fuels. The New Hampshire Motor Vehicle Road Toll Law, <em>see </em>RSA 260:30 (2014), imposes a road toll \u201cupon the sale of each gallon of motor fuel sold by distributors thereof.\u201d RSA 260:32. A \u201cdistributor\u201d is defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-13\">any person, wherever resident or located, who imports or causes to be imported motor fuel into the state, and also any person who refines, distills, prepares, blends, manufactures, or compounds motor fuel within this state____Bringing motor fuel into the state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>in the fuel supply tank attached to the engine of a vehicle or aircraft shall not be considered importing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">RSA 259:21. The road toll is \u201cimposed as a recompense for the use of the highways.\u201d <em>Rymes Heating Oils v. Comm\u2019r, N.H. Dep\u2019t of Safety, </em>151 N.H. 472, 473 (2004) (quotation omitted). \u201cIn other words, the road toll fee constitutes a\u2019 charge for subjecting roads to a given amount of destructive use or wear and tear.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). New Hampshire law makes it unlawful \u201cfor any person to sell or use motor fuel upon which the road toll... has not been paid, unless the person is a holder of a valid license to engage in business as a distributor of motor fuels.\u201d RSA 260:36 (2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">Similarly, Massachusetts imposes a per gallon \u201cfuel tax\u201d that is paid by the purchaser at the time the fuel is sold. <em>See </em>Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 64A (2011 &amp; Supp. 2014). As with the New Hampshire road toll, the Massachusetts fuel tax is a fee paid by \u201cmotor carriers operating their motor vehicles in Massachusetts ... to support the State\u2019s highway system.\u201d <em>American Trucking v. Secretary of Admin., </em>613 N.E.2d 95, 98 (Mass. 1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">All of the states in the contiguous United States, including New Hampshire and Massachusetts, are parties to the International Fuel Tax Agreement (IFTA). <em>See Illinois Cent. R.R. v. Tennessee Dept. of Revenue, </em>969 F. Supp. 2d 892, 894 (M.D.Tenn. 2013). The IFTA is a \u201cmultijurisdictional agreement that is intended to encourage cooperation in the administration and collection of motor fuel use tax.\u201d <em>May Trucking Co. v. Oregon Dept. of Transp., </em>388 F.3d 1261, 1262 (9th Cir. 2004) (quotations omitted). The IFTA does not impose a tax; \u201c[r]ather, its member jurisdictions impose the motor fuel taxes, and [the] IFTA permits the uniform administration and collection of those taxes as they pertain to multi-state carriers.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1262-63. \u201cUnder [the] IFTA, an interstate motor carrier pays all its state fuel taxes quarterly to the \u2018base jurisdiction\u2019 in which it registers as a licensee under [the] IFTA.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1263. \u201cThe base jurisdiction then forwards the appropriate tax amounts to each individual state in which the motor carrier operates.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cThat arrangement prevents a motor carrier from having to make multiple tax payments to the different states in which it operates.\u201d <em>Id. \u25a0</em></p>\n<p id=\"b641-8\">The material facts are undisputed. On multiple occasions between June 2008 and March 2011, Marco contracted with Irving Oil Terminals, Inc. (Irving) for the purchase of diesel fuel. These purchases totaled 603,138 gallons. Each purchase included the transfer of fuel by Irving, at its facility located in Revere, Massachusetts, into trucks operated by P.S. Marston, LLC (Marston). Marston and Marco share a business address in North Hampton, New Hampshire. Marston transported the fuel from Revere to Marco\u2019s facility in North Hampton, New Hampshire. Marston invoiced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>Marco for the deliveries, and Marco paid those bills. The bill of lading issued by Irving for each sale was identical except for the date of sale, amount of fuel purchased, and the invoice amount. Also in connection with each purchase, Marco paid the Massachusetts fuel tax to Irving, and Irving then forwarded the funds to Massachusetts.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">In 2012, DOS audited Marco\u2019s \u201cMotor Fuel Distributor\u201d account. DOS concluded that Marco \u201cimported motor fuel into [New Hampshire] without a Motor Fuel Distributor license and therefore failed to report and pay the required [New Hampshire] road toll\u201d on the 603,138 gallons of fuel purchased from Irving. DOS calculated that Marco owed the State $155,070.71. Marco challenged the audit by DOS and requested an administrative hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">DOS held a hearing in September 2012. Marco argued that it was not liable for the New Hampshire road toll because it was not a \u201cdistributor\u201d of motor fuels but, rather, the end purchaser. The DOS road toll audit manager asserted that Marco acted as a \u201cdistributor\u201d without a current Motor Fuel Distributor license or IFTA license and unlawfully imported motor fuel into New Hampshire. DOS rejected Marco\u2019s argument, finding that Marco acted as a distributor of motor fuel and that the assessment was proper. Marco appealed to the superior court.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. Marco argued that, because Irving hired Marston to deliver the fuel to Marco in New Hampshire, Irving, rather than Marco, acted as the distributor for purposes of the New Hampshire road toll. In response, DOS argued that Irving merely transferred the fuel to Marston in Massachusetts, and that Marco was the distributor because, under RSA 259:21, Marco \u201cimported] or cause[d] to be imported,\u201d the fuel into New Hampshire. The court agreed with the ruling by DOS, concluding that \u201cMarco did purchase fuel on which a road toll had not been paid, and it transported the fuel across the State\u2019s highways.\u201d This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">On appeal, Marco argues that Irving, not Marco, acted as a \u201cdistributor\u201d of motor fuels under RSA 259:21 and 260:32, and that DOS should recover the New Hampshire road toll from Irving. DOS counters that Marco caused the fuel to be imported into New Hampshire and, as such, acted as a \u201cdistributor\u201d and is responsible for paying the New Hampshire road toll. Marco next argues that, because it used the fuel only in its own vehicles, there was no \u201csale\u201d of motor fuel by Marco, which is required to trigger payment of the road toll under RSA 260:32. DOS responds that Marco failed to preserve this argument because Marco raises the issue for the first time on appeal. Alternatively, DOS maintains that the statutory definition of \u201csale\u201d includes \u201cany use of motor fuel by a distributor.\u201d RSA 259:95 (2014). Finally, Marco contends that it is unfair to require it to pay the New <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>Hampshire road toll when there is no dispute that it has already paid the Massachusetts fuel tax on the same gallons of fuel, and that-DOS should seek to recover the road toll from Massachusetts. DOS counters that it is undisputed that the New Hampshire road toll has not been paid, and, if Marco had the proper distributor licenses, the fuel tax paid by Marco \u2014 which Irving then paid to Massachusetts \u2014 could have been reallocated to New Hampshire in accordance with the IFTA.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-4\">In reviewing the trial court\u2019s ruling on cross-motions for summary judgment, we consider the evidence in the light most favorable to each party in its capacity as the nonmoving party and, if no genuine issue of material fact exists, we determine whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Bovaird v. N.H. Dep\u2019t of Admin. Servs., </em>166 N.H. 755, 758 (2014). If our review of that evidence discloses no genuine issue of material fact and if the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, then we will affirm the grant of summary judgment. <em>Id. </em>In this case, the superior court found that \u201c[t]he parties do not dispute the material facts; they dispute the legal import of those facts.\u201d We review the trial court\u2019s application of the law to the facts <em>de novo. Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">This appeal requires interpretation of certain provisions of the Motor Vehicle Road Toll Law. \u201cIn matters of statutory interpretation, this court is the final arbiter of the intent of the legislature as expressed in the words of a statute considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Rymes Heating Oils, </em>151 N.H. at 474 (quotation omitted). \u2018We begin by reviewing the plain and ordinary meaning of the words used and consider them not in isolation but in context of the overall statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cIn doing so, we are better able to discern the legislature\u2019s intent, and therefore better able to understand the statutory language in light of the policy sought to be advanced by the entire statutory scheme.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">Marco first argues that DOS erred because, contrary to the finding by DOS, it was Irving \u2014 rather than Marco \u2014 that acted as a \u201cdistributor\u201d as defined in RSA 259:21. In relevant part, the statute states: \u201c \u2018Distributor,\u2019 ... shall mean any person, wherever resident or located, who imports or causes to be imported motor fuel into the state ...\u201d RSA 259:21. Accordingly, if Marco \u201cimport[ed] or cause[d] to be imported\u201d fuel into New Hampshire, then Marco acted as a \u201cdistributor\u201d and was required to pay the New Hampshire road toll.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">Marco contends that its designation as the \u201cconsignee\u201d in the bill of lading created a destination contract requiring delivery to Marco in New Hampshire. <em>See </em>RSA 382-A:7-102(a)(3) (Supp. 2014) (defining \u201cconsignee\u201d as the \u201cperson named in a bill of lading to which or to whose order the bill promises delivery\u201d). Marco asserts that, because the bill of lading was a destination contract, Irving held title to the fuel when it entered New <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>Hampshire, and, therefore, Irving was the distributor. DOS counters that Marco received title to the fuel in Massachusetts. However, DOS also argues that, regardless of when and where title passed from Irving to Marco, it was Marco that \u201ccaused the import\u201d of the fuel into New Hampshire. We agree with DOS on this latter point.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\">The statutory definition of \u201cdistributor\u201d does not require a determination of which entity had title at the time when the fuel was transported across the state line into New Hampshire. <em>See </em>RSA 259:21. We agree with DOS that, when title to the fuel passed to Marco has little, if any, relevance to the specific issues before us, which is whether Marco or Irving \u201cimport[ed] or causefd] to be imported\u201d the fuel into New Hampshire. <em>Id. </em>Additionally, we note that Marston \u2014 the entity that physically transported the fuel into New Hampshire \u2014 is not a party to this action, and neither party argues that Marston acted as the distributor in this instance. Instead, Marco argues that Marston was acting on behalf of Irving, and DOS argues that Marco hired Marston to deliver the fuel.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">The sequence of events relating to each sale, together with the undisputed evidence in the record, supports the conclusion that Marco \u201cimport[ed] or cause[d] to be imported\u201d the fuel into New Hampshire. It is undisputed that Marco was the end user of the fuel, and that Marston transported the fuel to Marco. After Marston delivered the fuel to Marco, Marston billed Marco for the delivery. Marco does not dispute the fact that Marco, in fact, paid those invoices, rather than Irving. The record does not contain any documentation demonstrating that Irving and Marston had an agreement to deliver the fuel to Marco in New Hampshire.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">Marco\u2019s argument is, in essence, that its designation as \u201cconsignee\u201d on a bill of lading created a destination contract, which, standing alone, means that Irving had title to the fuel when it entered New Hampshire, and, therefore, that Irving \u201cimport[ed] or cause[d] to be imported\u201d the fuel into New Hampshire. We are not persuaded. To the contrary, we agree with the determination made by both DOS and the trial court \u2014 that Marco imported or caused to be imported motor fuel into New Hampshire, and that, Marco acted as a \u201cdistributor\u201d as defined by RSA 259:21.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">Marco next argues that, regardless of whether it acted as a distributor, it was not required to pay the New Hampshire road toll because it did not \u201csell\u201d the motor vehicle fuel but was \u201cmerely the end user.\u201d <em>See </em>RSA 260:32. DOS counters that Marco failed to preserve this issue for appeal. Alternatively, DOS argues that, even if we assume that this argument is preserved, the term \u201csale\u201d as used in the Motor Vehicle Road Toll Law does not require a transaction involving a third party.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number> Assuming, without deciding, that this argument is preserved, we agree with DOS. The road toll is imposed \u201cupon the <em>sale </em>of each gallon of motor fuel sold by distributors thereof. The road toll shall be collected by the distributor from the purchaser and remitted to the state . . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). The term \u201csale\u201d is defined in the Motor Vehicle Road Toll Law to mean \u201cany transfer of ownership <em>and any use of motor fuel </em>by a distributor for the propulsion of vehicles on the ways.\u201d RSA 259:95 (2014) (emphasis added). This expansive definition is entirely consistent with the stated purpose of the Motor Vehicle Road Toll Law: \u201cto secure the motor fuel road toll. .. with respect to the sale <em>or consumption </em>of motor fuels.\u201d RSA 260:31 (2014) (emphasis added). Moreover, because the road toll is \u201ca charge for subjecting roads to a given amount of destructive use or wear and tear,\u201d <em>Rymes Heating Oils, </em>151 N.H. at 473 (quotation omitted), including the \u201cuse of motor fuel\u201d in the definition of \u201csale\u201d is logical. Here, because Marco has acknowledged that it purchased \u201cthe fuel for its own internal use,\u201d and it has never argued the fuel was used elsewhere than on the roads of New Hampshire, we conclude that Marco\u2019s use of the fuel falls squarely within the definition of \u201csale\u201d in RSA 259:95.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-4\">We also reject Marco\u2019s argument that it is \u201cgrossly inequitable and unfair\u201d to require it to pay the New Hampshire road toll when it has already paid the Massachusetts fuel tax. This arguably unfair situation arose only because Marco did not avail itself of the interstate mechanism in place \u2014 the IFTA \u2014 to prevent just this type of double payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">An IFTA licensee \u201cpays all its state fuel taxes quarterly to the \u2018base jurisdiction\u2019 in which it registers as a licensee under the IFTA.\u201d <em>May Trucking Co., </em>388 F.3d at 1263. \u201cThe base jurisdiction then forwards the appropriate tax amounts to each individual state in which the motor carrier operates.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Additionally, in New Hampshire, it is unlawful \u201cfor any person to sell or use motor fuel upon which the road toll.. . has not been paid, unless the person is a holder of a valid license to engage in business as a distributor of motor fuels.\u201d RSA 260:36. Although, by its terms, RSA 260:32 does not make it unlawful for Marco to operate without a license \u2014 provided that it pays the road toll \u2014 it is undisputed that the New Hampshire road toll has not been paid on the fuel Marco imported into New Hampshire.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">There is also no dispute that, at the time of the purchases, Marco did \u201cnot hold a current Motor Fuel Distributor license or a current international fuel tax . . . license.\u201d In fact, at the administrative hearing, Marco conceded that it had \u201can IFTA issue.\u201d If, at the time of the purchases, Marco had a New Hampshire Motor Fuel Distributor license and an IFTA license, it would have been required to document where the fuel was used. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number><em>See </em>International Fuel Tax Agreement Procedures Manual P550.100 (rev. ed. 2015) (\u201cThe licensee must maintain complete records of all motor fuel purchased, received, and used in the conduct of its business.\u201d); <em>see also </em>RSA 260:38 (2014) (amended 2014). Under those circumstances, Marco would have paid the fuel tax to its base jurisdiction, which, in turn, would have allocated a proportional share to each state based on fuel consumption. <em>See May Trucking Co., </em>388 F.3d at 1263. Given the IFTA framework, we are not persuaded by Marco\u2019s contention that \u201cIrving erroneously paid Massachusetts\u2019 road toll tax on the fuel. . . rather than paying the State of New Hampshire\u2019s road toll tax.\u201d It defies common sense to charge Irving with the knowledge of where Marco \u2014 an unlicensed out-of-state distributor \u2014 consumed the fuel that it purchased from Irving. As a distributor, Marco had the obligation, pursuant to RSA 260:32, to collect and remit the road toll to New Hampshire.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Marco, therefore, must bear the ultimate responsibility for non-payment of the New Hampshire road toll.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">Finally, we are not persuaded by Marco\u2019s argument that DOS \u2014 rather than Marco \u2014 has the responsibility to recover the Massachusetts fuel tax that Marco paid to Irving. The Massachusetts statute provides otherwise: it states that it is Marco\u2019s responsibility to seek from Massachusetts any reimbursement to which it may be entitled. <em>See </em>Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 64A, \u00a7 7 (2011) (providing that the individual seeking a reimbursement must file an affidavit and supporting documentation with the commissioner of revenue). Indeed, Marco acknowledged at oral argument that, had it filed a timely claim in Massachusetts, it could have sought a refund of the fuel tax that it paid in Massachusetts. <em>See id. </em>The fact that Marco, due to its own actions or inaction, may now be time-barred from obtaining a refund from Massachusetts does not render the assessment of the New Hampshire road toll against Marco \u201cgrossly inequitable and unfair.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b646-6\">Dalianis, C.J., and Hicks, Conboy, and Lynn, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b646-7\"> Athough RSA 260:32 states that the road toll shall be collected by the distributor \u201cfrom the purchaser,\u201d because a user of fuel such as Marco qualifies as a distributor under RSA 259:21, we construe RSA 260:32 to mean that the road toll is to be collected from the purchaser only if, in fact, there has been such a sale.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
