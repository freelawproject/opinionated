Conrad, appeals an order of the Superior Court <em>(Smukler, </em>J.) granting the defendants\u2019 motion for a directed verdict on grounds that they were entitled to sovereign, official, and qualified immunity. The plaintiff brought suit against both defendants, New Hampshire Department of Safety (NHDS) and New Hampshire State Police Lieutenant Mark Myrdek, for false imprisonment, and against Myrdek for a violation of his civil rights pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (2012), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>seeking damages for events that occurred on November 28, 2007. The defendants cross-appeal, raising evidentiary issues. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">\n<em>I. Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">The following facts are supported by the record. On November 28, 2007, the plaintiff was a state trooper working as a detective in the Major Crimes Unit. He had been employed as a state trooper since 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">In September 2007, the plaintiff was experiencing marital problems. On September 22, after the plaintiff reported his wife missing, he failed to stop for police officers when speeding through the town of Meredith in his personal vehicle. Thereafter, he requested state police assistance, including the canine unit, to search for his wife after her car was located behind a school. The plaintiffs unit commander, Captain Russell Conte, received a telephone call at approximately three o\u2019clock in the morning from the plaintiffs troop commander, informing him of these events.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-8\">The report of this incident was provided to the director of the state police, Colonel Frederick Booth, and to Myrdek, commander of the state police professional standards unit. The report included the following facts: that the plaintiff had his wife\u2019s car towed from the school parking lot; he returned to the parking lot to wait for her; and that, when she returned to the parking lot accompanied by another man, the plaintiff told him that he was \u201cf-ing lucky to be breathing.\u201d On Monday September 24, Booth met with the plaintiff and cautioned him to \u201cbe scrupulously careful about not bringing his personal life into his work life.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b83-9\">In October, the plaintiffs wife filed for divorce. That same month, she called the state police, claiming that the plaintiff had locked himself in the bathroom with his service weapon. The plaintiff denied that the incident had occurred; nonetheless, he was placed on administrative leave. He was relieved of his service weapon and police cruiser, and referred to the Employee Assistance Program. The plaintiff returned to full duty in early November 2007, after a counselor determined that he was \u201ccurrently not a danger to himself or others.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b83-10\">On November 8, following a family court hearing attended by the plaintiff and his estranged wife, the court issued a temporary divorce decree. Pursuant to that decree, \u201cEach party [was] restrained and enjoined from entering the home or the place of employment of the other party, and from harassing, intimidating or threatening the other party or his/her relatives or other household members.\u201d The plaintiff testified that he was not aware of the restraining order prior to the incident on November 28, because his mail was still being sent to the marital home in Laconia and he was staying in Concord.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>On November 26, Conte received a telephone call from the Laconia Police Department, informing him that the plaintiffs wife had requested additional patrols by her home after she and the plaintiff had argued over the telephone the previous night. During that phone call, the plaintiff told his wife that he was \u201cgoing to hell for what [he wanted] to do.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">Later on November 26, the plaintiff visited Conte\u2019s office and told him he was thinking of resigning and \u201cgoing . . . away.\u201d Conte described the plaintiff as being \u201cdisheveled,\u201d \u201cemotional,\u201d and \u201cangry about his wife.\u201d Given that the plaintiff was only eight months from full retirement, Conte encouraged him to seek the advice of an attorney before making a final decision. When asked by Conte about his \u201cgoing to hell\u201d statement, the plaintiff explained that it referred to him leaving his children, moving out of state, and withdrawing his retirement funds to split with his wife. Although Conte testified that he took the plaintiffs explanation at \u201cface value,\u201d he also had \u201creservations.\u201d Accordingly, as soon as the plaintiff left his office, Conte went to speak with his superior to advise him of the conversation so that his superior could pass it on to Booth.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">The next day, Conte received a telephone call from the plaintiffs wife, asking where the plaintiff was. She told Conte, among other things, that she thought the plaintiff had been in her residence the night before, and that he had erased messages on the answering machine and \u201cmoved some stuff around.\u201d Following this conversation, Conte spoke by telephone with the wife\u2019s attorney who confirmed that the temporary divorce decree included a provision prohibiting the plaintiff from entering his wife\u2019s residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">Conte was \u201cvery concerned\u201d and immediately discussed the matter with Major Susan Forey, the head of the Field Operations Bureau, and Myrdek. Based upon information communicated to Conte by the plaintiff\u2019s wife \u2014 including that the plaintiff may have been in her residence in violation of the temporary divorce decree, that she was concerned about the plaintiff\u2019s welfare, and that the plaintiff had allegedly commented to her that he knew where her attorney lived \u2014 Conte, Forey, and Myrdek decided to open an internal affairs investigation and to have Myrdek speak with the plaintiff the following day.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-8\">On November 28, the plaintiff was attending an off-site training session when he was contacted by NHDS staff and told to report to Myrdek\u2019s office at state police headquarters. The plaintiff arrived at Myrdek\u2019s office at approximately 2:05 p.m. Myrdek informed him that he was subject to an administrative interview and provided him with a \u201cGarrity Warning\u201d containing the allegations that were the subject of the investigation. <em>See Garrity v. New Jersey, </em>385 U.S. 493 (1967); <em>Appeal of Waterman, </em>154 N.H. 437, 442 (2006) (before any interview of a state trooper may take place a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>\u201cGarrity Warning\u201d must be given, \u201cinform[ing] the accused that the purpose of questioning is to assist in determining whether to impose administrative discipline\u201d). These allegations included \u201c[t]he possible violation of a temporary court order regarding [the plaintiffs] pending divorce and comments [he] may have made to [his] wife regarding [his] actions and her attorney.\u201d The plaintiff responded that the allegations were \u201cbullshit\u201d and that his wife \u201ccan\u2019t prove I was in the house, because I wasn\u2019t.\u201d The plaintiff was agitated. The plaintiff stated that he wanted union representation and Myrdek allowed him to leave to make such arrangements.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">The plaintiff contacted a union representative, Trooper Christopher LaPorte, who in turn asked to speak to Myrdek. The plaintiff returned to Myrdek\u2019s office at approximately 2:30 p.m. and Myrdek spoke on the telephone with LaPorte. Myrdek explained that there had been an allegation that the plaintiff had violated a restraining order and made threats against his estranged wife, and that immediate action had to be taken. LaPorte indicated that he thought the issues were beyond his ability as a representative and suggested that the plaintiff seek the assistance of the union attorney, James Donchess. Myrdek agreed that it would be a good idea to have Donchess present for the interview if he could get there within a reasonable amount of time. The plaintiff left Myrdek\u2019s office again to continue to make arrangements for union representation. The plaintiff was still agitated.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">Sometime between 2:45 and 3:00 p.m., as the plaintiff was returning to Myrdek\u2019s office to report on his efforts to contact Donchess, he met Myrdek in the hall. The plaintiff informed Myrdek that Donchess was not available and that the interview would need to be rescheduled to Thursday or Friday. Myrdek directed the plaintiff back to Myrdek\u2019s office and asked him to close the door. The plaintiff and Myrdek argued about whether the interview was going to occur that day, their voices rising. The plaintiff told Myrdek that he was not going to speak to him without Donchess present. Myrdek responded that the interview was going to be conducted that day, so the plaintiff would need to find other union representation. When Myrdek told the plaintiff he was not going to let him leave headquarters until the plaintiff spoke with him about .the allegations, the plaintiff became enraged.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">The plaintiff then told Myrdek he was quitting and he tried to hand him a resignation letter. Myrdek refused to accept it and told the plaintiff the colonel would not accept it either. The plaintiff responded, \u2018Well, F you and F the colonel. I\u2019m leaving, I quit.\u201d The plaintiff then opened up his jacket and said, \u201c[H]ere\u2019s my gun and here\u2019s my badge, I quit.\u201d Myrdek put his arms up and said, \u201cJimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy, calm down. I don\u2019t want your gun and I don\u2019t want your badge.\u201d The plaintiff told Myrdek that he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>leaving. Myrdek responded by telling him that he couldn\u2019t leave, and that he needed to calm down. Myrdek testified that the plaintiff appeared to be out of control and not making rational decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">When the plaintiff attempted to leave the office, Myrdek stepped between the plaintiff and the closed door, put his hand on the doorframe, and ordered the plaintiff to stay. The plaintiff reached under Myrdek\u2019s arm and opened the door. Because the door opened in, Myrdek stepped out of the way so the plaintiff could open the door, but then stepped back into the doorway. Myrdek continued to urge the plaintiff to calm down and ordered him to sit down. The plaintiff said, \u201cI f***ing quit. . . I\u2019m all done. F*** you,\u201d and walked past Myrdek into a common area.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">Myrdek followed the plaintiff into the common area and again stood in front of him, ordering him to go back in his office and sit down. Lieutenant Liebl, whose office was behind Myrdek\u2019s, was watching from his office doorway because he had heard loud arguing in Myrdek\u2019s office. The plaintiff asked why Myrdek was taking the wife\u2019s side, referred to her as a \u201cc**t,\u201d said he was \u201call f***ing done\u201d and walked past Myrdek. Liebl testified that because of the plaintiff\u2019s \u201cdemeanor, the words, the profanity, the crudeness,\u201d that \u201cclearly [the plaintiff] was very, very agitated, very angry.\u201d As the plaintiff continued down the hallway toward an exit door, he punched the door with considerable force. Myrdek then grabbed the plaintiff in \u201ca bear hug,\u201d and he and Liebl struggled with the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">Forey, hearing \u201calarming raised voices,\u201d left her office to see what was happening and saw the plaintiff, Myrdek, and Liebl in a \u201cscuffle.\u201d As the three officers continued to struggle, Forey put her hand on her taser. Because the plaintiff was so angry, Forey thought that the officers were not going to be able to overpower him and that she would have to \u201ctase\u201d him. The plaintiff slowly relaxed and Myrdek slowly released his hold on him and asked him to come back into the office and wait for the union representatives. When the plaintiff and Myrdek went back into Myrdek\u2019s office, Forey positioned officers outside the door for \u201ceveryone\u2019s safety,\u201d including the civilian personnel working in the building.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-8\">Inside the office, the officers removed the plaintiff\u2019s weapon and handed it out the door. The plaintiff remained there for approximately the next two hours. During that time, the plaintiff was very emotional, crying, and saying his career was over. He expressed hostility toward his wife, and he said that life was not worth living. The plaintiff said he was going to take Myrdek\u2019s gun, thereby forcing another officer to shoot him. At one point he threatened to jump out a window, and talked about committing suicide. He stated he wished he had been killed in Iraq. He called his wife on the telephone and yelled vulgarities.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>When Booth returned to police headquarters at approximately 4:30 p.m., Forey met with him and an attorney from the department of safety and told them what had happened. Booth then met with Department of Safety Commissioner John Barthelmes, and, \u201c[i]n order to give [the plaintiff] a fair judgment,\u201d the decision was made to have the Concord Police Department take custody of the plaintiff and handle any criminal charges that might result from the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">The Concord police arrived at headquarters at approximately 5:30 p.m. Forey met with them when they entered the. building to apprise them of the gravity of the situation and warn them, for their own safety, not to let their guard down at the hospital. When the plaintiff was told he was under arrest, he \u201cexploded,\u201d was \u201cscreaming and crying,\u201d and threatened one of the Concord police officers, saying that he was going to take the officer\u2019s gun and shoot the officer and then turn the gun on himself. Concord police took the plaintiff into custody and transported him by ambulance to Concord Hospital. The plaintiff was subsequently admitted to the New Hampshire Hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">The plaintiff brought suit against NHDS and Myrdek for false imprisonment and against Myrdek for a violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (section 1983). Although the trial .court reserved the section 1983 claim for its own determination, it held a nine-day jury trial in May 2012 on the plaintiff\u2019s false imprisonment claim. The defendants moved for a directed verdict at the close of the plaintiff\u2019s ease. The defendants argued that the false imprisonment claim against NHDS and Myrdek was barred by sovereign and official immunity, and the section 1983 claim against Myrdek was barred by qualified immunity. The trial court took the motion under advisement. Following closing arguments and jury instructions, the trial court stated that, should the jury return a verdict for the plaintiff, it would rule on the immunity issues. The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff, awarding $1.5 million in compensatory damages on the false imprisonment claim, attributing seventy percent of the fault to NHDS and thirty percent to Myrdek.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">The trial court thereafter ruled on the defendants\u2019 motion for a directed verdict. In its order the court noted that \u201c[t]he defendants\u2019 motion does not attack the plaintiff\u2019s ability to satisfy the elements of a false imprisonment claim; indeed, at this point they cannot do so because the jury has found that the plaintiff met his burden of proving the elements of false imprisonment.\u201d The trial court nonetheless concluded that NHDS was entitled to sovereign immunity, and that Myrdek was entitled to official immunity, on the false imprisonment claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-8\">Viewing the record in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, the court found that the NHDS officers, acting within the scope of their employment, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>\u201chad a reasonable basis to believe that their conduct was lawful\u201d because \u201c[t]he officers knew that the plaintiff was having an extremely difficult time with the divorce,\u201d \u201c[t]he plaintiff used highly inappropriate language throughout the interview process, most of which was directed toward his wife,\u201d and \u201cthe plaintiff became extremely upset and punched a door hard before he left the common area.\u201d The court also found that the NHDS officers \u201ccould have reasonably believed that the plaintiff violated a protective order\u201d because Conte and Myrdek \u201creceived information from the Laconia police department and from Ms. Conrad that the plaintiff . . . [had] enterfed] Ms. Conrad\u2019s home\u201d and, further, that the officers \u201chad information that the plaintiff told his wife he would \u2018go to hell\u2019 for what he \u2018was about to do.\u2019 \u201d As to the two-hour detention of the plaintiff at state police headquarters, the trial court found that the officers believed that they were justified in detaining the plaintiff based upon his behavior and statements, including his threats to commit \u201csuicide by cop.\u201d The court also found that the officers acted reasonably in contacting their superiors and that because there was \u201cno evidence that any participant failed to treat the matter with the appropriate priority,\u201d under the circumstances \u201cthe two-hour period to allow the officers to deliberate and come to a referral decision was not unreasonable.\u201d Accordingly, the trial court concluded that NHDS was entitled to sovereign immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">In addition, the court found that Myrdek was entitled to official immunity under RSA 99-D:l (2013), which provides that state officials and employees are protected from \u201ccivil actions arising from acts committed within the scope of their official duty while in the course of their employment for the state and not in a wanton or reckless manner.\u201d RSA 99-D:l. The court reasoned that because it had already determined that Myrdek, \u201cin conjunction with his fellow officers, acted . . . within the scope of his employment,\u201d and \u201chad a reasonable basis to believe that his conduct was lawful,\u201d his conduct could not be deemed wanton or reckless.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">Finally, the trial court found that Myrdek was entitled to qualified immunity on the plaintiff\u2019s section 1983 claim. The court noted that \u201c[t]he plaintiff\u2019s writ alleges that [Lieutenant] Myrdek violated his Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures in that [Lieutenant] Myrdek intentionally or recklessly restrained the plaintiff, without probable cause, for several hours.\u201d The court reasoned that, under the circumstances, the plaintiffs right to be free from confinement was not \u201csufficiently clear,\u201d and that Myrdek \u201chad a rational basis for his concern about Ms. Conrad\u2019s safety.\u201d After observing that courts \u201cconsistently recognize the difficulties law enforcement officers face in determining whether particular searches or seizures comport with the Fourth Amendment,\u201d the trial court concluded that, given \u201cMyrdek\u2019s concomitant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>and commingled roles of employer and law enforcement officer,\u201d Myrdek was entitled to qualified immunity. (Quotation omitted.) The trial court denied the plaintiff\u2019s motion for reconsideration, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">\n<em>II. Issues on Appeal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">The plaintiff argues that the trial court failed to apply the correct standard when it ruled on the defendants\u2019 motion for a directed verdict, and erred in granting the motion. The defendants cross-appeal; however, because we affirm the trial court\u2019s rulings on immunity, we need not address the cross-appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">This case involves three types of immunity: sovereign, official, and qualified. \u201cVarious concepts of immunity exist under both common law and statutory law to protect governmental entities and public officials from liability for injury allegedly caused by official conduct.\u201d <em>Everitt v. Gen. Elec. Co., </em>156 N.H. 202, 209 (2007). Immunity is based upon the recognition that \u201ccertain essential, fundamental activities of government must remain immune from tort liability so that our government can govern.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 210 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-8\">\u201cSovereign immunity protects the State itself from suit in its own courts without its consent, and shields it from liability for torts committed by its officers and employees.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 209 (quotations omitted). \u201cWith respect to personal liability for public officials and employees, the doctrines of qualified immunity and official immunity provide immunity for wrongful acts committed within the scope of their government employment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Qualified immunity \u201cshields against lawsuits alleging constitutional violations, such as claims brought under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Official immunity \u201cshields against lawsuits alleging common law torts, such as negligence.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b89-9\">\u201cThe goal of official immunity is to protect public officials from the fear of personal liability, which might deter independent action and impair effective performance of their duties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 215 (quotation omitted). \u201cA genuine need exists to preserve independence of action without deterrence or intimidation by the fear of personal liability and vexatious suits.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation and brackets omitted).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-10\">It would be manifestly unfair to place any public official in a position in which he is required to exercise his judgment and at the same time is held responsible according to the judgment of others, who may have no experience in the area and may be much less qualified than he to pass judgment in a discerning fashion or who may now be acting largely on the basis of hindsight.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b90-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number><em>Id. </em>(quotation and brackets omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">Because immunity provides public officials immunity from suit, rather than a mere defense to liability, if at all possible, immunity claims are to be resolved before trial, thereby freeing officials \u201cfrom the concerns of litigation, including avoidance of disruptive discovery.\u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 685 (2009) (quotation omitted); <em>see Hunter v. Bryant, </em>502 U.S. 224, 228 (1991) (\u201cImmunity ordinarily should be decided by the court long before trial.\u201d); <em>Maldonado v. Fontanes, </em>568 F.3d 263, 268 (1st Cir. 2009). Further, the collateral consequences of potential liability and of mounting a defense, which \u201cinclude the general costs of subjecting officials to the risks of trial \u2014 distraction of officials from their governmental duties, inhibition of discretionary action, and deterrence of able people from public service,\u201d are also avoided. <em>Mitchell v. Forsyth, </em>472 U.S. 511, 526 (1985) (quotation omitted). Given that \u201cthe purpose of immunity is to operate as a bar to a lawsuit,\u201d it is \u201ceffectively lost if a case is erroneously permitted to go to trial.\u201d <em>Everitt, </em>156 N.H. at 221 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">\n<em>III. Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\"> \u201cA trial court may grant a motion for a directed verdict only if it determines, after considering the evidence and construing all inferences therefrom most favorably to the non-moving party, that no rational juror could conclude that the non-moving party is entitled to any relief.\u201d <em>Dillman v. N.H. College, </em>150 N.H. 431, 434 (2003). The court \u201cmay not weigh the evidence or judge the credibility of witnesses and should deny the motion for a directed verdict unless it can affirmatively determine that the plaintiff is not entitled to any relief on the evidence presented.\u201d <em>Clark &amp; Lavey Benefits Solutions v. Educ. Dev. Ctr., </em>157 N.H. 220, 226 (2008). We will uphold a trial court\u2019s ruling on a motion for a directed verdict \u201cwhen the record supports the conclusion that the trial court did not commit an unsustainable exercise of discretion.\u201d <em>Dillman, </em>150 N.H. at 434; <em>see Hall v. Dartmouth Hitchcock Med. Ctr., </em>153 N.H. 388, 393 (2006) (explaining that although made at different points in a trial, \u201cmotions for directed verdict and judgment notwithstanding the verdict are essentially the same, and they are governed by identical standards\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-8\">Sovereign immunity is a jurisdictional question, <em>LaRoche, Adm\u2019r v. Doe, </em>134 N.H. 562, 566 (1991), subject to <em>de novo </em>review, <em>see, e.g., In the Matter of Mallett &amp; Mallett, </em>163 N.H. 202, 207 (2012). Likewise, qualified immunity is a legal question, which we review <em>de novo. Snelling v. City of Claremont, </em>155 N.H. 674, 684 (2007); <em>see Guillemard-Ginorio v. Contreras-G\u00f3mez, </em>585 F.3d 508, 525 (1st Cir. 2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>In reviewing the qualified immunity ruling, \u201cwe construe the facts in the light most favorable to [the plaintiff], and decide legal questions <em>de </em>novo.\u201d <em>Wilson v. City of Boston, </em>421 F.3d 45, 53-54 (1st Cir. 2005). \u201c[I]t makes little difference that we review the qualified immunity question after trial instead of before it____[T]he procedural posture ... does not greatly influence the standard of review.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation and brackets omitted); <em>see Porter v. City of Manchester, </em>151 N.H. 30, 48 (2004) (\u201cWhen a qualified immunity defense is pressed after a jury verdict, the evidence must be construed in the light most hospitable to the party that prevailed at trial.\u201d (quotation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\"><em>IV. Legal Standard </em>\u2014 <em>Qualified Immunity</em></p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">The plaintiff argues that the trial court \u201cviolated the correct standard of review required when conducting a qualified immunity inquiry <em>after </em>a jury verdict.\u201d He asserts that in a Fourth Amendment case \u201c[w]hen a defense of qualified immunity is pressed after a jury verdict,... the evidence must be construed in the light most hospitable to the party that prevailed at trial,\u201d and \u201cdeference should be accorded to the jury\u2019s discernible resolution of disputed factual issues,\u201d quoting <em>Jennings v. Jones, </em>499 F.3d 2, 7 (1st Cir. 2007) (emphasis and quotations omitted). According to the plaintiff, \u201c[t]he post-verdict standard of review requires the trial court to give deference to the jury\u2019s determination of facts that should be controlling in the immunity analysis\u201d and, therefore, \u201cthe trial court is required to apply those findings of fact in conducting the immunity analysis.\u201d (Emphases omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b91-8\">In response, the defendants argue that the plaintiff\u2019s \u201cassertion that the jury was instructed on the immunity issue and found that the defendants could not have reasonably believed it was lawful to detain [him] is incorrect.\u201d The defendants assert that \u201c[w]hile the facts are considered in the light most favorable to the [p]laintiff, the immunity question was for only the trial court to decide.\u201d (Emphasis omitted.) Thus, they contend, \u201cthe question on appeal is not whether the jury could have found that the Defendants did not reasonably believe their conduct to be lawful, but rather whether the trial court could have found that the Defendants reasonably believed that their conduct was lawful.\u201d (Emphases omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b91-9\">As the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit has observed regarding claims of qualified immunity under federal law, \u201cthe Supreme Court has not clearly indicated whether the judge may act as fact-finder when there is a factual dispute underlying the qualified immunity defense or whether this function must be fulfilled by a jury.\u201d <em>Kelley v. LaForce, </em>288 F.3d 1, 7 n.2 (1st Cir. 2002). The trial court concluded that it \u201cneed not resolve this issue ... because the plaintiff cannot prevail on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>immunity issue on the evidence presented\u201d during the jury trial. Accordingly, after explicitly noting that the plaintiff had met his burden at trial of proving the elements of false imprisonment, the trial court proceeded to \u201cbas[e] its [immunity] analysis on the trial record viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.\u201d We find no error in the standard applied by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">\n<em>V. Qualified Immunity as to Myrdek</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">We first consider the plaintiff\u2019s argument that the trial court erred in granting a directed verdict on his section 1983 claim. Section 1983 provides a civil remedy against any person who, under color of state law, deprives another of rights protected by the United States Constitution. <em>Collins v. Harker Heights, </em>503 U.S. 115, 120 (1992). Section 1983 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-7\">Every person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State or Territory or the District of Columbia, subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b92-8\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-9\">According to the plaintiff, the claim against Myrdek is \u201cbased on his unlawful and unreasonable seizure of the plaintiff in his office for the purpose of forcing the plaintiff to participate in an employment-related internal investigation.\u201d The plaintiff asserts that his claim \u201cis based on [Myrdek\u2019s] refusal to recognize [his] right to discontinue [the] investigatory interview and leave based on (1) his right to union representation, and (2) his right to resign immediately.\u201d Thus, he argues, \u201cMyrdek\u2019s demand that [he] submit to an interview prior to 3:00 p.m. . . . resulted in multiple instances of unlawful confinement ... in violation of [his] constitutional rights.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b92-10\">The plaintiff acknowledges that his first two encounters with Myrdek \u2014 at 2:05 p.m., when he received the <em>Garrity </em>warning, and at approximately 2:30 p.m., when he returned to Myrdek\u2019s office to report on his efforts to arrange union representation \u2014 \u201care not and never were part of [his] claim of false imprisonment.\u201d Rather, he asserts that his \u201cunlawful confinement started during his third meeting in Myrdek\u2019s office, which began at 2:45 to 3:00 p.m., and then continued into the hallway.\u201d (Emphasis omitted.) Thus, we limit our qualified immunity analysis to the third meeting beginning at approximately 2:45 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>\u201cThe doctrine of qualified immunity provides a safe harbor for public officials acting under the color of state law who would otherwise be liable under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 for infringing the constitutional rights of private parties.\u201d <em>Whitfield v. Melendez-Rivera, </em>431 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 2005). Qualified immunity protects police officers \u201cfrom liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\u201d <em>Mlodzinski v. Lewis, </em>648 F.3d 24, 32 (1st Cir. 2011) (quotation omitted). The doctrine \u201cbalances two important interests \u2014 the need to hold public officials accountable when they exercise power irresponsibly and the need to shield officials from harassment, distraction, and liability when they perform their duties reasonably.\u201d <em>Pearson v. Callahan, </em>555 U.S. 223, 231 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">\u201cThe protection of qualified immunity applies regardless of whether the government official\u2019s error is a mistake of law, a mistake of fact, or a mistake based on mixed questions of law and fact.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). The doctrine \u201cis a compromise that strives to balance the desire to compensate those whose rights are infringed by state actors with an equally compelling desire to shield public servants from undue interference with the performance of their duties and from threats of liability which, although unfounded, may nevertheless be unbearably disruptive.\u201d <em>Whitfield, </em>431 F.3d at 6 (quotation and brackets omitted). Qualified immunity \u201cprovides ample protection to all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law.\u201d <em>Malley v. Briggs, </em>475 U.S. 335, 341 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">The qualified immunity inquiry is comprised of a two-part test. <em>See Maldonado, </em>568 F.3d at 268-69. Pursuant to that test, a court must decide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-7\">(1) whether the facts alleged or shown by the plaintiff make out a violation of a constitutional right; and (2) if so, whether the right was \u201cclearly established\u201d at the time of the defendant\u2019s alleged violation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-8\">It is clear from the Supreme Court\u2019s description of the second, \u201cclearly established\u201d step of the qualified immunity analysis that the second step, in turn, has two aspects. One aspect of the analysis focuses on the clarity of the law at the time of the alleged civil rights violation____The other aspect focuses more concretely on the facts of the particular case and whether a reasonable defendant would have understood that his conduct violated the plaintiff[\u2019s] constitutional rights.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b94-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 269 (citations omitted). \u201cIf even on plaintiff\u2019s] best case, there is no violation of [his] rights, or the law was not clearly established, or an objectively reasonable officer could have concluded (even mistakenly) that his or her conduct did not violate [the plaintiffs] rights, then qualified immunity must be granted.\u201d <em>Mlodzinski, </em>648 F.3d at 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">\u201c[W]hile it is frequently appropriate for courts to answer each step in turn, it is not mandatory that courts follow the two-step analysis sequentially.\u201d <em>Maldonado, </em>568 F.3d at 269-70. Courts may exercise discretion in deciding which of the prongs \u201cof the qualified immunity analysis should be addressed first in light of the circumstances in the particular case at hand.\u201d <em>Pearson, </em>555 U.S. at 236; <em>see Tolan v. Cotton, </em>134 S. Ct. 1861, 1866 (2014). In some cases, \u201cdiscussion of the first prong of the qualified immunity analysis will result in a substantial expenditure of scarce judicial resources on difficult questions that have no effect on the outcome of the case.\u201d <em>Maldonado, </em>568 F.3d at 270 (quotation omitted). \u201cThis expenditure of resources by the courts and the parties is difficult to justify in cases where the constitutional questions presented are heavily fact-bound, minimizing their precedential value.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">For purposes of its qualified immunity analysis, the trial court assumed that the plaintiff had established \u201ca cognizable constitutional violation under the Fourth Amendment.\u201d On appeal, Myrdek likewise assumes that the plaintiff has \u201csatisfied the first prong of the test.\u201d Accordingly, we will assume, without deciding, that Myrdek\u2019s conduct violated the plaintiffs Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable seizure.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">Under the second prong of the qualified immunity analysis, the trial court determined that the plaintiffs right to be free from confinement under the circumstances in this case \u201cwas not clearly established,\u201d and that \u201cthe officers had a reasonable basis to believe that their conduct was lawful.\u201d The plaintiff asserts that because the jury rendered a verdict in his favor on the false imprisonment claim, it necessarily found: that his resignation was valid and not tainted by the defendants\u2019 suggestion that it was \u201cirrational\u201d; that the circumstances presented \u201cdid not give rise to a reasonable suspicion that [he] presented an immediate danger of bodily harm to himself or others prior to his detention\u201d; and that \u201cMyrdek did not have an objectively reasonable basis ... to believe that there was any emergency at hand which necessitated restraining [his] liberty.\u201d (Emphases and quotation omitted.) The plaintiff argues that the trial court \u201csimply ignored\u201d the jury\u2019s findings that Myrdek\u2019s conduct was not objectively reasonable. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-8\">The linchpin of qualified immunity is the objective reasonableness of the official\u2019s conduct. <em>Anderson v. Creighton, </em>483 U.S. 635, 638-39 (1987). In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number><em>Anderson, </em>the plaintiffs argued that it was \u201cinappropriate to give officials alleged to have violated the Fourth Amendment \u2014 and thus necessarily to have <em>unreasonably </em>searched or seized \u2014 the protection of a qualified immunity intended only to protect reasonable official action\u201d because, they asserted, it is impossible \u201cto say that one \u2018reasonably\u2019 acted unreasonably.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 643. The United States Supreme Court rejected this argument, stating: \u201cThe short answer to this argument is that it is foreclosed by the fact that we have previously extended qualified immunity to officials who were alleged to have violated the Fourth Amendment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, even if an officer is found to have acted unlawfully, <em>\u201cAnderson </em>still operates to grant officers immunity for reasonable mistakes as to the legality of their actions.\u201d <em>Saucier v. Katz, </em>533 U.S. 194, 206 (2001). \u201cThis test imposes an objective standard of reasonableness.\u201d <em>Mlodzinski, </em>648 F.3d at 33; <em>see Harlow v. Fitzgerald, </em>457 U.S. 800, 818 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">The plaintiff argues that, during his third meeting with Myrdek, which began at 2:45 to 3:00 p.m., \u201cMyrdek did not have any objectively reasonable basis to confine [him] to his office,\u201d and that Myrdek\u2019s \u201conly \u2018purpose\u2019 was to unlawfully compel [him] to submit to a no-notice interview without the union counsel he was legally entitled to.\u201d The plaintiff asserts that he \u201csimply refused to answer questions at 3 p.m. without his union representative being present which is lawful and appropriate behavior under the defendants\u2019 own rules.\u201d (Emphasis omitted.) Myrdek argues that the plaintiff \u201cprovides no legal support for his argument that [he] had an \u2018absolute right\u2019 to have the union <em>attorney, </em>as opposed to any other union representative, present at the administrative interview.\u201d Myrdek asserts that \u201c[b]ased on the information available to [him] at the time, he reasonably believed that the interview should not be delayed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">The State Police \u201cProfessional Standards of Conduct\u201d (standards) set forth the procedures applicable to \u201cinternal affairs investigations concerning allegations of personnel misconduct.\u201d Pursuant to section 26-E.4.5, C, \u201cDivision Member Rights and Responsibilities\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-7\">1. Division members under administrative investigation shall have the right to association or union representation during an investigative interview, if so requested by the member, whenever the member reasonably believes that the interview may result in disciplinary action against him. The association or union representative\u2019s role at the investigative interview is to consult with the Division member. The association or union representative shall not participate in the interview in any way unless requested to do so by the investigator and shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>not convert the interview into an adversary proceeding. The Division is free to insist upon hearing the Division member\u2019s own account of the matter(s) under investigation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-4\">The Division member is solely responsible for making arrangements to have an association or union representative in attendance at the interview. Under no circumstances will the investigation be compromised or unreasonably delayed because of the Division member\u2019s, association\u2019s or union\u2019s failure to obtain or provide an association or union representative in a timely manner. 2.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">Thus, under section 26-E.4.5, C of the standards, assuming that the plaintiff reasonably believed that the interview with Myrdek might result in disciplinary action against him, the plaintiff had a right to \u201cassociation or union representation\u201d during the investigative interview. However, there is no mention in the standards of a right to specific representation by an individual of the member\u2019s choosing, nor does the plaintiff cite any authority in support of his position that he was legally entitled to have the union <em>attorney </em>present at his interview. <em>Cf. Appeal of Exeter Police Assoc., </em>154 N.H. 61, 64 (2006) (declining to express opinion on whether New Hampshire law affords an employee the right to reqhest the union representative of one\u2019s choice); <em>see Anderson, </em>483 U.S. at 639 (explaining that application of qualified immunity \u201cturns on the objective legal reasonableness of the action assessed in light of the legal rules that were clearly established at the time it was taken\u201d) (quotations and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">Further, the policy expressly provides that the investigation not be \u201ccompromised or unreasonably delayed\u201d because of the member\u2019s failure to obtain \u201can association or union representative in a timely manner.\u201d At the time of the third meeting with the plaintiff on November 28, Myrdek was: aware of the events that had taken place in September regarding the plaintiffs actions involving the Meredith Police Department; aware of events that had resulted in the plaintiff being placed on administrative leave in October; aware that two days before, the plaintiffs wife had called the Laconia Police Department after arguing with her husband, requesting additional patrols by her home; aware that the plaintiffs wife had expressed concern that the plaintiff had been in her home in violation of a temporary order; and aware that the plaintiff had told his wife he knew where her attorney lived. Based upon the facts known to him at the time, it was objectively reasonable for Myrdek to conclude that insisting that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>investigatory interview take place that day, and that the plaintiff arrange for union representation other than Donchess, did not violate the plaintiff\u2019s rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">The plaintiff further argues that \u201cany reasonable officer in Myrdek\u2019s position ... would have recognized that he had no reasonable, lawful basis to compel [him] to participate in a <em>Garrity </em>internal investigatory interview contrary to ... his right to resign his employment and leave.\u201d We disagree. When Myrdek informed the plaintiff that the investigatory interview was going to take place that day, the plaintiff became enraged and tried to hand Myrdek a resignation letter. When Myrdek refused to accept it, the plaintiff responded, \u2018Well, F you . . . I\u2019m leaving, I quit.\u201d Myrdek testified that he didn\u2019t accept the plaintiff\u2019s resignation \u201cbecause [he] felt that in [the plaintiff\u2019s] state of rage that he ... seemed to be ... going out of control, and [he] didn\u2019t think that [the plaintiff] was at that point making a rational decision.\u201d Faced with the fact that the plaintiff\u2019s behavior had rapidly escalated to an enraged state, it was objectively reasonable for Myrdek to consider the plaintiff\u2019s offer to resign as not the product of a rational act.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">We reject the plaintiff\u2019s contention that prior to 3 p.m. Myrdek was not acting as a \u201cpolice officer,\u201d but rather \u201cwas acting solely in his capacity as the employer.\u201d Such a characterization ignores that, at all times relevant to the issues before us, both Myrdek and the plaintiff were armed, on-duty law enforcement officers, a factor that necessarily informed Myrdek\u2019s actions. For example, explaining why he declined to accept the plaintiff\u2019s offer to hand over his gun during the \u201cvery quick\u201d third meeting in his office, Myrdek testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-7\">[I was] concerned about . . . taking . . . [the plaintiff\u2019s] weapon away from him. But I was contemplating maybe just disarming that weapon by just removing the magazine, which would make the weapon unserviceable. In other words, you couldn\u2019t fire the weapon if I had just removed the magazine. And I was contemplating, at what point do I do this? Is this going to excite him even more? Will I be able to calm him down? So I was going through a number of scenarios that I was trying to determine what to do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-8\">I had concerns the entire time as to what point do I try to remove that weapon from him without exciting him any further? And trying to calm him down at the same time. And I was trying to balance out how to do that and when to do that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b97-9\">\u201cThe calculus of reasonableness must embody allowance for the fact that police officers are often forced to make split-second judgments \u2014 in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>circumstances that are tense, uncertain, and rapidly evolving[.]\u201d <em>Graham v. Connor, </em>490 U.S. 386, 396-97 (1989). An officer who makes \u201ca reasonable judgment call\u201d is entitled to qualified immunity. <em>Buchanan v. Maine, </em>469 F.3d 158, 170 (1st Cir. 2006); <em>see Saucier, </em>533 U.S. at 205 (cautioning against \u201cthe 20/20 vision of hindsight in favor of deference to the judgment of reasonable officers on the scene\u201d (quotation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">We conclude that an objectively reasonable officer could have believed that refusing to postpone the plaintiffs investigatory interview and refusing to accept the plaintiffs resignation were lawful. Thus, \u201ceven on plaintiff[\u2019s] best case ... an objectively reasonable officer could have concluded (even mistakenly) that his . . . conduct did not violate [the plaintiffs] rights.\u201d <em>Mlodzinski, </em>648 F.3d at 28. Accordingly, we hold that Myrdek was entitled to qualified immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">The plaintiff further argues that the trial court erroneously concluded that he was not entitled to a jury trial on his section 1983 claim. However, given our conclusion that the trial court correctly determined that Myrdek was entitled to qualified immunity on the section 1983 claim, we need not address this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">\n<em>VI. Sovereign Immunity</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b98-8\">The trial court concluded that NHDS was entitled to sovereign immunity and Myrdek was entitled to official immunity on the false imprisonment claim. On appeal, the plaintiff does not challenge the court\u2019s ruling that Myrdek was entitled to official immunity; therefore, we limit our review to whether the trial court erred in granting a directed verdict in favor of NHDS on grounds of sovereign immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-9\">The plaintiff argues that under the circumstances, his approximately two-hour detention at state police headquarters was unreasonable because the defendants did not initiate an Involuntary Emergency Admission (IE A) process, and \u201cthe defendants created their own alleged \u2018caretaker role\u2019 and then tried to get out of it.\u201d NHDS argues that the record supports the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the officers acted -within the scope of their employment and reasonably believed that their acts were lawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-10\">\u201cThe doctrine of sovereign immunity is deeply entrenched in this jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>126 N.H. 554, 557 (1985) (quotation omitted). \u201cSovereign immunity is a jurisdictional question not to.be waived by conduct or undermined by estoppel.\u201d <em>LaRoche, </em>134 N.H. at 566 (quotation omitted). It is not a defense which must be affirmatively pled. <em>Id. </em>As noted above, sovereign immunity is a question of law which we review <em>de novo.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b99-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>In enacting RSA chapter 541-B, the legislature waived the State\u2019s sovereign immunity, subject to several exceptions. One such exception is contained in RSA 541-B:19,1(d) (2007), which provides that the State has immunity from</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-5\">[a]ny claim arising out of an intentional tort, including . . . false imprisonment... provided that the employee whose conduct gives rise to the claim reasonably believes, at the time of the acts or omissions complained of, that his conduct was lawful, and provided further that the acts complained of were within the scope of official duties of the employee for the state.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">Thus, to establish the State\u2019s intentional tort liability, a plaintiff must prove that, while acting within the scope of his official duties, the offending State employee lacked a reasonable belief in the lawfulness of his conduct. As we have explained, \u201c[t]o hold the State liable when the employee or official reasonably believes that his conduct conforms to the law would in our opinion have a chilling effect on the morale and motivation of government personnel.\u201d <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>126 N.H. at 564. \u201cGiven the societal importance of maintaining vigilant government personnel, we believe that the State is not constitutionally compelled to expose itself to liability for intentional torts committed by government officials or employees who act under a reasonable belief in the lawfulness of their conduct.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">The trial court concluded that \u201cthe NHDS officers acted within the scope of their duties\u201d under RSA 541-B: 19, 1(d), both \u201cin their capacity as employers\u201d and \u201cwithin their law enforcement capacities.\u201d The record supports the trial court\u2019s conclusion and the plaintiff does not argue otherwise. Accordingly, the statutory requirement that \u201cthe acts complained of were within the scope of official duties of the employee for the state\u201d is satisfied. RSA 541-B:19, 1(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-8\">The trial court also found that \u201can objective analysis compels a finding that the NHDS officers had a reasonable basis to believe that their conduct\u201d in confining the plaintiff to police headquarters until the Concord police arrived \u201cwas lawful,\u201d based upon a reasonable concern \u201cabout the safety of the plaintiff and others based on the plaintiff\u2019s manifest behavior.\u201d The plaintiff argues that under the circumstances, the NHDS officers\u2019 conduct was unreasonable because they did not initiate an IEA even though they detained him. NHDS argues that based upon the plaintiff\u2019s conduct and demeanor, it was reasonable to believe that he posed an immediate danger of bodily injury to himself and should be held in protective custody until a determination could be made as to whether an IEA should be ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>Pursuant to RSA 135-C:28, III (Supp. 2013):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-5\">When a peace officer observes a person engaging in behavior which gives the peace officer reasonable suspicion to believe that the person may be suffering from a mental illness and probable cause to believe that unless the person is placed in protective custody the person poses an immediate danger of bodily injury to himself or others, the police officer may place the person in protective custody. Any person taken into protective custody under this paragraph shall be transported directly to an emergency room of a licensed general hospital... for the purpose of determining if an involuntary emergency admission shall be ordered .... The period of protective custody shall end when a physician or [advanced registered nurse practitioner] makes a determination as to whether involuntary emergency admission shall be ordered or at the end of 6 hours, whichever event occurs first.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">The plaintiff testified that during the approximately two-hour period when he was held in custody by NHDS, he was \u201cangry,\u201d \u201cdepressed,\u201d and \u201csuicidal.\u201d According to the testimony of the officers who were with the plaintiff in Myrdek\u2019s office, the plaintiff threatened to take one of the officer\u2019s guns away from him. The plaintiff said to another officer that he was going to make that officer shoot him. At one point, the plaintiff got \u201cinto a fighting stance in which he ... had one fist clenched, the other fist open.\u201d Captain Allen Welch testified that the plaintiff threatened to jump out the window and commit suicide, causing Welch to draw his taser.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">Forey testified that during the struggle in the hallway, the plaintiff was \u201cclearly a dangerous person at that point.\u201d She testified that she was \u201cconcerned with his mindset and the fact that [they were] all wearing weapons,\u201d and \u201cconcerned for the safety of the civilians\u201d in the building, and she testified that \u201che was a threat to himself and others.\u201d Welch, who stayed in Myrdek\u2019s office with the plaintiff, testified that the plaintiff \u201chad lost control of himself emotionally and physically\u201d and needed to be in custody that afternoon. Welch testified that his \u201csole goal in this entire incident was to get out of there with nobody getting hurt.\u201d Corporal Stephen Barrett, who was also in Myrdek\u2019s office with the plaintiff, testified that he was concerned that, if allowed to leave, the plaintiff might harm himself or his wife. Barrett testified that, in his thirty years as a state trooper, he had never witnessed a physical .altercation between a trooper and his superior resulting in restraint, or a fellow trooper saying that he wanted to kill himself or wanted to be shot.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>The policy considerations that support shielding police officers from liability in the related context of official immunity are important and worth repeating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-5\">Police officers are trusted with one of the most basic and necessary functions of civilized society, securing and preserving public safety.... Police officers are regularly called upon to utilize judgment and discretion in the performance of their duties. They must make decisions and take actions which have serious consequences and repercussions to the individuals immediately involved, to the public at large and to themselves.
