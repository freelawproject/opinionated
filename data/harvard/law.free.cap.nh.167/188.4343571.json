The plaintiffs and the intervenors cross-appeal the court\u2019s ruling that members\u2019 rights to retirement benefits do not vest until they accrue ten years of creditable service. For reasons set forth below, we reverse the court\u2019s Contract Clause ruling and remand. Accordingly, we need not address the issue raised in the cross-appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-8\">The following undisputed facts are supported by the record. In 2011, the legislature amended RSA 100-A:16,1(a) by increasing the following contribution rates for New Hampshire Retirement System (NHRS) members: for Group I members the rate increased from 5 percent to 7 percent; for Group II permanent fire fighter members the rate increased from 9.3 percent to 11.80 percent; and for Group II permanent police members the rate increased from 9.3 percent to 11.55 percent. Laws 2011, 224:172; <em>see </em>RSA 100-A:16, 1(a) (Supp. 2010) (amended 2011). In June 2011, the Professional Fire Fighters of New Hampshire, the New Hampshire Police Association, the National Education Association \u2014 New Hampshire, and the State Employees Association of New Hampshire \u2014 SEIU Local 1984 filed a petition for declaratory and injunctive relief challenging the constitutionality of the changes to the statute. The petition was twice amended to add six individual plaintiffs. In addition to claims against the State, the petition included a claim against the Commissioner of the New Hampshire Department of Administrative Services. However, the plaintiffs subsequently filed a voluntary nonsuit without prejudice with respect to such claim. Accordingly, the only defendant in this appeal is the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-9\">The petition alleged, among other things, that \u201c[mjembers become vested in their NHRS benefits upon commencement of permanent employee status\u201d and that \u201cupon vesting, their contribution rates may not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>increased without a commensurate benefit.\u201d (Quotation omitted.) The plaintiffs argued that the legislative change to RSA 100-A:16, 1(a) \u201csubstantially impairs the members\u2019 rights\u201d and that \u201c[t]he substantial impairment is neither reasonable nor necessary to serve an important public interest,\u201d thereby violating the Contract Clauses of the New Hampshire and Federal Constitutions. <em>See </em>N.H. CONST, pt. I, art. 23; U.S. CONST, art. 1, \u00a7 10. The State moved to dismiss, arguing that: there is no Contract Clause violation because RSA chapter 100-A does not constitute a contract between the parties; even if RSA chapter 100-A includes sections that give rise to a contract, there is no contract right to a permanent, fixed employee contribution rate; and even if the statute includes sections that give rise to a contract, the contract is not formed until the employee \u201cvests,\u201d as defined in RSA 100-A10 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">The trial court dismissed the four non-individual plaintiffs for lack of standing, but allowed them to proceed as intervenors. The State does not challenge this ruling on appeal. Thus, we assume, without deciding, that the non-individual plaintiffs have standing to be intervenors. <em>See G2003B, LLC v. Town of Weare, </em>153 N.H. 725, 727 (2006). The trial court denied the motion to dismiss as to the individual plaintiffs, finding that, pursuant to RSA 100-A.10,1, \u201cthe legislature intended that public employees\u2019 pension rights ... vest after ten years of creditable service, and that after vesting the State is contractually bound to honor its obligation to provide a pension without any modification or decrease in benefits.\u201d The court also found that the increase in members\u2019 contribution rates constitutes a substantial impairment \u201cbecause it requires employees, who have already met the requisite service and age requirements, to pay additional amounts . . . without receiving additional benefit.\u201d Accordingly, the court concluded that \u201cRSA 100-A creates a contract between vested employees and the State, and the .. . modification in the employee contribution rate is a substantial modification of that contract, in violation of both the United States and New Hampshire Constitutions with respect to employees who have met the service requirements of RSA 100-A:10.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">The parties thereafter filed cross-motions for summary judgment. The State argued that \u201c[g]iven the historical changes to the employee contribution rates, combined with the absence of any language reflecting constitutional contractual rights associated with employee contribution rates,\u201d the legislature had not \u201cevinced a clear intent to create contractual rights binding on successive legislatures against modification of [such] rates.\u201d The State asserted that \u201c[e]ven if RSA 100-A creates a contractual interest upon vesting, its contractual obligation is to provide a pension as it exists ... on a certain day, but does not prohibit changes to the system going forward,\u201d and that \u201c[t]he legislature should not... be prohibited from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>changing that retirement system going forward, while at the same time guaranteeing as unchanged the pension benefit that has accrued up until that point.\u201d The plaintiffs and intervenors (collectively, the plaintiffs) argued that, based upon <em>Cloutier v. State, </em>163 N.H. 445 (2012), the trial court should \u201crevisit its decision as to when vesting occurs..., and find that vesting occurs when an NHRS member obtains permanent employment status.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">The trial court denied the plaintiffs\u2019 cross-motion, affirming its earlier ruling that benefits vest after ten years of creditable service. The court rejected the plaintiffs\u2019 reliance upon <em>Cloutier, </em>noting that <em>Cloutier </em>was \u201cbased on an interpretation of a wholly different statute \u2014 RSA chapter 100-C \u2014 and specifically, other pertinent language,\u201d including that the judges subject to that statute were entitled to retirement benefits as \u201cadditional compensation for services . rendered and <em>to be rendered!\u2019 </em>(Quotation omitted.) The trial court also denied the State\u2019s cross-motion, rejecting its argument that the legislature had not demonstrated an unmistakable intent to bind future legislatures to particular contribution rates. Because only three of the six individual plaintiffs had served their ten years of creditable service prior to the effective date of the 2011 statutory changes, the trial court granted summary judgment for the three \u201cvested\u201d plaintiffs and denied summary judgment for the other individual plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">On appeal, the State argues, among other things, that the trial court erred by ruling that NHRS members have a contractual right to a fixed contribution rate. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">In reviewing the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, we consider all evidence presented in the record, and all inferences properly drawn therefrom, in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. <em>See City of Concord v. State of N.H., </em>164 N.H. 130, 133 (2012). We will affirm the grant of summary judgment only if our review of that evidence discloses no genuine issue of material fact, and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Antosz v. Allain, </em>163 N.H. 298, 299 (2012). We review the trial court\u2019s application of the law to the facts <em>de novo. Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">Whether or not a statute is constitutional is a question of law, which we review <em>de novo. Tuttle v. N.H. Med. Malpractice Joint Underwriting Assoc., </em>159 N.H. 627, 640 (2010).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-8\">The party challenging a statute\u2019s constitutionality bears the burden of proof. The constitutionality of an act passed by the coordinate branch of the government is to be presumed. It will not be declared to be invalid except upon inescapable grounds; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>the operation under it of another department of the state government will not be interfered with until the matter has received full and deliberate consideration.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b213-5\"><em>Id. </em>(quotations, citations and brackets omitted). \u201cWhen doubts exist as to the constitutionality of a statute, those doubts must be resolved in favor of its constitutionality.\u201d <em>Bd. of Trustees, N.H. Judicial Ret. Plan v. Sec\u2019y of State, </em>161 N.H. 49, 53 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">The Contract Clause of the United States Constitution provides: \u201cNo state shall... pass any ... law impairing the obligation of contracts ....\u201d U.S. CONST, art. I, \u00a7 10. Part I, Article 23 of the New Hampshire Constitution provides: \u201cRetrospective laws are highly injurious, oppressive, and unjust. No such laws, therefore, should be made, either for the decision of civil causes, or the punishment of offenses\u201d\u2019 N.H. CONST, pt. I, art. 23. Although Part I, Article 23 \u201cdoes not expressly reference existing contracts ... , we have held that its proscription duplicates the protections found in the contract clause of the United States Constitution.\u201d <em>State v. Fournier, </em>158 N.H. 214,221 (2009) (quotation omitted). \u201cWe... understand article I, section 10 [of the Federal Constitution] and part I, article 23 [of the State Constitution] to offer equivalent protections where a law impairs a contract, or where a law abrogates an earlier statute that is itself a contract.\u201d <em>Opinion of the Justices (Furlough), </em>135 N.H. 625, 630 (1992). Thus, \u201cevery statute which takes away or impairs vested rights, acquired under existing laws, or creates a new obligation, imposes a new duty, or attaches a new disability, in respect to transactions or considerations already past, must be deemed retrospective\u201d within the meaning of Part I, Article 23. <em>Tuttle, </em>159 N.H. at 641 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">When evaluating a Contract Clause claim, a court must first determine \u201cwhether a change in state law has resulted in the substantial impairment of a contractual relationship.\u201d <em>Parker v. Wakelin, </em>123 F.3d 1, 4-5 (1st Cir. 1997) (quotations omitted). This inquiry, in turn, has \u201cthree components: whether there is a contractual relationship, whether a change in law impairs that contractual relationship, and whether the impairment is substantial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 5 (quotation omitted). To survive a Contract Clause challenge, a legislative enactment that constitutes a substantial impairment of a contractual relationship \u201cmust have a significant and legitimate public purpose.\u201d <em>Energy Reserves Group v. Kansas Power &amp; Light, </em>459 U.S. 400, 411 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-8\"> \u201cA party alleging that contractual rights arose from a statutory enactment faces a heavy burden.\u201d <em>Maine Ass\u2019n of Retirees v. Board of Trustees, </em>758 F.3d 23, 29 (1st Cir. 2014). \u201c[W]here a public contract allegedly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>arises out of statutory language, the hurdle under the first component of the first part of the test \u2014 proving that a contractual relationship exists \u2014 is necessarily higher, since normally state statutory enactments do not of their own force create a contract with those whom the statute benefits.\u201d <em>Parella v. R.I. Employees\u2019 Retirement System, </em>173 F.3d 46, 60 (1st Cir. 1999) (quotation omitted). As the United States Supreme Court has explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-4\">[T]he principal function of a legislature is not to make contracts, but to make laws that establish the policy of the state. Policies, unlike contracts, are inherently subject to revision and repeal, and to construe laws as contracts when the obligation is not clearly and unequivocally expressed would be to limit drastically the essential powers of a legislative body.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b214-5\"><em>National R. Passenger Corp. v. A. T. &amp; S. F. R. Co., </em>470 U.S. 451, 466 (1985) (citation omitted). Thus, \u201cabsent some clear indication that the legislature intends to bind itself contractually, the presumption is that a law is not intended to create private contractual or vested rights but merely declares a policy to be pursued until the legislature shall ordain otherwise.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 465-66 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">\u201cThis threshold requirement for the recognition of public contracts has been referred to as the \u2018unmistakability doctrine.\u2019 \u201d <em>Parker, </em>123 F.3d at 5. The doctrine \u201cserve[s] the dual purposes of limiting contractual incursions on a State\u2019s sovereign powers and of avoiding difficult constitutional questions about the extent of state authority to limit the subsequent exercise of legislative power.\u201d <em>United States v. Winstar Corp., </em>518 U.S. 839, 875 (1996) (plurality opinion). Because we have consistently held that the proscription contained in Part I, Article 23 \u201cduplicates the protections found in the contract clause of the United States Constitution,\u201d <em>Opinion of the Justices (Furlough), </em>135 N.H. at 630, we here adopt the unmistakability doctrine. <em>See Tuttle, </em>159 N.H. at 641 (Federal and State Contract Clauses offer \u201cequivalent protections\u201d (quotation omitted)). We first address the State\u2019s argument under the State Constitution and rely upon federal law only to aid our analysis. <em>See State v. Ball, </em>124 N.H. 226, 231-33 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">\u201c[T]he unmistakability doctrine mandates that we determine whether the challenged legislative enactment evinces the clear intent of the state to be bound to particular contractual obligations.\u201d <em>Parker, </em>123 F.3d at 7. \u201cWhen reviewing a particular enactment, therefore, we must suspend judgment and proceed cautiously both in identifying a contract within the language of a regulatory statute and in defining the contours of any contractual obligation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 7-8 (quotation omitted). The first step is to examine the statutory language itself. <em>National, </em>470 U.S. at 466.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>Prior to the 2011 amendments, RSA 100-A-.16,1(a) provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-5\">The member annuity savings fund shall be a fund in which shall be accumulated the contributions deducted from the compensation of members to provide for their member annuities together with any amounts transferred thereto from a similar fund under one or more of the predecessor systems. Such contribution shall be, for each member, dependent upon the member\u2019s employment classification at the rate determined in accordance with the following table:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-7\">Employees of employers other than the state 5.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-8\">Employees of the state hired on or before June 30, 2009 5.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AE\">Employees of the state hired after June 30, 2009 7.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-9\">Teachers 5.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-10\">Permanent Policemen 9.30</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-11\">Permanent Firemen 9.30</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-12\">RSA 100-A:16,1(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-13\">The trial court determined that pursuant to RSA 100-A:10, I, \u201cthe legislature intended that public employees\u2019 pension rights... vest after ten years of creditable service,\u201d and, therefore, that the legislature\u2019s \u201cmodification in the employee contribution rate is a substantial modification of that contract.\u201d However, the statutory amendment at issue \u2014 RSA 100-A-.16, 1(a) \u2014 does not retroactively affect NHRS member contribution rates. The narrow question before us is whether, by enacting RSA 100-A:16,1(a), the legislature unmistakably intended to establish NHRS member contribution rates as a contractual right that cannot be modified. We hold that it did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-14\">As the State points out, courts in other jurisdictions have concluded that a legislature is not constitutionally prohibited from increasing member contributions to a state retirement system. For example, the Michigan Supreme Court concluded that \u201can employee contribution rate increase of 5% without a corresponding increase in benefits\u201d would not violate that state\u2019s constitution. <em>In re Enrolled Senate Bill </em>1269,209 N.W.2d 200,201-02 (Mich. 1973). The court stated that although \u201cthe legislature cannot diminish or impair accrued financial benefits,... we think it may properly attach new conditions for earning financial benefits which have not yet accrued.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 202-03.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-15\">Similarly, the Florida Supreme Court, recognizing that the legislature has authority \u201cto amend a retirement plan prospectively, so long as any benefits tied to service performed prior to the amendment date are not lost or impaired,\u201d held that legislative amendments to the Florida Retirement System increasing employee contributions from zero to three percent \u201chave <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>not impaired any statutorily created contract rights.\u201d <em>Scott v. Williams, </em>107 So. 3d 379, 389 (Fla. 2013); <em>see also Taylor v. City of Gadsden, </em>958 F. Supp. 2d 1287, 1325 (N.D. Ala. 2013) (\u201cthere is no indication that the legislature . . . unmistakably has bound itself to <em>never </em>changing the contribution rate\u201d), <em>aff'd, </em>767 F.3d 1124 (11th Cir. 2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">We hold that there is no indication that in enacting RSA 100-A:16 the legislature unmistakably intended to bind itself from prospectively changing the rate of NHRS member contributions to the retirement system. Because the Federal Constitution affords the plaintiffs no greater protection than does the State Constitution in these circumstances, we reach the same conclusion under the Federal Constitution as we do under the State Constitution. <em>See Maine Ass\u2019n of Retirees, </em>758 F.3d at 29. Accordingly, we reverse the trial court\u2019s ruling that the 2011 amendment to RSA 100-A:16, 1(a) violated the Contract Clauses of the State and Federal Constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b216-7\">Hicks, Conboy, Lynn, and Bassett, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
