West, II, was convicted on three counts of simple assault and one count of resisting arrest or detention. RSA 631:2-a (2007); RSA 642:2 (Supp. 2014). During trial, the defendant objected to the trial court\u2019s proposed jury instruction on the defense of premises, RSA 627:7 (2007). The trial court overruled the defendant\u2019s objection. Additionally, at the close of the State\u2019s case, the defendant moved to dismiss the resisting arrest or detention charge, arguing that the State presented no evidence that the police officer attempted to arrest or detain the defendant. The trial court denied the motion. On appeal, the defendant argues that the trial court erred: (1) by instructing the jury that the defendant must exhaust all non-violent alternatives before using force in defense of premises; and (2) by denying his motion to dismiss the resisting arrest or detention charge for insufficient evidence. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-13\">The jury could have found, or the record establishes, the following facts. Shortly after midnight on December 19, 2012, Officer St. Onge of the Deerfield Police Department was dispatched to the defendant\u2019s house in response to a 9-1-1 call and hang-up that the dispatcher had received from the defendant\u2019s address. After ringing the doorbell, St. Onge knocked and announced himself as a police officer. After a short period, the defendant came to the door. St. Onge shined his flashlight on his uniform and badge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>to show that he was a police officer. St. Onge told the defendant that the dispatcher had received a 9-1-1 call, and the defendant stated that he did not call 9-1-1. St. Onge asked if he could come inside the residence and the defendant declined. The defendant then closed the storm door. As the defendant was closing the interior door, St. Onge reached for the handle of the storm door. The defendant then charged at St. Onge, knocking him off the landing by the front door, down five or six steps, and onto the walkway. The defendant landed on top of St. Onge and punched him in the face several times.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">The altercation continued for a few minutes, with St. Onge and the defendant exchanging punches. At one point, St. Onge was able to get out from under the defendant. However, St. Onge then fell backward onto the walkway. The defendant again charged at St. Onge and then sat astride St. Onge while striking him. As the defendant began to tire, St. Onge was able to grab hold of the defendant\u2019s hair. St. Onge stated, \u201cIf you let go of me, I\u2019ll let go of you.\u201d The defendant responded, \u2018You first,\u201d to which St. Onge replied, \u201cno.\u201d The defendant released St. Onge, who then rolled the defendant off and handcuffed him. The charges against the defendant stemmed from this incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">At trial, the defendant moved to dismiss the resisting arrest or detention charge, arguing that there was no evidence that St. Onge attempted to arrest or detain him. The trial court denied the motion, finding sufficient evidence for a reasonable juror to conclude that St. Onge was attempting to detain the defendant during the fight.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">At the conclusion of the trial, the trial court, over the defendant\u2019s objection, instructed the jury that the defendant could use force in defense of premises under RSA 627:7 \u201cif he actually believed there was an imminent danger of... St. Onge entering into the Defendant\u2019s dwelling without the Defendant\u2019s permission, and that the use of force was the only reasonable means of preventing that criminal trespass.\u201d The court further instructed that the defendant\u2019s belief must be reasonable, explaining \u201cthere must be reasonable grounds for the Defendant to believe that ... St. Onge was about to commit a criminal trespass into the dwelling, and that there were no reasonable alternatives to using force to prevent that criminal trespass.\u201d The court also instructed the jury that under RSA 627:7, \u201cthe [defendant] must reasonably believe that the criminal trespass is immediately forthcoming so that he has no opportunity to resort to the law for his protection.\u201d The jury convicted the defendant on all charges, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-8\">On appeal, the defendant argues that the trial court\u2019s jury instruction on defense of premises, requiring that no reasonable lawful alternatives to the use of force existed, was an improper interpretation of RSA 627:7. He contends that, in violation of his due process rights, the instruction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>effectively relieved the State of having to disprove his defense beyond.a reasonable doubt. The State counters that the defendant was not entitled to a defense of premises instruction in the first instance. Alternatively, the State maintains that the trial court\u2019s instruction accurately paraphrased RSA 627:7. The defendant also argues that the trial court erred in failing to dismiss the resisting arrest or detention charge because there was no evidence that St. Onge was attempting to arrest or detain him. The State contends that the evidence at trial was sufficient to support the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">As an initial matter, we note that the State argues that, because St. Onge was a police officer, the defendant was not entitled to a defense of premises instruction. <em>See State v. Haas, </em>134 N.H. 480, 484-85 (1991) (affirming trial court\u2019s refusal to instruct jury on defense of property where charged offense involved assault on police officer). However, we decline to consider the argument because the State failed to object to the instruction at trial. <em>See, e.g., State v. Cheney, </em>165 N.H. 677, 679 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">We next turn to the substance of the jury instruction. \u201cThe purpose of the trial court\u2019s charge is to state and explain to the jury, in clear and intelligible language, the rules of law applicable to the case.\u201d <em>State 1). Etienne, </em>163 N.H. 57, 70 (2011) (quotation omitted). \u201cWhen reviewing jury instructions, we evaluate allegations of error by interpreting the disputed instructions in their entirety, as a reasonable juror would have understood them, and in light of all the evidence in the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). \u2018We determine whether the jury instructions adequately and accurately explain each element of the offense and reverse only if the instructions did not fairly cover the issues of law in the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). \u2018Whether a particular jury instruction is necessary, and the scope and wording of jury instructions, are within the sound discretion of the trial court, and we review the trial court\u2019s decisions on these matters for an unsustainable exercise of discretion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). \u201cTo show that the trial court\u2019s decision is not sustainable, the defendant must demonstrate that the court\u2019s ruling was clearly untenable or unreasonable to the prejudice of his case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). \u201cHowever, the interpretation of a statute is a question of law, which we review <em>de novo!\u2019 Id. </em>(quotation and brackets omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">The jury instruction at issue stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-8\">The Defendant must have actually believed that [St. Onge] was about to commit a criminal trespass in the Defendant\u2019s dwelling. In other words, the Defendant could use force if he actually believed there was an imminent danger of [St. Onge] entering into the Defendant\u2019s dwelling without the Defendant\u2019s permission, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number><em>and that the use of force was the only reasonable means of preventing that criminal trespass.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-5\">Even if the Defendant actually believed that such a danger existed, his belief must be reasonable. In other words, there must be reasonable grounds for the Defendant to believe that [St. Onge] was about to commit a criminal trespass into the dwelling, <em>and that there were no reasonable alternatives to using force to prevent that criminal trespass.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-6\">So for use of force in defense of dwelling to be justified, the person must have a reasonable belief that the danger presented is imminent and in the present. That is, the person must reasonably believe that the criminal trespass is immediately forthcoming <em>so that he has no opportunity to resort to the law for his protection.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">(Emphases added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">The defendant argues that the trial court incorrectly instructed the jury when it added \u201ca prerequisite to the exercise of the Defense of Premises... that the defendant must exhaust all non-violent remedies before resorting to force.\u201d The State counters that the instruction was an accurate statement of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-9\">The relevant portion of RSA 627:7 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-10\">A person in possession or control of premises or a person who is licensed or privileged to be thereon is justified in using non-deadly force upon another when and to the extent that he reasonably believes it necessary to prevent or terminate the commission of a criminal trespass by such other in or upon such premises ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b489-11\">At issue is the trial court\u2019s instruction as it relates to the phrase \u201creasonably believes it necessary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b489-12\">Contrary to the defendant\u2019s assertion, the trial court did not require that, in order for the defendant to invoke the defense of premises justification, he \u201cmust exhaust all non-violent remedies.\u201d Rather, the instruction was couched in terms of the defendant\u2019s belief at that time and the reasonableness of that belief, specifically that: \u201c[the defendant] <em>actually believed ... </em>that the use of force was the only reasonable means of preventing [the] criminal trespass\u201d; \u201cthere must <em>be reasonable grounds for the Defendant to believe . . . </em>that there were no reasonable alternatives to using force to prevent that criminal trespass\u201d; and \u201cthe [defendant] <em>must reasonably </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>believe... that he has no opportunity to resort to the law for his protection.\u201d (Emphases added.) The defendant argues that the instruction was erroneous because \u201ca reasonable juror could have concluded both that [the defendant] had acted reasonably in applying force and that [the defendant] could have exercised other, non-violent options.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">The defendant\u2019s interpretation of the trial court\u2019s instruction fails to consider the entirety of the instruction. The instruction did <em>not </em>foreclose the possibility that a jury could conclude that the defendant actually believed that force was necessary, and that such a belief, although incorrect, was nonetheless reasonable. For example, the jury might have found that the defendant, instead of charging at St. Onge, could have closed the front door to prevent St. Onge from entering the house. If a jury concluded that closing the door was a reasonable alternative, the jury could consider this in determining, whether, under all the circumstances, there were \u201creasonable grounds for the Defendant to believe ... that there were no reasonable alternatives to using force.\u201d <em>See State v. Leaf, </em>137 N.H. 97, 99 (1993) (\u201c[I]t is for the jury to determine whether the belief, even though honest, was in fact reasonable under <em>all the circumstances.\u201d </em>(emphasis added)). The instruction did not preclude the jury from finding in favor of the defendant in regard to defense of premises. Thus, the instruction actually given by the trial court simply does not support the interpretation advanced by the defendant: that the trial court instructed the jury that in order for the defendant to rely upon the defense of premises justification, he must have exhausted all non-violent alternatives before using force.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">Rather, the challenged instruction is a correct explanation of the requirement in RSA 627:7 that one using force must reasonably believe the use of force is necessary to prevent or terminate a criminal trespass. <em>See, e.g., State v. Bird, </em>161 N.H. 31, 36 (2010) (focusing the analysis upon \u201cwhether it was reasonable for the defendant to believe it necessary to use such force.\u201d). We note that the defendant has not argued on appeal that the challenged instruction was an improper articulation of what the term \u201cnecessary\u201d means under RSA 627:7.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">To the extent that the defendant argues that the trial court\u2019s instruction allowed the jury to make an after-the-fact determination of whether the defendant\u2019s actions were reasonable, we disagree. In its defense of premises instruction, the trial court told the jury that it was to \u201cconsider all the circumstances surrounding the incident... as they were presented to [the defendant] <em>at that time, </em>and not necessarily as they appear upon detached reflection.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Thus, the instruction did not allow the jury to assess the defendant\u2019s actions with the benefit of hindsight.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>Accordingly, for the foregoing reasons, reading the instruction in its entirety, we conclude that the defendant has not demonstrated that the instruction given by the trial court was clearly untenable or unreasonable to the prejudice of his case. Given this conclusion, we need not address the defendant\u2019s remaining arguments that are premised upon a finding that the instruction was incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">Although we conclude that the trial court did not err in its defense of premises instruction, we nonetheless choose to exercise our supervisory powers to provide guidance to the trial courts. <em>See, e.g., State v. Leveille, </em>160 N.H. 630, 633-34 (2010) (suggesting that the trial courts use the New Hampshire Model Jury Instructions when practicable). We recommend the following instruction be used when addressing the issue of whether a person \u201creasonably believes it necessary\u201d to use non-deadly force under RSA 627:7:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-6\">In order for the defendant\u2019s use of non-deadly force to be justified in defense of premises, the defendant must have actually and reasonably believed it was necessary to use non-deadly force to prevent or terminate the commission of a criminal trespass.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-7\">Thus, to find that the defendant was justified in using force, you must first find that the defendant actually believed that it was necessary to use force. Then you must find that, under all the circumstances, the defendant\u2019s actual belief was a reasonable belief. If the defendant\u2019s actual belief \u2014 that force was necessary \u2014 was not reasonable, you should not find his use of force was justified. In making this determination, you should consider whether the defendant had reasonable alternatives to the use of force. If the defendant knew or should have known that he had reasonable alternatives to the use of force, you should not find his use of force was justified. On the other hand, if the defendant reasonably, but incorrectly, believed that he had no reasonable alternative to the use of force, you must find that his use of force was justified.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">The defendant next argues that the evidence does not support his conviction for resisting arrest or detention. To prevail on this challenge, \u201cthe defendant must establish that no rational trier of fact, viewing all of the evidence and all reasonable inferences from it in the light most favorable to the State, could have found guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>State v. Fischer, </em>165 N.H. 706, 712 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-9\">Under RSA 642:2, a person is guilty of resisting arrest or detention when \u201cthe person knowingly or purposefully physically interferes with a person <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>recognized to be a law enforcement official. . . seeking to effect an arrest or detention of the person ...\u201d On appeal, the defendant argues that \u201cthe State failed to produce any evidence that St. Onge was attempting to effect an arrest or detention on [the defendant] while [the defendant] was sitting on top of him .. . .\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">\u201cA conviction for resisting arrest must rest upon conduct that occurs while law enforcement is seeking to effect an arrest or detention.\u201d <em>State v. Lindsey, </em>158 N.H. 708, 706 (2009) (quotation omitted). \u201cThe plain meaning of \u2018effect\u2019 includes: to cause to come into being; to bring about esp. through successful use of factors contributory to the result; ACCOMPLISH, EXECUTE.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). We have previously noted that the term \u201cdetain\u201d means \u201cto hold or keep in or as if in custody, to keep back, and to stop or delay.\u201d <em>State v. Kelley, </em>153 N.H. 481, 483 (2006) (quotation and brackets omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">The altercation between St. Onge and the defendant lasted a few minutes. At one point, St. Onge was holding onto the defendant by his hair, while the defendant was sitting astride St. Onge holding St: Onge\u2019s head to the ground. While the men were thus holding onto one another, St. Onge stated, \u201cIf you let go of me, I\u2019ll let go of you.\u201d The defendant did not release St. Onge, but rather replied, \u201cYou first.\u201d St. Onge then responded that he would not let go. It was after that statement by St. Onge that the defendant finally let go, and only then was St. Onge able to get out from under the defendant and place him in handcuffs. Given these facts, specifically St. Onge seizing the defendant by the hair during the course of the fight after having been knocked to the ground twice and hit repeatedly by the defendant, a reasonable juror could have found that St. Onge was attempting to detain the defendant. <em>See </em>RSA 642:2. The circumstances permit an inference that St. Onge was not only attempting to stop the assault, but also that he was attempting \u201cto hold [the defendant]... as if in custody.\u201d <em>Kelley, </em>153 N.H. at 483 (quotation omitted). Accordingly, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, we conclude that the defendant has not established that there was no evidence from which a rational trier of fact could have found guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b492-8\">Dalianis, C.J., and Hicks, J., concurred; Lynn, J., with whom CONBOY, J., joined, concurred in part and dissented in part.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b492-9\">LYNN, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AIn\">concurring in part and dissenting in part. I concur with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the trial court\u2019s jury instructions with respect to defense of premises were not erroneous, and I also agree with the proposed instruction the court recommends that trial courts utilize when defense of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>premises under RSA 627:7 (2007) is at issue. However, I disagree with the majority\u2019s holding that the evidence was sufficient to support the defendant\u2019s conviction for resisting arrest or detention, in violation of RSA 642:2 (Supp. 2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">To be guilty of violating RSA 642:2, there must be evidence that, at the time of the defendant\u2019s acts of physical interference with a person recognized to be a law enforcement officer, the officer was \u201cseeking to effect an arrest or detention of the person or another . . . .\u201d RSA 642:2. Here, there is no claim that Officer St. Onge came to the defendant\u2019s residence with the purpose of arresting or detaining anyone; his purpose was simply to investigate the 9-1-1 hang-up call. Nor does the State assert that St. Onge was attempting to arrest or detain the defendant when he reached for the handle of the storm door as the defendant was closing the interior door. Thus, the only basis upon which the resisting charge could be predicated is the officer\u2019s actions after the defendant attacked him and the two began struggling on the ground. The majority points to two factors as establishing the sufficiency of the evidence: (1) St. Onge\u2019s act of holding onto the defendant by his hair; and (2) St. Onge\u2019s statement that he would not let go of the defendant \u2014 a statement made in response to an exchange in which St. Onge proposed to the defendant, \u201cIf you let go of me, I\u2019ll let go of you,\u201d and to which the defendant responded, \u201cYou first.\u201d According to the majority, this evidence was sufficient for the jury to have found that St. Onge \u201cwas not only attempting to stop the assault, but also . . . was attempting \u2018to hold the defendant... as if in custody.\u2019 \u201d In my view, this scenario constitutes far too slender a reed to permit a rational jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that this element of the offense was satisfied. The inference that, in refusing to let go of the defendant \u201cfirst,\u201d St. Onge was attempting to detain the defendant (who was then sitting on top of him) rather than merely attempting to end their physical encounter, is flatly contradicted by the officer\u2019s proposal, only a moment earlier, that he would \u201clet go of\u2019 the defendant \u2014 the very antithesis of detaining him \u2014 if the defendant would do the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">It appears that the defendant was convicted simply based upon the rationale that a person who assaults a police officer should know that the result of such conduct will be that the officer will place him under arrest. If that proposition were true, however, then virtually any assault of a police officer would, without more, constitute <em>both </em>the crime of assault and the crime of resisting arrest or detention. Such reasoning would effectively eliminate the \u201cseeking to effect an arrest or detention\u201d element from RSA 642:2. To avoid this result, I would hold that in order for a person who assaults a police officer to be guilty of the crime of resisting, in addition to the crime of assault, there must be some evidence that, in response to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>assault, the officer said or did something reflecting an effort to place the person in custody. For example, if St. Onge, during his struggle with the defendant, had stated, \u201cStop, you\u2019re under arrest,\u201d or any words to like effect, or taken any action indicating an intent to arrest or detain, and the defendant had not immediately disengaged, I would have no difficulty in finding the evidence sufficient to support a conviction for violating RSA 642:2. But here there is no such evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">Because there was insufficient evidence to satisfy the \u201cseeking to effect an arrest or detention\u201d element of RSA 642:2,1 believe that, although the defendant\u2019s assault convictions are proper, his conviction for resisting arrest or detention should be reversed. For this reason, I respectfully dissent in part from the majority\u2019s decision.</p>\n<judges id=\"b494-6\">CONBOY, J., joins the partial concurrence and partial dissent of LYNN, J.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
