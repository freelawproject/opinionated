Construction Company, Inc., Cormier &amp; Saurman, LLC, and Brian Soucy, and the intervenor, Gerald Gagnon Sr. (collectively, the petitioners), appeal an order of the Superior Court <em>(Nicolosi, </em>J.) dismissing their petition for declaratory judgment and writ of mandamus seeking the return of impact fees paid to'the respondent, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>the Town of Pelham (Town). In its order, the trial court ruled that it was within the Town\u2019s statutory authority to adopt an ordinance that allows current property owners to seek a refund of unencumbered impact fees. The trial court ruled that the petitioners had no standing to seek the return of the impact fees. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">The record establishes the following facts. In 1999, the Town adopted an impact fee ordinance pursuant to RSA 674:16 (2008) and RSA 674:21, V (2008) (amended 2012). The ordinance allowed the Town to assess fees on new development in order to pay for capital improvements necessitated by the development. The ordinance also provided that, if the Town had not spent or otherwise encumbered the impact fees within six years, \u201c[t]he current owners of property on which impact fees have been paid may apply for a full or partial refund of such fees, together with any accrued interest.\u201d Pelham, N.H., Impact Fee Ordinance \u00a7 1002.00(a) (1999), <em>superseded by </em>Pelham, N.H., Impact Fees for Public Facilities Ordinance \u00a7 K(l) (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">Subsequent to the enactment of the 1999 ordinance, the Town required certain residential real estate developers, including the petitioners, to pay impact fees to the Town. After paying the fees, the petitioners sold the properties to individual homeowners. The Town imposed these fees to partially fund the construction of a new fire station. The balance of the construction costs was to be borne by the Town. Between 2002 and 2010, the Town spent some of the impact fees paid by the developers, including the petitioners, on feasibility studies, architectural drawings, and construction estimates relating to the fire station. On several occasions between 2006 and 2010, the voters in the Town turned down proposals to appropriate the additional funds needed to construct the fire station. In March 2012, the voters approved a warrant article for the construction of the fire station.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">In March 2012, the petitioners filed an action in the superior court seeking a declaratory judgment and writ of mandamus. The petitioners sought the refund of impact fees that they had paid more than six years earlier. The petition sought a declaration that the Town\u2019s expenditure of the funds for pre-construction activity violated both the impact fee statute, RSA 674:21, V(e), and the Town ordinance. It further alleged that, because the Town had failed to lawfully use the impact fees within six years, the petitioners were entitled to a refund. A short time later, Gerald Gagnon, Sr. intervened in the matter, arguing that, as successor-in-interest to Woodview Development Corporation, he was entitled to a refund of impact fees that the corporation had paid prior to selling its properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">In its answer, the Town denied the petitioners\u2019 claim that using the impact fees for feasibility studies and to pay for architectural drawings and construction estimates was contrary to the impact fee statute and Town <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>ordinance. The Town also filed a motion to dismiss. The Town argued that, under the ordinance, only a current property owner is entitled to a refund of impact fees. Because the petitioners no longer own the properties which had been developed, the Town argued that the petitioners lacked standing to seek a refund of the impact fees. The petitioners objected to the motion to dismiss on the ground that the Town lacked the authority under RSA 674:21, V(e) to enact an ordinance directing refunds to be paid to the current property owners.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">The trial court agreed with the Town. It found that RSA 674:21, V(e) did not prevent municipalities from choosing to direct refunds to the current property owners. The court concluded that the ordinance was not ultra vires, reasoning that the term \u201crefund\u201d as used in RSA 674:21, V(e) did not require that the fees be returned to the entity that paid them. Accordingly, the trial court ruled that, under the ordinance, the petitioners did not have standing to seek a refund and granted the Town\u2019s motion to dismiss. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">\u201cGenerally, in ruling upon a motion to dismiss, the trial court is required to determine whether the allegations contained in the petitioners\u2019 pleadings are sufficient to state a basis upon which relief may be granted.\u201d <em>Avery v. N.H. Dep\u2019t of Educ., </em>162 N.H. 604, 606 (2011). \u201cTo make this determination, the court would normally accept all facts pled by the petitioners as true, construing them most favorably to the petitioners.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cWhen the motion to dismiss does not challenge the sufficiency of the petitioners\u2019 legal claim but, instead, raises certain defenses, the trial court must look beyond the petitioners\u2019 unsubstantiated allegations and determine, based on the facts, whether the petitioners have sufficiently demonstrated their right to claim relief.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation and brackets omitted). \u201cA jurisdictional challenge based upon lack of standing is such a defense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 607. \u201cSince the relevant facts are not in dispute, we review the trial court\u2019s determination on standing <em>de novo!\u2019 Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">On appeal, the petitioners argue that the trial court erred in interpreting \u201crefund\u201d as used in RSA 674:21, V(e) to allow payment of the unencumbered impact fees to the current property owners. The Town counters that the trial court correctly ruled that the Town ordinance falls within the parameters established by the legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">Deciding the issue before us requires that we interpret the impact fee statute. \u201cStatutory interpretation is a question of law that we review <em>de novo!\u2019 EnergyNorbh Natural Gas v. City of Concord, </em>164 N.H. 14, 16 (2012). \u201cWe are the final arbiter of the intent of the legislature as expressed in the words of a statute considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cIn interpreting a statute, we first look to the language of the statute itself, and, if possible, construe that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>language according to its plain and ordinary meaning.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cFurthermore, we interpret statutes in the context of the overall statutory scheme and not in isolation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cThis enables us to better discern the legislature\u2019s intent and to interpret statutory language in light of the policy or purpose sought to be advanced by the statutory scheme.\u201d <em>Petition of Eskeland, </em>166 N.H. 554, 558 (2014) (quotation omitted). \u201cWe interpret legislative intent from the statute as written and will not consider what the legislature might have said or add language that the legislature did not see fit to include.\u201d <em>Eaton v. Eaton, </em>165 N.H. 742, 745 (2013) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">When a municipality enacts an ordinance pursuant to a grant of authority by the legislature, \u201cthe municipality must exercise [its] power in conformance with the enabling legislation.\u201d <em>Cmty. Res. for Justice v. City of Manchester, </em>154 N.H. 748, 754 (2007) (quotation omitted) (addressing a municipality\u2019s zoning power under RSA 674:16, I). If a town enacts an ordinance \u201cfor considerations or purposes not embodied in an enabling act, it will be held invalid ... as an ultra vires enactment\u201d beyond the scope of the delegated authority. <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">The Town enacted the ordinance at issue pursuant to its authority to adopt innovative land use controls under RSA 674:16, II. Impact fees are among the types of innovative land use controls specifically identified in the enabling statute. <em>See </em>RSA 674:21,1(m) (2008). Impact fees are assessments imposed upon development \u201cin order to help meet the needs occasioned by [a] development for the construction or improvement of capital facilities,\u201d RSA 674:21, V, thereby enabling \u201ca municipality to shift the cost for capital improvements necessitated by a development to the developer and new residents.\u201d <em>Upton v. Town of Hopkinton, </em>157 N.H. 115, 119 (2008) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">The statutory provision at issue here states that a municipal impact fee ordinance:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-8\">shall establish reasonable times after which any portion of an impact fee which has not become encumbered or otherwise legally bound to be spent for the purpose for which it was collected shall be <em>refunded, </em>with any accrued interest. Whenever the calculation of an impact fee has been predicated upon some portion of capital improvement costs being borne by the municipality, a <em>refund </em>shall be made upon the failure of the legislative body to appropriate the municipality\u2019s share of the capital improvement costs within a reasonable time. The maximum time which shall be considered reasonable hereunder shall be 6 years.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b205-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>RSA 674:21, V(e) (emphases added). The term \u201crefund\u201d is not defined in the statute. <em>See generally </em>RSA eh. 674 (2008 &amp; Supp. 2013). Nor does RSA 674:21, V(e) explicitly address whether the unencumbered impact fees must be returned to the entity that paid them, or whether they may be paid to another entity.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">The petitioners argue that, in the absence of a stated recipient for unencumbered or unspent fees, \u201crefund\u201d must be given its plain meaning, which they suggest is \u201cto pay back or to reimburse.\u201d Consequently, they assert that the unencumbered fees must necessarily be paid to the original payor or its successor in interest. The Town counters that the statute, when read as a whole, compels the conclusion that the legislature chose not to limit payment of refunds to the original payor. Alternatively, the Town argues that, to the extent that the silence in the statute regarding who may receive a refund creates an ambiguity that allows us to look to the legislative history, that history supports a broad definition of \u201crefund.\u201d In contrast, the petitioners contend that the legislative history supports their interpretation of the term \u201crefund.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">When a term is not defined in the statute, we look to its common usage, using the dictionary for guidance. <em>See Caparco v. Town of Danville, </em>152 N.H. 722, 726 (2005). <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>defines \u201crefund\u201d as either \u201cto give or put back\u201d or \u201cto return (money) in restitution, repayment, or balancing of accounts.\u201d WEBSTER\u2019S THIRD New International Dictionary 1910 (unabridged ed. 2002). <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>provides that a \u201crefund\u201d is \u201c[t]he return of money to a person who overpaid, such as a taxpayer who overestimated tax liability or whose employer withheld too much tax from earnings.\u201d BLACK\u2019S LAW DICTIONARY 1472 (10th ed. 2014). Neither of these definitions explicitly states that the original payor is the only entity that is eligible to receive a \u201crefund.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\"> We construe the meaning of statutory language \u201cnot in isolation, but together with all associated sections,\u201d and consequently our interpretation of \u201crefund\u201d is informed by its use elsewhere in the statute. <em>Appeal of Thermo-Fisher Scientific, </em>160 N.H. 670, 672-73 (2010). The term \u201crefund\u201d is also used in connection with unused exactions in RSA 674:21, V(j). Exactions are fees charged to a developer for off-site improvements needed for the occupancy of a development. <em>See </em>RSA 674:21, V(j). Exaction fees exist and are regulated under state law; although they are levied by municipalities, there is no requirement that a municipality adopt an exaction fee ordinance in order to lawfully collect exactions. <em>See id. </em>In contrast, impact fees may be imposed only if a municipality has adopted an impact fee ordinance. <em>See Upton, </em>157 N.H. at 119.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number> Under RSA 674:21, V(j), when an exaction is predicated upon a municipality paying a portion of the improvement\u2019s cost, and the municipality fails to appropriate its share of the cost within six years, \u201ca refund of any collected exaction shall be made to the payor or payor\u2019s successor in interest.\u201d On appeal, neither side argues that \u201csuccessor in interest\u201d as used in the exaction statute means anything other than the developer\u2019s business successor. Assuming without deciding that this is the proper interpretation, we observe that the mandatory refund language in the exaction fee statute \u2014 directing that a refund <em>\u201cshall be made to the payor or payor\u2019s successor in interest\u201d </em>\u2014 is absent from the impact fee statute, RSA 674:21, V(e). The petitioners argue, in effect, that this refund language should be imported into the impact fee statute. This we decline to do. Such would \u201cadd language that the legislature did not see fit to include.\u201d <em>Eaton, </em>165 N.H. at 745 (quotation omitted). Moreover, if, as the petitioners argue, the term \u201crefund\u201d can only mean payment by the municipality to the payor or the payor\u2019s successor in interest, then the explicit directive in the exaction statute that refunds be made to the \u201cpayor or payor\u2019s successor in interest\u201d would be redundant and unnecessary. <em>See State v. Collyns, </em>166 N.H. 514, 518 (2014) (\u201cWe must give effect to all words in a statute, and presume that the legislature did not enact superfluous or redundant words.\u201d (quotation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">We note that the impact fee statute, RSA 674:21, V(e), was enacted in 1991, and that the exaction language in RSA 674:21, V(j) was enacted more than a decade later, in 2004. <em>See </em>Laws 1991, 283:2; Laws 2004, 199:3. The fact that the legislature used different language when it subsequently addressed exactions supports the conclusion that the legislature did not intend the two sections to have identical meanings. <em>See State Employees </em>Assoc. <em>of N.H. v. N.H. Din of Personnel, </em>158 N.H. 338, 345 (2009) (\u201c[W]here the legislature uses different language in related statutes, we assume that the legislature intended something different.\u201d (quotation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">We also observe that courts in other jurisdictions have held that a \u201crefunded\u201d fee can be paid to an entity other than the original payor. <em>See, e.g., Washington Urban League v. F.E.R.C., </em>886 F.2d 1381, 1386 (3d Cir. 1989) (\u201cThe fact that the party receiving the \u2018refund\u2019 never actually overpaid the amounts in the refunds to the refunding party should not preclude the use of the word \u2018refund\u2019 to describe the transaction.\u201d); <em>Texas Eastern Transmission Corp. v. Federal Power Com\u2019n, </em>414 F.2d 344, 348-49 (5th Cir. 1969) (declining to interpret, refund as requiring payment to \u201cthe one who is out of pocket\u201d because such an interpretation \u201cwould do violence to the statutory scheme\u201d); <em>Southern County Mut. Ins. v. Surety Bank, </em>270 S.W.3d 684, 688-89 (Tex. App. 2008) (allowing insurance premium refunds to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>go to a non-payor); <em>Lake Cty. Bd. of Rev. v. Prop. Tax App. Bd., </em>519 N.E.2d 459, 461-62 (Ill. 1988) (construing \u201crefund\u201d to allow a county to offset its obligation to repay tax overpayment against payor\u2019s future tax obligations).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">The petitioners also argue that the trial court\u2019s interpretation of RSA 674:21, V(e) would lead to an inconsistent treatment of developers. The petitioners cite RSA 674:21, V(d), which allows a municipality and developer to agree upon a payment schedule for impact fees, and posit that there could be an agreement under which a developer is not obligated to pay the impact fee until the Town first pays its share of the capital expense. The petitioners argue that, under such circumstances, in the event that the Town fails to pay its share within six years, the developer would be relieved of its obligation to pay the impact fee, and it would retain money that otherwise would have been paid. The petitioners contrast that situation with one in which a developer has paid the fees upfront, observing that, if a refund becomes due under the Town\u2019s ordinance after the developer has sold its properties, the Town would refund the fees to the current property owners. The petitioners argue that, in the first scenario, the fees would have been \u201crefunded\u201d to the developer \u2014 the original payor. Notwithstanding this hypothetical inequity, however, we are not persuaded that a different result is warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">We will briefly address the petitioners\u2019 remaining arguments. The petitioners argue that the legislative history supports their interpretation of \u201crefund.\u201d However, because we do not find the term \u201crefund\u201d ambiguous when read in the context of the entire statute, we do not consider the legislative history. <em>See Clare v. Town of Hudson, </em>160 N.H. 378, 384-85 (2010) (\u201cUnless we find the statutory language to be ambiguous, we will not examine legislative history.\u201d (quotation omitted)). Finally, to the extent that the petitioners argue on appeal that the trial court\u2019s interpretation of RSA 674:21, V(e) effects a taking of their property without just compensation, we observe that the petitioners did not challenge the constitutionality of the statute in the trial court. Moreover, in its order, the trial court did not address the constitutionality of either the Town\u2019s ordinance or RSA 674:21, V(e), nor did the petitioners raise the issue in their motion for reconsideration. Accordingly, we find that this argument was not adequately preserved for our review, and we decline to address it. <em>See Dukette v. Brazas, </em>166 N.H. 252,255 (2014) (declining to address issue on appeal when the record did not support the party\u2019s assertion that it was raised before the trial court).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we agree with the trial court\u2019s interpretation of \u201crefund\u201d as it is used in RSA 674:21, V(e), and conclude that the Town was within its authority to enact an ordinance directing that any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>refund of impact fees be paid to the current property owner. <em>See </em>RSA 674:16; :21, V. Because there is no dispute that the petitioners no longer own any of the properties for which they paid the impact fees at issue, we conclude that the petitioners have no standing to seek a refund of the unencumbered fees. Accordingly, the trial court did not err when it dismissed the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b208-5\">DALIANIS, C.J., and HICKS, CONBOY, and LYNN, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
