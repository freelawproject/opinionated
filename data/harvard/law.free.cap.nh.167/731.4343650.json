The City filed suit against the respondents, James Cleaveland, Garrett Ean, Kate Ager, Ian Bernard a/k/a Ian Freeman, Graham Colson, and Pete Eyre, because they followed closely behind the City\u2019s parking enforcement officers (PE Os) on their daily patrols through downtown Keene, videotaping them, criticizing their work, and putting money into expired parking meters before a parking ticket was issued. After an evidentiary hearing, the trial court dismissed the action, ruling that the City\u2019s claims were barred by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. U.S. CONST, amend. I. The trial court also denied the City\u2019s petition for preliminary and permanent injunctive relief. We affirm in part, vacate in part, and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-13\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b753-14\">The following facts are drawn from the City\u2019s pleadings, or were adduced at the evidentiary hearing. The City employs PE Os to enforce motor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>vehicle parking laws and regulations in Keene. The PEOs patrol downtown Keene on foot and in marked vehicles, monitoring parking meters and issuing parking tickets. In December 2012, the respondents began protesting parking enforcement in Keene. On an almost daily basis, the respondents followed closely behind the PEOs, identifying expired parking meters and filling the meter before a PEO could issue a ticket, a process referred to by the respondents as a \u201csave.\u201d When the respondents \u201csave\u201d a vehicle, they leave a card on the vehicle\u2019s windshield that reads: \u2018Tom-meter expired! However, we saved you from the king\u2019s tariff!\u201d The respondents also: videotaped the PEOs from a close proximity; called the PEOs names such as \u201cf*****g thief,\u201d \u201ccoward,\u201d \u201cracist,\u201d and \u201cb***h\u201d; criticized the PEOs for issuing tickets; encouraged the PEOs to quit their jobs; and waited for the PEOs during their breaks, including waiting outside restrooms. The respondents testified that they engage in these activities to protest parking enforcement because they believe that parking is not a criminal act, and that parking tickets are a \u201cthreat against [the] people.\u201d The PEOs testified that they repeatedly asked the respondents to stop their activities, complained to the Keene police department, and reported the respondents\u2019 activities to the city attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">In 2013, the City petitioned for preliminary and permanent injunctive relief, alleging tortious interference with contractual relations and civil conspiracy to commit tortious interference.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The City asserted that the respondents, acting individually and in concert, tortiously interfered with the City\u2019s contractual relations with the PEOs by engaging in persistent and ongoing efforts to prevent them from performing their official duties, thus creating a hostile work environment for the PEOs. The City sought to enjoin the \u201cRespondents, or anyone under their direction, supervision, employment, or control\u201d from \u201ccoming within,\u201d \u201cvideo recording\u201d within, or \u201ccommunicating with any PEO\u201d within, \u201ca safety zone of fifty (50) feet of any PEO while that PEO is on duty performing his or her employment duties as required by the City of Keene.\u201d The City did not seek to prevent the respondents from filling meters. The petition contained the following statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-6\">[The City] does not seek an Order to prevent Respondents from exercising their constitutional rights to video record the PEOs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>from a comfortable remove or otherwise to express their opinion; rather, [the City] seeks only to prevent Respondents from taunting, interfering with, harassing, and intimidating the PE Os by establishing a safety zone between the PE Os and [the] Respondents while the PE Os are performing their duties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">The respondents filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that the City\u2019s petition failed to state a claim for tortious interference, and that the claim violated their right to free speech under the First Amendment of the Federal Constitution and Part I, Article 22 of the New Hampshire Constitution, as well as their right to government accountability under Part I, Article 8 of the New Hampshire Constitution. <em>See </em>U.S. CONST, amend. I; N.H. CONST, pt. I, arts. 8, 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">Shortly thereafter, the City filed a separate civil complaint against the respondents, requesting a jury trial and seeking money damages for injuries sustained by the City because of the respondents\u2019 tortious interference with contractual relations and negligence. These claims were based upon the same factual allegations as those set forth in the City\u2019s petition for injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">The trial court held a three-day evidentiary hearing and heard legal argument on both the City\u2019s petition for preliminary injunctive relief and the respondents\u2019 motion to dismiss. The PE Os testified that the close proximity of the respondents \u2014 sometimes only a foot away from them \u2014 caused the PE Os anxiety and made them feel harassed. One PEO testified that he was sometimes followed on his patrols by two or three of the respondents at the same time, and that they followed him so closely that if he turned around, they would bump into him. He ultimately resigned because \u201cthe constant harassment and intimidation [had] started to boil over into [his] personal life and [his] time off,\u201d and he felt he was \u201cbacked into a corner.\u201d Another PEO testified that she is \u201ctense and uptight all the time\u201d because of the \u201cawful anticipation\u201d of \u201cwaiting for [the respondents] to show up,\u201d and claimed that she is unable to do her job because she is \u201ctrying to avoid [the respondents].\u201d A third, who complained that the respondents waited outside her car and followed her in and out of city buildings on her breaks, testified that she does not feel safe when the respondents follow her at work. She also testified that, on one occasion, one of the respondents grabbed her wrist when she attempted to remove one of the respondents\u2019 cards from a car windshield. She has changed her work schedule to avoid the respondents, and has considered quitting her job. The City also offered testimony about the risk to public safety: specifically, that the respondents distract the PE Os as they drive on city streets, and that the respondents \u201cdart[ ] across\u201d the street, which the City asserted could result in pedestrian injuries or vehicle collisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>Several of the respondents testified as well. Cleaveland stated that an injunction requiring the respondents to stay away from the PEOs would be a \u201cconsiderable infringement\u201d on the respondents\u2019 ability to get their message to the public, and might create an antagonistic environment by requiring the respondents to raise their voices to be heard. The respondents also asserted that distances between five and fifteen feet away from the PEOs were \u201cideal\u201d for their activities, and that videotaping required closer proximity to the PEOs than filling meters.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">During the course of the hearing, the City narrowed its request for injunctive relief. First, rather than seeking the originally requested injunction that would bar the respondents \u201cfrom coming within\u201d 50 feet of any on-duty PEO, it modified its request, asking that the respondents be prohibited from engaging in \u201ctouching, taunting, obstructing, detaining, hindering, impeding, blocking, [and] intimidating or harassing\u201d conduct within a 30-foot \u201csafety zone\u201d around the PEOs. The City explained that it was not seeking to enjoin the respondents from merely \u201cbeing within the proximity of the officers\u201d; rather, it was seeking to prohibit the respondents from being \u201cin their proximity and engaging] in the behavior\u201d alleged. (Emphasis added.) Next, at the close of the hearing, the City again narrowed its requested relief, asking the trial court to order a \u201csafety zone\u201d around an on-duty PEO of 15 feet \u2014 approximately the distance between two parking meters \u2014 or \u201cany other reasonable injunction that the Court deems appropriate.\u201d The City emphasized that it did not seek to restrict the content of the respondents\u2019 speech, and acknowledged to the trial court that they had constitutionally protected rights to \u201cvideotape,\u201d \u201chave discourse,\u201d and \u201cget their message out\u201d as long as they did so from \u201ca reasonable distance back.\u201d <em>See Glik v. Cunniffe, </em>655 F.3d 78, 82 (1st Cir. 2011) (\u201cThe filming of government officials engaged in their duties in a public place ... fits comfortably within [First Amendment] principles.\u201d). The City sought to restrict only those aspects of the respondents\u2019 conduct that were interfering with the PEOs\u2019 ability to perform their jobs.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">The trial court granted the respondents\u2019 motion to dismiss. After expressing skepticism as to the viability of the City\u2019s tortious interference claim under these circumstances, the trial court concluded that it \u201cneed not reach this issue as the enforcement of [the tortious interference claim] is an infringement [up]on the Respondents\u2019 right to free speech and expression under the First Amendment of the Federal Constitution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b756-7\">Relying upon <em>Snyder v. Phelps, </em>562 U.S. 443, 451-58 (2011), the trial court analyzed the respondents\u2019 actions and concluded that their speech and expressive activities involved a matter of public concern and occurred in a traditional public forum \u2014 the streets and sidewalks of Keene \u2014 and, therefore, were \u201centitled to special protection\u201d under the First <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>Amendment. <em>Snyder, 562 </em>U.S. at 458 (quotation omitted). The trial court explained that the First Amendment protects \u201csharing common views,\u201d \u201cpeaceful pamphleteering,\u201d and the videotaping of government officials, and noted that \u201c[m]erely because many people disagree with the Respondents as to the role of parking enforcement in Keene does not subject their speech and expressive conduct to lesser protections.\u201d The trial court observed that, although the City could lawfully impose reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions on the respondents\u2019 activities, imposing liability for tortious interference would:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-5\">unreasonably prevent the Respondents! ] from exercising their right to free speech. . . . [W]hether a tortious interference claim exists depends on whether a jury finds the Respondents\u2019 conduct \u201cimproper.\u201d Such a subjective standard creates an unreasonable risk that the jury will find liability on the basis of the jurors\u2019 tastes or views, or perhaps on the basis of their dislike of a particular expression.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">(Quotations and citations omitted.) The court also denied the City\u2019s request for injunctive relief, reasoning that neither a temporary nor permanent injunction was warranted \u201cfg]iven the dismissal of the tortious interference claim.\u201d This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b757-8\">The City first argues that the trial court erred when it dismissed the City\u2019s tortious interference, civil conspiracy, and negligence claims. Although the City acknowledges on appeal that the content of the respondents\u2019 speech is constitutionally protected, and that the respondents have a constitutionally protected right to videotape the PEOs, it argues that the respondents\u2019 actions \u2014 \u201cfollowing closely, chasing, running after, approaching quickly from behind, lurking outside bathrooms, yelling loudly, and filming from close proximity\u201d \u2014 constitute \u201cimproper\u201d interference with the PEOs\u2019 employment duties. The City contends that this conduct is \u201csignificantly harassing behavior under the guise of political expression,\u201d and, therefore, not constitutionally protected. The City asserts, therefore, that a jury may impose tort liability without unconstitutionally burdening the respondents\u2019 right to free speech. The respondents counter that the trial court correctly ruled that it would violate the First Amendment to allow the City\u2019s civil claims to proceed to a jury. These arguments present a question of constitutional law; therefore, we review the trial court\u2019s analysis <em>de novo. State v. Bailey, </em>166 N.H. 537, 540 (2014). Although we normally address constitutional questions first under the State Constitution and rely on federal law only to aid in our analysis, <em>see State v. Ball, </em>124 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>N.H. 226,231-33 (1983), because the trial court ruled that the respondents\u2019 activities were protected under the Federal Constitution and did not address the respondents\u2019 arguments under the State Constitution, we first address the parties\u2019 arguments under the Federal Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">To establish liability for tortious interference with contractual relations, a plaintiff must show that: \u201c(1) the plaintiff had an economic relationship with a third party; (2) the defendant knew of this relationship; (3) the defendant intentionally and improperly interfered with this relationship; and (4) the plaintiff was damaged by such interference.\u201d <em>Hughes v. N.H. Din of Aeronautics, </em>152 N.H. 30, 40-41 (2005) (emphases omitted). Whether the alleged conduct is \u201cimproper\u201d requires an \u201cinquiry into the mental and moral character of the defendant\u2019s conduct.\u201d <em>Brownsville Golden Age Nursing Home, Inc. v. Wells, </em>839 F.2d 155, 159 (3d Cir. 1988) (quotation omitted). \u201cAction is not improper when the interference in contractual relations fosters a social interest of greater public import than is the social interest invaded.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted); <em>see </em>Restatement (SECOND) OF Torts \u00a7 766 cmt. c at 10 (1965) (\u201cThe issue is whether in the given circumstances [the defendant\u2019s] interest and the social interest in allowing the freedom claimed by him are sufficient to outweigh the harm that his conduct is designed to produce.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">Initially, we note that we share the trial court\u2019s skepticism as to whether a tortious interference claim can exist when private citizens engage in protest of the government. However, we need not decide whether a viable tortious interference claim can exist under the circumstances present in this case because we agree with the trial court that holding the respondents liable for tortious interference based upon their alleged activities would infringe upon the respondents\u2019 right to free speech under the First Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-7\">\u201cThe Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment \u2014 \u2018Congress shall make no law... abridging the freedom of speech\u2019 \u2014 can serve as a defense in state tort suits ...\u201d <em>Snyder, </em>562 U.S. at 451. \u201c[S]peech constituting a state-law tort is not necessarily unprotected speech,\u201d and, as the United States Supreme Court has made clear, \u201cstates may not regulate speech merely because the speech is defined as a state-law tort.\u201d <em>Coplin v. Fairfield Public Access Television, </em>111 F.3d 1395, 1401 n.2 (8th Cir. 1997). That is why the First Amendment bars certain state tort claims. <em>See Snyder, </em>562 U.S. at 460 (holding that First Amendment bars claims of intentional infliction of emotional distress, intrusion upon seclusion, and civil conspiracy against non-violent funeral protestors).</p>\n<p id=\"b759-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>Whether speech is constitutionally protected requires an analysis of whether the \u201cspeech is of public or private concern, as determined by all the circumstances of the case,\u201d including whether the challenged activities take place in a traditional public forum. <em>Id. </em>at 451. \u201cSpeech deals with matters of public concern when it can be fairly considered as relating to any matter of political, social, or other concern to the community . . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 453. Speech on matters of public concern \u201cis at the heart of the First Amendment\u2019s protection.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 451-52 (quotation omitted). \u201cThat is because speech concerning public affairs is more than self-expression; it is the essence of self-government.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 452 \u201cDeciding whether speech is of public or private concern requires us to examine the content, form, and context of that speech, as revealed by the whole record.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 453 (quotations omitted). \u201cIn considering content, form, and context, no factor is dispositive, and it is necessary to evaluate all the circumstances of the speech, including what was said, where it was said, and how it was said.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 454.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">On appeal, the City does not challenge the trial court\u2019s conclusions that the <em>content </em>of the respondents\u2019 speech is protected by the First Amendment because it relates to a matter of public concern, and that the respondents\u2019 activities take place in a traditional public forum \u2014 the sidewalks and streets of Keene. As the trial court observed, the respondents\u2019 speech \u2014 criticizing the PE Os for enforcing parking regulations and questioning the City\u2019s authority to regulate parking \u2014 plainly relates to issues of public concern because it involves challenging \u201cthe political authority of the City.\u201d Although certain aspects of the respondents\u2019 speech \u2014 such as referring to the PE Os in a derogatory fashion \u2014 may \u201cfall short of refined social or political commentary, the issues they highlight... are matters of public import.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Indeed, the Supreme Court has concluded that the content of protected speech \u201ccannot be restricted simply because it is upsetting or arouses contempt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 458.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">The City nonetheless asserts that specific aspects of the respondents\u2019 conduct \u2014 \u201cfollowing closely, chasing, running after, approaching quickly from behind, lurking outside bathrooms, yelling loudly, and filming from close proximity\u201d \u2014 are not protected by the First Amendment. The City contends that this particular conduct \u2014 the lawfulness of which it continues to challenge, and which, for the purpose of clarity, we will refer to as the \u201cchallenged conduct\u201d \u2014 has a tortious impact on the PEOs, and it would not violate the First Amendment either for a jury to adjudicate the City\u2019s claims, or for the trial court to potentially subject the respondents to tort liability for the challenged conduct. The respondents counter that \u201c[e]ven those activities that did not involve speech [are] expressive conduct entitled to First Amendment protection,\u201d and, therefore, are insulated from tort <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>liability. They assert that, \u201cabsent acts of significant violence,\u201d the First Amendment protects their non-verbal acts from tort liability. We agree with the respondents.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">As the Supreme Court has observed, \u201cthe presence of activity protected by the First Amendment imposes restraints on the grounds that may give rise to damages liability.\u201d <em>NAACP v. Claiborne Hardware Co., </em>458 U.S. 886, 916-17 (1982). For instance, the First Amendment protects the right of individuals to engage in public protest for the purpose of influencing societal or governmental change, even if that protest activity causes economic harm. <em>See id. </em>at 916; <em>see also State of Mo. v. Nat. Organization for Women, </em>620 F.2d 1301, 1317 (8th Cir. 1980) (\u201c[T]he right to petition is of such importance that it is not an improper interference even when exercised by way of a boycott.\u201d). Further, \u201c[w]hile the State legitimately may impose damages for the consequences of violent conduct, it may not award compensation for the consequences of nonviolent, protected activity.\u201d <em>Claiborne Hardware Co., </em>458 U.S. at 918. The First Amendment is implicated because the mere threat of tort liability for engaging in protected activity may undermine \u201cthe free and robust debate of public issues,\u201d and \u201cpose the risk of a reaction of self-censorship on matters of public import.\u201d <em>Snyder, </em>562 U.S. at 452 (quotations omitted); <em>cf. Claiborne Hardware Co., </em>458 U.S. at 931-32 (\u201cThe rights of political association are fragile enough without adding the additional threat of destruction by lawsuit.\u201d (quotation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">In <em>Claiborne Hardware Co., </em>a group of merchants sought damages in tort for malicious interference with their businesses \u2014 a tort analogous to the tortious interference claim made in this case \u2014 after civil rights activists organized a boycott of their businesses. <em>Id. </em>at 889-91. The protesters engaged in a pattern of \u201cintimidation, threats, social ostracism, [and] vilification\u201d of potential black customers to discourage them from patronizing the boycotted establishments. <em>Id. </em>at 894. Some of the protesters committed violent acts. <em>Id. </em>at 916. The Supreme Court concluded that the \u201cuse of speeches, marches, and threats of social ostracism cannot provide the basis for a damages award.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 933; <em>see also Organization for a Better Austin v. Keefe, </em>402 U.S. 415, 419 (1971) (allowing organization to hand out leaflets about \u201cpractices [that] were offensive to them\u201d because \u201cso long as the means are peaceful, the communication need not meet standards of acceptability\u201d). The Court further held that although violent conduct \u201cis beyond the pale of constitutional protection,\u201d because violence did not \u201ccolor[ ] the entire collective effort,\u201d the protesters\u2019 non-violent activity was constitutionally protected and not subject to tort liability. <em>Claiborne Hardware Co., </em>458 U.S. at 933.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number> Here, the challenged conduct, like the respondents\u2019 protected speech, is intended to draw attention to the City\u2019s parking enforcement operations and to persuade the PE Os to leave their positions. There is no allegation that the challenged conduct involves violent conduct. <em>See id. </em>at 918. Moreover, conduct \u201cdoes not lose its protected character . . . simply because it may embarrass others or coerce them into action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 910. We hold, therefore, that the First Amendment shields the respondents from tort liability for the challenged conduct. <em>Id. </em>at 933. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court correctly determined that enforcing the City\u2019s tortious interference with contractual relations claim would violate the respondents\u2019 First Amendment rights. Given this conclusion, we need not reach the respondents\u2019 argument that the tortious interference claim is also barred by the State Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">Because we hold that the First Amendment bars the City from pursuing its claim for tortious interference with contractual relations, we also conclude that the First Amendment bars the City from pursuing its claim that the respondents are liable for conspiring to commit the very same tort. <em>See Snyder, </em>562 U.S. at 460.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">The City also argues that the trial court erred when it dismissed the City\u2019s negligence claim. However, the City has failed to develop this argument sufficiently for our review. <em>See Auger v. Town of Strafford, </em>156 N.H. 64, 68 (2007). Therefore, we affirm the trial court\u2019s dismissal of the City\u2019s claims of tortious interference with contractual relations, civil conspiracy, and negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b761-8\">The City next argues that the trial court erred when it denied the City\u2019s request for preliminary and permanent injunctive relief. The City contends that the trial court erred when it failed to balance the City\u2019s \u201csignificant governmental interests\u201d \u2014 preserving public safety and providing a safe workplace for its employees \u2014 against the respondents\u2019 right to free speech before it ruled on the City\u2019s request for injunctive relief. The City further asserts that \u201c[tjhese interests provide permissible grounds to grant an injunction,\u201d and, therefore, notwithstanding the trial court\u2019s dismissal of the tortious interference claim, the trial court should have issued an injunction because of the impact of the challenged conduct upon the City\u2019s interests in preserving public safety and protecting the PE Os. The respondents counter that the trial court properly denied an injunction \u201c[g]iven the dismissal of the tortious interference claim,\u201d and that injunctive relief is not warranted because the City has not pleaded that the challenged conduct violates a city ordinance or any civil or criminal law. The respondents further contend that the requested injunctive relief would violate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>their First Amendment rights. The City responds that a municipal ordinance would \u201crun a greater risk of chilling First Amendment rights than a narrowly tailored injunction targeting specific misconduct by specific individuals.\u201d The question before us, therefore, is whether the trial court erred when, solely because it had dismissed the underlying tortious interference claim, it denied the City\u2019s request for injunctive relief without considering the particular circumstances of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">As a threshold matter, we address the respondents\u2019 argument that the issue of whether the trial court erred when it denied the City\u2019s request for injunctive relief was \u201cnot stated as a question presented in [the City\u2019s] notice of appeal, and is accordingly improper pursuant to Rule 16[(3)](b) of this Court.\u201d <em>See </em>Sup. Ct. R. 16(3)(b). Supreme Court Rule 16(3)(b) provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-6\">While the statement of a question [in a brief] need not be worded exactly as it was in the appeal document, the question presented shall be the same as the question previously set forth in the appeal document. The statement of a question presented will be deemed to include every subsidiary question fairly comprised therein.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b762-7\"><em>Id. </em>The City\u2019s notice of appeal presented the question of \u201cwhether the [trial] court erred in failing to balance the public employees\u2019 right to work without substantial interference, harassment, and intimidation against the private parties\u2019 right[ ] to protest governmental operations[.]\u201d We conclude that the question presented by the City in its notice of appeal fairly encompasses the injunction issue before us. <em>See Axenics, Inc. v. Turner Constr. Co., </em>164 N.H. 659, 668 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-8\">\u201cIt is within the trial court\u2019s sound discretion to grant an injunction after consideration of the facts and established principles of equity.\u201d <em>Town of Atkinson v. Malborn Realty Trust, </em>164 N.H. 62, 66 (2012). The decision to grant equitable relief \u201cnecessarily depends upon the factual circumstances in each case.\u201d <em>Exeter Realty Co. v. Buck, </em>104 N.H. 199, 200 (1962). \u201c[B]ecause the division line between equity and law is not precise... courts have considerable discretion in determining whether equity should intervene to aid litigants in the protection of their legal rights.\u201d <em>Sands v. Stevens, </em>121 N.H. 1008, 1011 (1981) (quotation omitted). We will uphold the decision of the trial court with regard to the issuance of an injunction absent an error of law, an unsustainable exercise of discretion, or clearly erroneous findings of fact. <em>Town of Atkinson, </em>164 N.H. at 66.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-9\">Here, the trial court did not consider the factual circumstances of the case prior to making its determination as to whether injunctive relief was warranted. Although the City expressly pleaded only two underlying claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>in its petition for injunctive relief \u2014 tortious interference with contractual relations and civil conspiracy \u2014 the City also specifically alleged that: (1) the PEOs \u201cfelt intimidated and harassed and have been unable to perform their job duties\u201d; (2) the respondents act \u201cwith the purpose and intention of preventing the PEOs from doing their jobs\u201d; (3) the respondents \u201cfrequently follow and surround individual PEOs in groups of one, two, or more, an inherently intimidating act;\u201d (4) the respondents \u201cplace the PEOs and the public in danger, both by their distracting behavior and also as a result of their disregard for rules of the road\u201d; and (5) the challenged conduct \u201cagitates the public, often creating hostile exchanges between members of the public and [the] Respondents that place the PEOs, the public, and the Respondents in danger,\u201d resulting, on one occasion, in a \u201cphysical altercation between Respondent Cleaveland and a member of the public.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">The City has consistently argued that, even if the tortious interference claim is dismissed, it is entitled to equitable relief based upon its \u201csignificant governmental interests\u201d in \u201cproviding a safe workplace for its employees\u201d and \u201cpreserving public safety and order.\u201d The trial court disagreed, and denied the City\u2019s request for injunctive relief \u201c[g]iven the dismissal of the tortious interference claim.\u201d We hold that the trial court erred when, solely because it had dismissed the underlying tortious interference claim, it denied injunctive relief without considering all the factual circumstances of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\"> Although the City\u2019s petition could perhaps have been drafted with more precision, New Hampshire is a notice pleading jurisdiction, and, \u201c[a]s such, we take a liberal approach to the technical requirements of pleadings.\u201d <em>Porter v. City of Manchester, </em>151 N.H. 30, 43 (2004) (quotation omitted). That the City did not set forth its factual allegations and legal theories as a separate count seeking injunctive relief is not fatal to its request; nor does it constrain the trial court in undertaking an inquiry as to whether the specific circumstances of the case warrant equitable relief. <em>See </em>27A AM. JUR. 2d <em>Equity </em>\u00a7 2 (2008) (stating that court sitting in equity is \u201cless hampered by technical difficulties\u201d and \u201cis not shackled by rigid rules of procedure\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b763-7\">In light of the City\u2019s allegations that the challenged conduct threatens the safety of the PEOs, pedestrians, and the motoring public, and given the testimony of the PEOs at the hearing, we hold that the trial court erred when it'failed to consider the particular factual circumstances of the case and whether an injunction should issue based upon the governmental and policy interests asserted by the City. <em>See Murray v. Lawson, </em>649 A.2d 1253, 1263 (N.J. 1994) (granting injunction \u201cpursuant to the court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>authority to grant equitable relief to enforce a valid public policy of [the] State\u201d); <em>cfi </em>RSA 642:1,1 (2007) (making it unlawful to use \u201cintimidation... or engage[ ] in any other unlawful conduct with a purpose to hinder or interfere with a public servant\u201d). Accordingly, we vacate the trial court\u2019s denial of the City\u2019s request for injunctive relief, and remand for the trial court to address the issue of whether the governmental interests and factual circumstances asserted by the City in its petition are sufficient to warrant properly tailored injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">\u201cEven protected speech is not equally permissible in all places and at all times.\u201d <em>Snyder, </em>562 U.S. at 456 (quotation and brackets omitted). The respondents\u2019 choice of where and when to engage in the challenged conduct \u201cis not beyond the Government\u2019s regulatory reach \u2014 it is subject to reasonable time, place, or manner restrictions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted); <em>see Bailey, </em>166 N.H. at 542 (observing that \u201c[f]ederal precedent employs the same standard [as we employ under our constitution] to assess the constitutionality of restrictions on the time, place, and manner of expressive activities taking place in a public forum.\u201d (quotation omitted)). We note that content-neutral injunctions that restrict speech or expressive activities must \u201cburden no more speech than necessary to serve a significant government interest\u201d to survive a First Amendment challenge. <em>Madsen v. Women\u2019s Health Center, Inc., </em>512 U.S. 753, 765 (1994). We express no opinion as to whether the City\u2019s allegations, if proven, are sufficient to warrant the trial court\u2019s exercise of its equitable power, or as to whether the particular injunctive relief requested by the City would violate the Federal or State Constitutions. Those are issues for the trial court to address in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">\n<em>Affirmed in part; vacated in part; and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b764-8\">DALIANIS, C.J., and HlCKS, Conboy, and LYNN, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b754-7\"> The City\u2019s original petition for injunctive relief, filed in May 2013, alleged only tortious interference with contractual relations. In July 2013, the City filed a motion to amend its petition to add a claim of civil conspiracy. It appears that the trial court had not ruled on the City\u2019s motion to amend at the time of the evidentiary hearing. However, because the trial court order identifies civil conspiracy as one of the claims filed against the respondents, we construe the order as having implicitly granted the City\u2019s motion to amend and briefly address this claim in this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
