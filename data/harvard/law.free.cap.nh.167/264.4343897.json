On appeal, she argues that the Superior Court (Colbwrn, J.) erred by: (1) failing to dismiss the criminal solicitation indictment; (2) declining to give the jury two of her requested instructions; and (3) denying her motion to dismiss the second witness tampering conviction on double jeopardy grounds. The defendant also argues that the evidence was insufficient to convict her of criminal solicitation and of one of the witness tampering charges. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">\n<em>I. Background Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">The jury could have found the following facts. The defendant owned a building at 139 Union Square, in an area known as the \u201cMilford Oval\u201d in Milford. Her mother\u2019s real estate business and a tobacco business owned by Richard Fells occupied the first floor of the building. The defendant and her boyfriend, Conrad Kelleher, lived on the second floor, and a tenant and her daughter lived on the third floor.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">In late 2012, the defendant and Kelleher discussed selling the building. Kelleher thought that doing so would help the defendant\u2019s financial situation, which he knew \u201cwasn\u2019t good.\u201d Shortly thereafter, the defendant informed Kelleher of her idea to address her situation: she proposed to collect $403,000 in insurance proceeds by having the building burned down. The defendant told Kelleher that because she did not want their belongings to be \u201cruined,\u201d they should move them out but then \u201cbring some old stuff in so it wouldn\u2019t look so obvious.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">The defendant and Kelleher spoke about involving the tenant in the plan. In mid-January 2013, the defendant approached the tenant, told her \u201c[t]hat she was broke,\u201d and said that \u201c[s]he wanted to torch the building to get the insurance money.\u201d The defendant offered to pay the tenant $7,000 to \u201cleave for two weeks.\u201d The defendant assured the tenant that if the tenant \u201cwanted to keep anythingt,] [the defendant] would store it at her mother\u2019s house.\u201d She also told the tenant \u201cthat she would help [her] find a place to live so [the tenant] wouldn\u2019t have to worry where [she] was going to live after that.\u201d The defendant informed the tenant that she was moving her own belongings \u201c[i]nto her mother\u2019s basement,\u201d and that \u201cshe didn\u2019t care\u201d about the businesses located in her building \u201cbecause they all had insurance.\u201d The defendant told the tenant that \u201cshe didn\u2019t want [her] to tell anybody.\u201d Later that evening, the tenant telephoned the defendant and \u201ctold her [she] didn\u2019t want any part of this scheme.\u201d The defendant told the tenant \u201cto get out.\u201d A few days later, the tenant spoke to Fells about the defendant\u2019s plan because she '\u201cwas afraid . .. [t]hat the building would be torched and he would lose everything.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>Eventually, Kelleher, Fells, and the tenant separately told the police about the defendant\u2019s plan. On January 17, Kelleher agreed that the police could record telephone calls between him and the defendant. In the first recorded call, Kelleher told the defendant that the police had requested that he come to the station to talk; Kelleher asked, \u201c[W]hat am I supposed to do?\u201d The defendant responded, \u201cWell, go down and . . . T don\u2019t know anything,\u2019 okay?\u201d She then said, \u201cI think it\u2019s got something to do with [the tenant]. . . . She threatened it. She threatened it, . . . okay . . . ?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">In the second call, initiated by the defendant, she told Kelleher to inform the police that the tenant was \u201con Klonopin\u201d and was often \u201cdrunk.\u201d She also told Kelleher to tell the police that he knew \u201cnothing\u201d and that whatever the tenant had told them was \u201ca lie.\u201d She told Kelleher to say that he \u201cdidn\u2019t hear nothing.\u201d At one point, she said, \u201cWhat did I just tell you to say?\u201d Kelleher responded, \u201cI\u2019m going to say that the woman is on . . . she takes that stuff and everything else and she drinks a lot.\u201d The defendant reminded Kelleher also to tell the police that whatever the tenant told them \u201cwas an absolute lie.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">In the third call, Kelleher told the defendant that the police had heard rumors about the building being burned down. The defendant asked, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you say like I told you, \u201cWell, the tenant threatened to burn it down. She\u2019s always drunk?\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">Shortly after the last call, the defendant called the police herself and left a voicemail message for one of the officers in which she said that the tenant was \u201cdrunk all the time,\u201d took \u201cKlonopin now, too,\u201d had a rent arrearage, and that she had threatened to burn down the building because the defendant had refused to allow the tenant\u2019s pregnant daughter to live with her. The defendant was arrested later that evening. In September 2013, the defendant sold the building for $150,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">\n<em>II. Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b288-9\">\n<em>A. Sufficiency of Criminal Solicitation Indictment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b288-10\">The defendant first argues that the criminal solicitation indictment violates Part I, Article 15 of the New Hampshire Constitution. The indictment alleges that the defendant solicited the crime of accomplice to insurance fraud when she purposely solicited the tenant \u201cto leave her apartment for a period of time in order for another person to commit. . . arson [on] the building ... so that [the defendant] could collect the insurance proceeds.\u201d The defendant contends that the indictment is constitutionally inadequate because it fails to allege: (1) the elements of the crime of insurance fraud, <em>see </em>RSA 638:20, II (2007); (2) the method by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>which the defendant sought to commit insurance fraud; and (3) the elements of the crime of accomplice to insurance fraud, <em>see </em>RSA 638:20, III. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">\u201cPart I, Article 15 of the State Constitution requires that an indictment describe the offense with sufficient specificity to ensure that the defendant can prepare for trial and avoid double jeopardy.\u201d. <em>State v. Ericson, </em>159 N.H. 379, 384 (2009). \u201cTo be constitutional, the indictment must contain the elements of the offense and enough facts to notify the defendant of the specific charges.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cAn indictment generally is sufficient if it recites the language of the relevant statute; it need not specify the means by which the crime was accomplished or other facts that are not essential to the elements of the crime.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">\u201cA person is guilty of criminal solicitation if, with a purpose that another engage in conduct constituting a crime, he commands, solicits or requests such other person to engage in such conduct.\u201d RSA 629:2. \u201cThe statute does not require that the solicited conduct actually occur.\u201d <em>State v. Kaplan, </em>128 N.H. 562, 563 (1986). Rather, \u201cthe offense of solicitation is complete once the request has been made.\u201d <em>People v. Woodard, </em>854 N.E.2d 674, 688 (Ill. App. Ct. 2006). The criminal solicitation statute requires the State only to identify the solicited crime. <em>See </em>RSA 629:2 (providing that \u201c[a] person is guilty of criminal solicitation\u201d if, \u201cwith a purpose that another engage in conduct constituting a crime,\u201d he or she \u201ccommands, solicits or requests\u201d that person \u201cto engage in such conduct\u201d). In this way, it is like the attempt statute. <em>See State v. Munoz, </em>157 N.H. 143, 147 (2008); <em>see also </em>RSA 629:1,1 (2007) (providing that \u201c[a] person is guilty of an attempt to commit a crime if, with a purpose that a crime be committed, he does or omits to do anything which, under the circumstances as he believes them to be, is an act or omission constituting a substantial step toward the commission of the crime\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">Also, like attempt, solicitation is an inchoate crime. <em>See </em>RSA 629:1 (2007), :2; <em>see also State v. Jensen, </em>195 P.3d 512, 517 (Wash. 2008) (explaining that \u201cthe crime of solicitation ... is the most inchoate of the ... anticipatory offenses\u201d). Solicitation \u201cis the act of trying to persuade another to commit a crime that the solicitor desires and intends to have committed.\u201d Robbins, <em>Double Inchoate Crimes, </em>26 HARV. J. ON Legis. 1,29 (1989). \u201cThe mens rea of solicitation is a specific intent to have someone commit a completed crime.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Solicitation is like conspiracy in that \u201cdisclosure of the criminal scheme to another party constitutes a part of the actus reus.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cBut, while the actus reus of a conspiracy is an agreement with another to commit a specific completed offense, the actus reus of a solicitation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>includes an attempt to persuade another to commit a specific offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 29-30. The crime of solicitation ordinarily implies the solicitant\u2019s rejection of the solicitor\u2019s request. <em>See id. </em>at 30. \u201cThus, solicitation can be viewed as an attempt to conspire.\u201d <em>Id.; see also Jensen, </em>195 P.3d at 517. However, unlike conspiracy and attempt, it requires no overt act other than the offer itself. <em>Jensen, </em>195 P.3d at 517.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">Contrary to the defendant\u2019s assertions, the criminal solicitation statute does not require the State to plead and prove the elements of the solicited crime, here, accomplice to insurance fraud. <em>See Munoz, </em>157 N.H. at 147 (referring to an indictment alleging attempt). Nor is the State required to plead and prove the elements of the crime to which the tenant would have been an accomplice. Because solicitation is an attempt to conspire, and because attempt \u201cis by definition a crime not completed,\u201d the State could not have pleaded, factually identified, and proved all of the elements of insurance fraud or of accomplice to insurance fraud because those crimes had not been carried out. <em>State v. Johnson, </em>144 N.H. 175,178 (1999). Requiring the State to prove the elements of insurance fraud or of accomplice to insurance fraud would force the State to prove more than is required by the criminal solicitation statute. <em>See Munoz, </em>157 N.H. at 147; <em>see also </em>RSA 629:2.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">The indictment in this case identified the crime solicited (accomplice to insurance fraud), the requisite <em>mens rea </em>(purposely), and the requisite <em>actus reus </em>(soliciting). Moreover, the indictment alleges that the defendant solicited the tenant to act as an accomplice to her insurance fraud by leaving her apartment so that \u201canother\u201d could burn down the building and the defendant \u201ccould collect the insurance proceeds.\u201d Because it contains the elements of the offense and enough facts to notify the defendant of the charge, we hold that it is constitutionally adequate. <em>See Ericson, </em>159 N.H. at 384.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">\n<em>B. Jury Instructions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">The defendant next asserts that the trial court erred by declining to give the jury her proposed instructions on criminal solicitation and entrapment. Whether a particular jury instruction is necessary, and the scope and wording of jury instructions, are within the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>State v. Furgal, </em>164 N.H. 430, 435 (2012). We review the trial court\u2019s decisions on these matters for an unsustainable exercise of discretion. <em>Id. </em>To show that the trial court\u2019s decision is not sustainable, the defendant must demonstrate that the court\u2019s ruling was clearly untenable or unreasonable to the prejudice of her case. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>When reviewing jury instructions, we evaluate allegations of error by interpreting the disputed instructions in their entirety, as a reasonable juror would have understood them, and in light of all the evidence in the case. <em>Id. </em>at 434. The trial court is not required to use the specific language requested by the defendant. <em>Id. </em>Rather, the purpose of the trial court\u2019s charge is to state and explain to the jury, in clear and intelligible language, the rules of law applicable to the case. <em>Id. </em>We determine whether the jury instructions adequately and accurately explain each element of the offense and reverse only if the instructions did not fairly cover the issues of law in the case. <em>Id. </em>at 434-35.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">\n<em>1. Criminal Solicitation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">The defendant\u2019s arguments regarding the criminal solicitation jury instruction stem from her mistaken belief that, to convict her of criminal solicitation, the jury had to find all of the elements of insurance fraud and accomplice to insurance fraud. For instance, she argues that the trial court did not \u201cbreak out\u201d the \u201crequired elements\u201d of the crime of insurance fraud. Similarly, she asserts that the trial court failed to instruct the jury that, to convict the defendant, it had to establish that \u201c[the tenant] knew that there was an insurance policy,\u201d \u201cthat a false or misleading statement would have been prepared and submitted to an insurance company,\u201d and that she \u201cwould have assisted with that statement.\u201d However, as we have explained, to convict the defendant of criminal solicitation, the State was not required to prove the elements of insurance fraud or accomplice to insurance fraud. Accordingly, the defendant\u2019s arguments fail to demonstrate that the trial court\u2019s criminal solicitation instruction constituted an unsustainable exercise of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">\n<em>2. Entrapment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">The defendant next faults the trial court for failing to instruct the jury about her entrapment defense to the witness tampering charges. For a defendant to be entitled to an instruction on a specific defense, there must be some evidence to support a rational finding in favor of that defense. <em>State v. Mendola, </em>160 N.H. 550, 555 (2010). \u201c \u2018Some evidence\u2019 means more than a minutia or scintilla of evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). \u201cTo be more than a scintilla, evidence cannot be vague, conjectural, or the mere suspicion about the existence of a fact, but must be of such quality as to induce conviction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 555-56 (quotation omitted). \u201cWhere there is simply no evidentiary basis to support the theory of the requested jury instruction, the party is not entitled to such an instruction, and the trial court may properly deny the party\u2019s request.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 556 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>Entrapment is an affirmative defense, upon which the defendant bears the burden of proof:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-5\">It is an affirmative defense that the actor committed the offense because he was induced or encouraged to do so by a law enforcement official or by a person acting in cooperation with a law enforcement official, for the purpose of obtaining evidence against him and when the methods used to obtain such evidence were such as to create a substantial risk that the offense would be committed by a person not otherwise disposed to commit it. However, conduct merely affording a person an opportunity to commit an offense does not constitute entrapment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">RSA 626:5 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">To be entitled to an instruction on this defense, a defendant must point to \u201csome evidence\u201d that: (1) law enforcement officials induced or encouraged the defendant to commit the offense; and (2) the defendant was not predisposed to engage in it. <em>Mendola, </em>160 N.H. at 556. Inducement is something more than \u201cmerely affording a person an opportunity to commit an offense.\u201d RSA 626:5; <em>see Mendola, </em>160 N.H. at 556. Rather, \u201c[a]n inducement consists of an \u2018opportunity\u2019 <em>plus </em>something else \u2014 typically, excessive pressure by the government upon the defendant or the government\u2019s taking advantage of an alternative, non-criminal type of motive.\u201d <em>Mendola, </em>160 N.H. at 556 (quotation omitted). \u201cAn inducement, by its very nature, contemplates more than a request and an affirmative response.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). \u201cIt is more than a solicitation. It is more even than a successful solicitation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">The defendant argues that she was entitled to an entrapment instruction because Kelleher, acting at the behest of the police, lied to her during the recorded calls. However, the defendant has made no showing that Kelleher\u2019s lies regarding his contact with the police induced her to commit witness tampering in which she was not otherwise predisposed to engage. Thus, the evidence, without more, does not constitute \u201csome evidence\u201d that would support a rational finding that the defendant was induced by law enforcement to commit witness tampering. <em>See id. </em>The defendant\u2019s failure to produce \u201csome evidence\u201d that she was induced to commit the charged offenses by law enforcement officials is fatal to her claim that she was entitled to a jury instruction on entrapment. <em>See id. </em>at 557. Accordingly, we need not address the sufficiency of the defendant\u2019s proof that she was not predisposed to commit the charged offenses. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>\n<em>C. Motion to Dismiss Second Witness Tampering Conviction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">The defendant next asserts that the trial court erred by denying her motion to dismiss the second witness tampering conviction on double jeopardy grounds. The first witness tampering charge alleged that the defendant, \u201cbelieving that an official investigation was pending or about to be instituted, . . . purposely attempted to induce or otherwise cause . . . Kelleher to <em>inform falsely </em>to the Milford Police Department\u201d when she told Kelleher \u201cwords to the effect of\u2019: \u201c \u2018Tell them you don\u2019t know anything,\u2019 \u201d and \u201c \u2018She threatened it, okay.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>See </em>RSA 641:5, 1(a). The second witness tampering charge alleged that the defendant \u201cbelieving that an official investigation was pending or about to be instituted, . . . purposely attempted to induce or otherwise cause ... Kelleher <em>to withhold information </em>to the Milford Police Department\u201d when she told him \u201cwords to the effect of\u2019: \u201c \u2018[T]ell them you don\u2019t know anything.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>See </em>RSA 641:5, 1(b). She contends that because both indictments alleged that she told Kelleher, \u201cTell them you don\u2019t know anything,\u201d the trial court violated her State constitutional guarantee against double jeopardy by imposing sentences for both charges. <em>See </em>N.H. CONST, pt. I, art. 16. The defendant does not advance an argument under the Federal Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">The State counters that each indictment concerned a separate telephone call between the defendant and Kelleher. The State argues that the first witness tampering charge concerned the first telephone call, and the second witness tampering charge concerned the second telephone call. The State also observes that each charge concerned a different statutory variant of witness tampering. The first charge alleged that the defendant induced Kelleher to \u201cinform falsely,\u201d <em>see </em>RSA 641:5, 1(a), while the second charge alleged that she induced Kelleher to \u201cwithhold information,\u201d <em>see </em>RSA 641:5, 1(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">The issue of double jeopardy presents a question of constitutional law, which we review <em>de novo. State v. Fischer, </em>165 N.H. 706, 715 (2013). Part I, Article 16 of the New Hampshire Constitution protects against \u201csuccessive prosecutions for the same offense after acquittal or after conviction, and against multiple punishments for the same offense.\u201d <em>State v. Glenn, </em>160 N.H. 480, 486 (2010) (quotation omitted). \u201cFor the purpose of double jeopardy analysis, two charged offenses cannot be regarded as the same offense if they do not arise out of the same act or transaction.\u201d <em>Fischer, </em>165 N.H. at 715 (quotation omitted); <em>see also Blockburger v. United States, </em>284 U.S. 299, 304 (1932); <em>cf. State v. Matey, </em>153 N.H. 263, 270-71 (2006) (deciding whether two offenses are the \u201csame\u201d for right to counsel purposes).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>Here, the defendant was charged with witness tampering during two separate telephone conversations. In one conversation, the subject of the first witness tampering charge, the defendant told Kelleher to tell the police that he did not \u201cknow anything\u201d and to tell them that the tenant \u201cthreatened it.\u201d In another conversation, which the defendant initiated, the subject of the second witness tampering charge, the defendant told Kelleher to tell the police that he knew \u201cnothing\u201d and that he \u201cdidn\u2019t hear nothing.\u201d The fact that, in each conversation, the defendant told Kelleher to tell the police that he did not know anything about the planned arson, does not establish that the defendant\u2019s conduct during separate telephone calls arose out of the same act or transaction. <em>See Fischer, 165 </em>N.H. at 715 (concluding that the fact that an assault in the living room and a later assault in the kitchen \u201cresulted in injuries to the victim\u2019s head and neck does not establish that they arose out of the same act or transaction\u201d). Because the charges arose out of separate transactions, we conclude that the defendant was not subjected to multiple punishments for the same offense and, consequently, that her right against double jeopardy under the State Constitution was not infringed. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">\n<em>D. Sufficiency of the Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">The defendant next contends that the evidence was insufficient to convict her of criminal solicitation and witness tampering. \u201cWhen considering a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence, we objectively review the record to determine whether <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>State v. Saunders, </em>164 N.H. 342, 351 (2012) (quotation omitted). We consider \u201call the evidence and all reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the State.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). \u201c[T]he defendant... bears the burden of demonstrating that the evidence was insufficient to prove guilt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">\n<em>1. Criminal Solicitation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">To convict the defendant of felony criminal solicitation, the State had to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that, with the purpose \u201cto collect insurance proceeds greater than $1500,\u201d she \u201csolicit[ed] another person to engage in conduct constituting the crime of insurance fraud,\u201d intending that the person act \u201cas an accomplice.\u201d <em>See </em>RSA 629:2 (defining crime of criminal solicitation); <em>see also </em>RSA 638:20, III (defining crime of accomplice to insurance fraud), IV(a) (providing that insurance fraud is a class A felony <em>\u201cif </em>the value of the fraudulent portion of the claim for payment... pursuant to an insurance policy is more than $1,500\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>The defendant argues that the evidence was insufficient to convict her of criminal solicitation in part because the State failed to prove the elements of the solicited crime, here accomplice to insurance fraud. As previously discussed, that was not the State\u2019s burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">The defendant also argues that there was no evidence to support a jury finding that her purpose was to collect insurance proceeds that exceeded $1,500. We disagree. An employee of the defendant\u2019s insurance company testified that, had the defendant\u2019s building burned \u201cdown to the ground with a total loss, . .. the claim could have been $403,000.\u201d Moreover, there was evidence that the tenant told others that the defendant\u2019s purpose was to collect $403,000 in insurance proceeds by having the building burned down. The tenant testified that the defendant told her \u201c[t]hat she was broke\u201d and that \u201c[s]he wanted to torch the building to get the insurance money.\u201d Viewing the evidence and all reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the State, we conclude that a rational juror could have found, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant acted with a purpose to collect insurance proceeds that exceeded $1,500.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">Finally, the defendant contends that the evidence was insufficient to convict her of criminal solicitation because, at trial, the tenant \u201chad serious trouble remembering\u201d certain facts and Kelleher\u2019s testimony was internally inconsistent. The tenant\u2019s memory difficulties and Kelleher\u2019s inconsistent testimony were factors for the jury to consider in assessing their credibility. <em>See State v. Hodgdon, </em>143 N.H. 399, 404 (1999). \u201cThe jury is free to accept or reject any portion of a witness\u2019s testimony and to resolve any conflicts in testimony.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cCredibility determinations are within the sole province of the jury and will be upheld on appeal unless no rational trier of fact could have reached the same conclusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, we cannot say that no rational juror could have found the tenant and Kelleher to be credible witnesses. Accordingly, this argument, like the defendant\u2019s other arguments regarding the sufficiency of the evidence of criminal solicitation, is unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">\n<em>2. Witness Tampering</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">To convict the defendant of the first witness tampering charge, the State had to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that, \u201cbelieving that an official investigation [was] pending or about to be instituted, she purposely attempted to induce or otherwise cause . . . Kelleher to inform to the Milford Police Department falsely\u201d by telling him \u201cwords to the effect of. . ., \u201c \u2018Tell them you don\u2019t know anything,\u2019 \u201d and . .. \u2018She threatened it, okay?\u2019 \u201d <em>See </em>RSA 641:5,1(a). The defendant argues that the evidence was insufficient to convict her of this charge because there is no evidence that she \u201cattempted to influence Kelleher... to say something that wasn\u2019t true.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>In so arguing, the defendant views the evidence in the light most favorable to <em>her. </em>However, we must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the <em>State. See Saunders, </em>164 N.H. at 851. When we do so, we conclude that a rational juror could have found, beyond a reasonable doubt, that when the defendant instructed Kelleher to tell the police that he knew nothing about her arson plan and that the tenant had threatened to burn down the building, she was purposely attempting to induce him to lie to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">To the extent that the defendant argues that the evidence was also insufficient to convict her of the second witness tampering charge, she has failed to develop this argument sufficiently for our review. All issues raised in the defendant\u2019s notice of appeal, which she did not brief, are deemed waived. <em>See In re Estate of King, </em>149 N.H. 226, 230 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b296-7\">DALIANIS, C.J., and CONBOY, LYNN, and BASSETT, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
