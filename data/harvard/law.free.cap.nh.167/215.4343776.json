We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">The following facts are undisputed. The petitioner is a New Hampshire resident who works as a self-described \u201cexport buyer\u2019s agent.\u201d As such, he purchases specific moifor vehicles from retail dealers across the country and exports them to buyers in foreign countries. Prior to exporting the vehicles, the petitioner obtains title to the vehicles in New Hampshire and holds himself out as the owner. The petitioner is then paid to transfer ownership of the vehicles to the foreign purchasers. The petitioner neither owns a retail motor vehicle sales location nor operates a lot to display vehicles, but performs his services as an export buyer\u2019s agent from his Moultonborough residence. The vehicles are never listed online or in any publications or classified advertising.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">In 2012, the petitioner purchased a 2012 Porsche Cayenne and a 2012 BMW X5 from out-of-state retail dealers for the purpose of selling them in China and Russia. When the petitioner applied for titles for the vehicles, however, the New Hampshire Bureau of Title and Anti-Theft denied the applications and the New Hampshire Department of Safety determined that he needed to obtain a state-issued motor vehicle dealer\u2019s license to export motor vehicles.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">The petitioner then filed the instant declaratory judgment action in superior court, seeking a ruling that he is not required to obtain a motor vehicle dealer\u2019s license.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Based upon an agreed statement of facts submitted by the parties, the trial court ruled that the petitioner is \u201cengaged in the motor vehicle business\u201d and, therefore, is required to obtain a dealer\u2019s license in accordance with RSA 261:103-a. The court subsequently denied the petitioner\u2019s motion for reconsideration, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>The petitioner asserts that: (1) he is not a retail vehicle dealer as defined in RSA 259:89-a because he purchased and exported the vehicles in exchange for a commission and never offered them for sale to the general public; (2) he does not offer vehicles for sale to the general public; and (3) if New Hampshire law requires a dealer\u2019s license for the purpose of exporting motor vehicles out of the country, it is preempted by federal law and violates both the Commerce Clause and the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution. The State responds that the petitioner\u2019s regular course of conduct of selling vehicles to foreign buyers qualifies him as a retail vehicle dealer pursuant to RSA 259:89-a. The State further argues that the petitioner\u2019s federal constitutional claims have not been properly preserved for review. We agree with the State on both points.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">We first address the preservation issues. In the trial court, the petitioner first raised the federal preemption issue in a motion to reconsider filed after the court issued its original order. Without any developed argument, the motion merely asserted that federal law preempts the state\u2019s licensing requirements and that requiring a license would violate the Commerce and Equal Protection Clauses of the Federal Constitution. The trial court found that \u201c[t]his argument was never pled, and was never made in the briefing on the merits, and is improper now,\u201d although the court then rejected the argument on its merits as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">In his notice of appeal, the petitioner raised preemption as an issue, but did not raise the asserted Commerce Clause or Equal Protection violations. Because the Commerce Clause and Equal Protection issues were not raised in the notice of appeal, we deem them waived and will not address them further. <em>Lassonde v. Stanton, </em>157 N.H. 582, 587 (2008) (\u201cAppellate questions not presented in a notice of appeal are generally considered waived by this court.\u201d). With respect to the preemption issue, the petitioner\u2019s brief on appeal is virtually identical to his trial court motion for reconsideration \u2014 other than noting that 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 192.2 does not require a federal license to export a used motor vehicle, it contains no developed argument or citation of authority explaining how or why applying this state\u2019s dealer licensing laws to his activities is preempted by federal law. This cursory assertion is insufficient to warrant appellate review, and we therefore.also decline to address the preemption issue. <em>See Douglas v. Douglas, </em>143 N.H. 419, 429 (1999) (\u2018We hold that in the realm of appellate review, a mere laundry list of complaints regarding adverse rulings by the trial court, without developed legal argument, is insufficient to warrant judicial review.\u201d (citation omitted)). Therefore, we will address only the statutory interpretation issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>The construction of RSA 259:89-a presents an issue of law, which we review <em>de novo. See State v. Addison, </em>160 N.H. 732, 754 (2010). We are the final arbiters of the legislature\u2019s intent as expressed in the words of the statute considered as a whole. <em>Id. </em>When interpreting statutes, we look to the plain language of the statute itself, and, if possible, construe that language according to its plain and ordinary meaning. <em>Id. </em>We interpret legislative intent from the statute as written and will neither consider what the legislature might have said nor add language it did not see fit to include. <em>Id. </em>Additionally, we interpret a statute in the context of the overall statutory scheme and not in isolation. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">RSA 259:89-a states as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-5\">\u201cRetail vehicle dealer\u201d shall mean a person engaged in the motor vehicle business who sells motor vehicles to the general public, or demonstrates for sale vehicles on consignment to the general public. Any person who sells or who acts as an agent of a seller for 5 or more vehicles at retail to the general public in a consecutive 12-month period is a retail vehicle dealer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">Thus, to meet the statutory definition of a retail vehicle dealer, a person must: (1) be engaged in the motor vehicle business; (2) sell vehicles or demonstrate for sale vehicles on consignment; and (3) make the sales or demonstrations to the general public.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">RSA 259:60-a (2014) defines a motor vehicle business as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-8\">\u201cMotor vehicle business\u201d shall mean a business which is principally engaged in one or more of the following activities: buying, selling, or exchanging motor vehicles requiring registration for use upon a way motor vehicle mechanical service, motor vehicle collision repair service, the reconditioning and restoration of motor vehicles, and the sale of motor vehicle parts. For the purposes of this definition, \u201cprincipally engaged\u201d means that the business derives at least 51 percent of its annual gross income from the motor vehicle business or, if there was no income in the prior year, 51 percent of the assets of the business are directly related to the motor vehicle business.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b238-9\">Here, the petitioner concedes that he \u201cgenerates income for himself by purchasing new automobiles from dealerships around the United States <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>and exporting the vehicles to buyers in foreign countries,\u201d and that he \u201ccan be seen as being engaged in the motor vehicle business.\u201d Additionally, he does not claim that his income derived from motor vehicle sales fails to meet the statute\u2019s \u201cprincipally engaged\u201d test. As a result, we conclude that the petitioner is engaged in the motor vehicle business.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">The next requirement of the retail vehicle dealer definition is the sale of vehicles or demonstration for sale of vehicles on consignment. RSA 259:89-a does not provide a definition of the term \u201csale.\u201d Accordingly, we look to its plain and ordinary meaning. <em>Addison, </em>160 N.H. at 754. A \u201csale\u201d is \u201c[t]he transfer of property or title for a price.\u201d BLACK\u2019S Law DICTIONARY 1454 (9th ed. 2009). This interpretation is consistent with how the legislature has defined the term elsewhere. For example, under the Uniform Commercial Code, as adopted in New Hampshire, a \u201c \u2018sale\u2019 consists in the passing of title from the seller to the buyer for a price.\u201d RSA 382-A:2-106 (2011); <em>cf. </em>RSA 259:95 (2014) (including \u201cany transfer of ownership\u201d within the definition of \u201csale\u201d for road toll fuel assessment purposes). This is precisely what occurs here. Prior to exporting a vehicle overseas, the petitioner obtains title to the vehicle and holds himself out as the owner. He is then paid in exchange for the transfer of the vehicle\u2019s title. The petitioner argues that he receives only a commission to export vehicles, and does not receive money for their sale; thus, he contends he is not engaged in the sale of the vehicles directly. Regardless of the term the petitioner uses to describe the payment he receives, however, there is no dispute that he had actual legal ownership of the vehicles he purchased and that he then transferred that ownership in exchange for money. Therefore, we conclude that the petitioner sells the vehicles.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">Finally, the petitioner argues that even if he is engaged in the motor vehicle business, he does not sell vehicles to the general public and, thus, cannot be considered a motor vehicle dealer under RSA 259:89-a. Because RSA 259:89-a does not provide a definition of the term \u201cgeneral public,\u201d we interpret the term according to its plain and ordinary meaning. <em>See Addison, </em>160 N.H. at 754. The petitioner cites the <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>definition of \u201cpublic\u201d in support of his argument that the phrase \u201cthe general public\u201d consists of a smaller, more specific subset of the public at large. The applicable <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>definition for \u201cpublic\u201d includes \u201c[t]he people of a nation or community as a whole.\u201d BLACK\u2019S LAW DICTIONARY 1348 (9th ed. 2009). The petitioner contends that the vehicles were exported to specific buyers obtained as clients before he purchased the vehicles and that, as a result, the vehicles were not offered for sale to the whole community. No evidence suggests, however, that the petitioner makes his services available to only a select few; nor does the petitioner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>argue that he sells vehicles to only a certain group of people. Even if the petitioner exports vehicles to buyers he obtains before purchasing the vehicles, there is no evidence to suggest that he limits the universe of persons who may become buyers. Additionally, the plain meaning of \u201cgeneral public\u201d does not require that every member of the larger community have access to the petitioner\u2019s services, that the vehicles must be targeted toward every member of the community, or that the community must be within the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">For the reasons stated above, we hold that the trial court did not err in determining that the petitioner is a \u201cRetail Vehicle Dealer\u201d as defined by RSA 259:89-a.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b240-6\">DALIANIS, C.J., and HICKS, CONBOY, and BASSETT, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b236-8\"> Prior to initiating this lawsuit, the petitioner filed a petition with the New Hampshire Department of Safety seeking a ruling that he was not required to obtain a dealer\u2019s license. Following a hearing, a department hearings officer determined that the petitioner was conducting business as an automobile dealer and, therefore, was required to obtain a motor vehicle dealer\u2019s license. The petitioner did not seek reconsideration of this decision, nor did he seek review of the decision in this court. Nonetheless, because the State does not contend that the unappealed administrative decision precluded the petitioner; from obtaining relief from the superior court, we have no occasion to address this issue. <em>See Kalil v. Town of Dummer Zoning Bd. of Adjustment, </em>159 N.H. 725, 728 (2010) (stating that res judicata is an affirmative defense that the trial court may deem to be waived if not asserted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b238-10\"> The second sentence of the statute appears to address the matter of how frequently or regularly a person must engage in sales of motor vehicles <em>(ie., </em>at least 5 sales in a 12-month period) in order to be regarded as a dealer. The petitioner does not claim to sell fewer than 5 vehicles in a 12-month period.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
