The employee exhausted the contractual grievance procedure. At each applicable step of the procedure, the employer denied the employee\u2019s grievance. Under the terms of the collective bargaining contract, the \"final\u201d decision on the merits of the employee\u2019s grievance was, effectively, recourse to a strike by his union. The union voted not to strike over his complaint. We are asked to decide whether the strike vote was the employee\u2019s sole and exclusive mode of legal redress, thereby precluding him from maintaining a breach-of-contract suit against the employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-8\">The Federal labor law on this question mandates that judicial review of a \"final\u201d decision on the merits of an aggrieved employee\u2019s complaint is barred unless the final step of the grievance procedure is inadequate to provide a procedurally fair decision. In this case, the \"final\u201d determination of the merits of the discharged employee\u2019s complaint was the strike vote by his fellow union members. The effect of this procedure is that the decision of whether an employee should be discharged from his employment is dependent on whether those adjudging the merits of his claim choose to imperil their own economic status; those desiring to rule in favor of the discharged employee would pay the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>price of giving up their own jobs. We believe such a \"final\u201d merits determination is contrary to the Federal labor law. We hold, therefore, that such a \"final\u201d decision on the merits of the employee\u2019s grievance does not bar the employee from maintaining a breach-of-contract suit against his former employer. We reverse the Court of Appeals and the trial court and remand to the trial court for consideration of the suit on its merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-4\">I \u2014 Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">Plaintiff-appellant Breish was discharged from his employment by defendant-appellee Ring Screw Works on June 1, 1971 for alleged theft of company property, a small can of cleaner valued at less than one dollar. Ring Screw Works discharged Breish for what it considered \"just cause\u201d, pursuant to the collective bargaining agreement in effect at that time between Ring Screw Works and UAW Local 771.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">That collective bargaining agreement included the following grievance procedure:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-7\">\"Article IV</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Add\">\"Grievance Procedure</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-8\">\"Section 1. Should a difference arise between the Company and the Union, or its members employed by the Company as to the meaning and application of the provisions of the agreement, an earnest effort will be made to settle it as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-9\">\"Step 1. Between the employee, his steward, and the foreman of his department. If a satisfactory settlement is not reached, then</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>\"Step 2. Between the Shop Committee, with or without the employee, and the Company management. If a satisfactory settlement is not reached, then</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-5\">\"Step 3. The Shop Committee and the Company may call in an outside representative to assist in settling the difficulty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-6\">\"Section 2. (a) Grievances alleging an unjust or discriminatory discharge must be submitted in writing to the foreman involved within two (2) working days of the discharge. The Company must render a final decision through the grievance procedure within four (4) working days of the receipt of such grievance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-7\">\"(b) Any employee who, as the result of such grievance is reinstated, shall be paid by the Company for the time which he would otherwise have worked for the Company and shall be returned to his regular job at his previous rate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-8\">\"Section 3. The Company shall not consider the grievance of any individual employee unless it is presented in writing under the grievance procedure within five (5) working days of their <em>[sic] </em>occurrence, excepting discharges which are governed by the preceding section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-9\">\"Section 4. Members of the Shop Committee and Chief Stewards shall be allowed the necessary time to adjust grievances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-10\">\"Section 5. An agreement reached between the Company and the Shop Committee under the grievance procedure shall be binding on all employees affected and cannot be changed by any individual.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b692-11\">In addition to the grievance procedure, the collective bargaining agreement included a provision which permitted the union to strike if and when \"all negotiations have failed through the grievance procedure set forth herein\u201d.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b693-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>Breish filed a grievance three days after he was discharged. Ring Screw Works accepted the grievance, which was subsequently processed through the grievance procedure <em>supra. </em>Ring Screw Works denied Breish\u2019s grievance at each applicable step of the grievance procedure. On September 19, 1971, Breish submitted his grievance to the local union membership for a strike vote. The union membership voted to not strike over Breish\u2019s grievance; the vote was 10 \"yes\u201d, 27 \"no\u201d. Breish appealed the result of the strike vote to the UAW Convention Appeals Committee, as was his right under UAW International procedures. The UAW Convention Appeals Committee unanimously upheld the local union\u2019s strike vote.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-4\">After Breish exhausted the applicable steps of the grievance procedure without resolution of his grievance (and before Breish took his grievance to the union membership for a strike vote) Breish sued Ring Screw Works and UAW Local 771 in Oakland Circuit Court on July 21, 1971. The defendant union had the action removed to the United States District Court (Eastern District of Michigan, Southern Division) on August 20, 1971. On Breish\u2019s motion, the \"separate and independent * <em>* </em>* claims * * * against Ring Screw Works\u201d were remanded to the Oakland County Circuit Court, August 22, 1972.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">On October 10, 1973 the Federal District Court, per Judge Kennedy, granted the union its motion for summary judgment. The court found, as a matter of law, that even viewing the facts in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>light most favorable to Breish, the union did not breach its duty of fair representation toward Breish as Breish had alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">After the Federal court decision, Ring Screw Works moved for summary judgment on the breach-of-contract suit before the Oakland County Circuit Court. On January 31, 1974, the court granted the motion for the reason that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-6\">\"The case of <em>Vaca v Sipes, </em>386 US 171 [87 S Ct 903; 17 L Ed 2d 842] (1967), clearly indicates that, in cases such as the one presently before this court, the employee bears the burden of establishing that he was unjustly discharged <em>and </em>that the Union breached its duty of fair representation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">Breish appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-8\">The Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court\u2019s holding but did so \"for different reasons\u201d. 59 Mich App 464, 466; 229 NW2d 806 (1975). The Court rejected the circuit court\u2019s conclusion that Breish was precluded from bringing his action because the union had not breached its duty of fair representation toward Breish.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Instead, the court perceived \"the primary question\u201d to be \"whether a union employee may resort to the courts where, having been discharged, the collective bargaining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>agreement provides no right to arbitration of the dispute\u201d. 59 Mich App 464, 468. The Court answered this \"primary question\u201d negatively, holding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-4\">\"The many Federal cases here cited * * * lead us to the conclusion that where the contract provides a method of resolving grievances in a final and binding manner, the fact that arbitration is not used as a method of resolving disputes does not allow the parties automatic access to the courts.\u201d 59 Mich App 464, 470.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">Breish applied for leave to appeal. This Court granted leave August 19, 1975.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">II \u2014 Context of Federal Labor Law</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">The issue in this case is narrow: we are asked to decide whether the strike vote of plaintiffs union, effectively the culminating step under the contractual grievance procedure, is plaintiffs sole and exclusive mode of legal redress, thus barring him from maintaining a breach-of-contract suit against defendant. .</p>\n<p id=\"b695-8\">Although this might appear to be a simple, routine case on the surface, its resolution brings into play a broad spectrum of complex Federal labor relations law.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> An essential reason for this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>legal complexity is that the contract grievance procedure at issue is quite uncommon in the context of labor relations law.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> According to one reputable estimate, 96 percent of the collective bargaining contracts in the United States include comprehensive contract grievance procedures culminating in final and binding arbitration;<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> most legal questions pertaining to the \"finality\u201d of a culminating step of a grievance procedure therefore revolve around the \"finality\u201d of arbitration decisions. Thus in the instant case we must interpret Federal law with respect to a relatively unique issue, an issue which, we note, has never been directly decided by the United States Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">Because of the legal complexities involved, we believe it necessary, as an initial measure, to briefly discuss and define the applicable context of Federal labor law in which the issue arises. In <em>Smith v Evening News Ass\u2019n, </em>371 US 195; 83 S Ct 267; 9 L Ed 2d 246 (1962), the United States Supreme Court declared that under \u00a7 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act individual employees have the right and standing to sue on collective bargaining contracts negotiated between their union and their employer.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Subsequent to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number><em>Smith, </em>the Court circumscribed this broadly stated right of employees to sue under \u00a7 301. Accordingly, in <em>Republic Steel Corp v Maddox, </em>379 US 650; 85 S Ct 614; 13 L Ed 2d 580 (1965), the Court determined that an individual employee is precluded from suing under \u00a7 301 unless he first attempts to exhaust the remedial procedure of the collective bargaining contract.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>However, under the <em>Maddox </em>rule, initially procedural in nature, certain consequences ensue with respect to the merits of the aggrieved employee\u2019s complaint once he has exhausted the contract grievance procedure to its final step. For example, if an employee exhausts a grievance procedure which has as its culminating step \"final and binding\u201d arbitration, the strong and established Federal labor law policy pronounced by the Court in the famous <em>Steelworkers </em>trilogy<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> comes into play. As the Supreme Court recently reiterated in <em>Hines v Anchor Motor Freight, Inc, </em>424 US 554; 96 S Ct 1048; 47 L Ed 2d 231 (1976):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>\"Collective-bargaining contracts, however, generally contain procedures for the settlement of disputes through mutual discussion and arbitration. These provisions are among those which are to be enforced under \u00a7 301. Furthermore, Congress has specified in \u00a7 203(d), 61 Stat 153, 29 USC 173(d), that '[f]inal adjustment by a method agreed upon by the parties is declared to be the desirable method for settlement of grievance disputes * * * \\ This congressional policy 'can be effectuated only if the means chosen by the parties for settlement of their differences under a collective-bargaining agreement is given full play.\u2019 <em>United Steel Workers v American Mfg Co, </em>363 US 564, 566 (1960). Courts are not to usurp those functions which collective-bargaining contracts have properly 'entrusted to the arbitration tribunal.\u2019 <em>Id, </em>at 569. They should not undertake to review the merits of arbitration awards but should defer to the tribunal chosen by the parties finally to settle their disputes. Otherwise 'plenary review by a court of the merits would make meaningless the provisions that the arbitrator\u2019s decision is final, for in reality it would almost never be final.\u2019 <em>United Steel Workers v Enterprise Wheel &amp; Car Corp, </em>363 US 593, 599 (1960).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">In addition, the Court, in <em>General Drivers, Warehousemen &amp; Helpers, Local Union No 89 v Riss &amp; Co, Inc, </em>372 US 517; 83 S Ct 789; 9 L Ed 2d 918 (1963). extended the ambit of the <em>Steelworkers </em>trilogy rationale to encompass the final and binding decision of a joint committee, holding such a decision enforceable under \u00a7 301 like an arbitration award. The effect of the <em>Steelworkers </em>trilogy and <em>Biss </em>is, therefore, that an individual employee is barred from maintaining a \u00a7 301 suit on the merits of his grievance after exhausting a grievanee procedure to the final step of a procedure culminating in either a \"final and binding\u201d arbitration decision or a \"final and binding\u201d joint committee decision. This is, essentially, what the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>Court has characterized as the \"finality rule\u201d. See <em>Hines v Anchor Motor Freight, Inc, </em>424 US 554.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">Ill \u2014 The \"Finality Rule\u201d Need Not Be Observed</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">When the Union Breaches Its Duty of Fair Representation or When The Final Step of the Grievance Procedure is Inadequate to Provide The Individual Employee a Procedurally Fair Decision on the Merits of His Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b700-7\">In the instant case, the Court of Appeals concluded that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-8\">\"[A]fter defendant had issued its final decision to discharge, plaintiff formally requested a strike vote of his union. The local union rejected plaintiffs request to carry the matter further by voting not to strike in support of his claim. It was at this point that the decision denying plaintiff relief became final.\u201d 59 Mich App 464, 470.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b700-9\">The effect of the Court of Appeals conclusion is that the \"settlement\u201d or \"resolution\u201d of the merits of plaintiffs unsettled grievance is the decision of his fellow union members not to strike over his grievance.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-10\">The direct issue before us is whether such a \"final\u201d decision comes within the protection of the \"finality rule\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"Arx3\">As we have noted, the United States Supreme Court has never directly addressed whether such means chosen for settlement of disputes would bar an employee from maintaining suit under \u00a7 301 after he has exhausted the contractual grievance procedure available to him. Therefore, in order to address this issue directly, it is necessary that we first answer a threshold question, namely, whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>an individual employee is barred from maintaining a \u00a7 301 suit after exhausting a grievance procedure to the final step of a procedure culminating in either the \"final\u201d decision of an arbitration or joint committee in <em>every </em>case. An answer to this question will provide us with the needed Federal labor law policy to adequately answer the question raised by the issue before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-4\">When we look at the Federal cases, we find that the Supreme Court has long recognized certain exceptions to the \"finality rule\u201d, thereby allowing individual employees recourse to court suit and judicial review of \"final\u201d arbitration or joint committee decisions. It is clear that the \"finality rule\u201d need not be observed when an employee proves that his union violated its duty of fairly representing his interests in the contractual proceedings. <em>Vaca v Sipes, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">In the recent Supreme Court case, <em>Hines v Anchor Motor Freight, Inc, supra, </em>the Court held that although a joint arbitration committee reached a \"final\u201d decision affirming the discharge of aggrieved employees, if there is sufficient evidence showing a union\u2019s breach of its duty of fair representation, the aggrieved employees may sue the union for breach of its duty of fair representation <em>and </em>the employer for breach of contract under \u00a7 301. The Court, recognizing that \"grievance processes cannot be expected to be error-free\u201d nonetheless concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-6\">\"But it is quite another matter to suggest that erroneous arbitration decisions must stand even though the employee\u2019s representation by the union has been dishonest, in bad faith or discriminatory; for in that event error and injustice of the grossest sort would multiply. The contractual system would then cease to qualify as an adequate mechanism to secure individual redress for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>damaging failure of the employer to abide by the contract.\u201d 424 US 571.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">The Court ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-6\">\"Congress has put its blessing on private dispute settlement arrangements, but it was anticipated, we are sure, that <em>the contractual machinery would operate within some minimum levels of integrity. \u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) 424 US 571.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">Such a \"minimum level of integrity\u201d would not be maintained, the Court concluded, if \"[wjrongfully discharged employees would be left without jobs and without a fair opportunity to secure an adequate remedy\u201d. 424 US 571.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-8\">The Court in <em>Hines </em>cited, with approval, two Third Circuit Court of Appeals cases, <em>Rothlein v Armour &amp; Co, Inc, </em>391 F2d 574 (CA3, 1968), and <em>Bieski v Eastern Automobile Forwarding Co, </em>396 F2d 32 (CA 3, 1968). 424 US 571, fn 11. In <em>Rothlein, </em>the question before the court was whether a \"final\u201d decision by a joint union-management committee regarding the jurisdiction of an employee\u2019s grievance under the contract was enforceable under the \"finality rule\u201d. Recognizing the strong potential for the \"coincidence of union and employer interests\u201d, the court stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-9\">\"In deciding whether the grievance procedure provides an acceptable 'merits\u2019 determination, in light of the possible unity of union and management interest, <em>the type of procedure afforded becomes relevant. \u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) 391 F2d 574, 580.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b703-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>In <em>Bieski, </em>confronted with essentially the same issue, the court reiterated and articulated the <em>Rothlein </em>rule further:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-4\">\"If the court is convinced both that the contract procedure was intended to cover the dispute and, in addition, <em>that the intended procedure was adequate to provide a fair and informed decision, </em>then review of the merits of any decision should be limited to cases of fraud, deceit, or instances of unions in breach of their duty of fair representation.\u201d (Emphasis added.) 396 F2d 32, 38.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">The clear, unequivocal conclusion to be drawn from the <em>Humphrey, Hines, Rothlein </em>and <em>Bieski </em>cases is this:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-6\">1) when a union has breached its duty of fair representation, an aggrieved employee may seek judicial review of the \"final\u201d decision on the merits of his claim reached at the culminating step of the contract procedure;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-7\">2) when the final step of the grievance procedure is inadequate to provide an aggrieved employee with a procedurally fair decision, the aggrieved employee may seek judicial review on the merits of his claim.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b704-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>IV \u2014 A \"Final\u201d Decision by a Strike Vote is Inadequate to Provide a Procedurally Fair Decision</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">We now address the issue before us. As we have stated, the effect of the Court of Appeals conclu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>sion in the instant case is that the \"settlement\u201d of the merits of plaintiffs grievance is the decision of his fellow union members not to strike over his grievance. Does such a \"final\u201d decision come within the protection of the \"finality rule\u201d? Our answer is no. As we have seen in our analysis of the <em>Hines, Rothlein </em>and <em>Bieski </em>cases, the Federal labor law mandates that when the final step of a grievance procedure is inadequate to provide an aggrieved employee with a procedurally fair decision, the aggrieved employee may seek judicial review on the merits of his claim. Adopting and applying this rule, we hold that a strike vote by plaintiffs fellow union members was inadequate to provide plaintiff the kind of procedurally fair decision to which he was entitled under the Federal labor law. We find the \"strike vote\u201d decision unsatisfactory for the essential reason that such a procedure placed those \"adjudging\u201d the substance of plaintiffs claim in a legally unacceptable conflict of interest position.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Even if we assume that plaintiffs fellow union members believed he was wrongfully discharged under the collective bargaining contract, some may have felt that it was not worth imperiling their own economic or employment status by going out on strike over his grievance. From another perspective, it is crucial to note that in such a procedure the union, as plaintiffs agent, played no active part in the decision-making process itself. In the instant case, the union did not breach its duty of fair representation toward plaintiff permitting the employee to take the matter to court. Thus, plaintiff, left without a court remedy, is left instead to the \"remedy\u201d of a procedure in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>which the decision of whether he was wrongfully discharged is \"adjudged\u201d by persons in a conflict of interest position. We believe that such a procedure was inadequate to provide plaintiff any kind of fair merits decision. In addition, we recall, with emphasis, what Justice Brennan, speaking for our unanimous Court, forcefully declared in <em>Lowe v Hotel &amp; Restaurant Employees Union, Local 705, </em>389 Mich 123; 205 NW2d 167 (1973):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-5\">\"Every man\u2019s employment is of utmost importance to him. It occupies his time, his talents, and his thoughts. It controls his economic destiny. It is the means by which he feeds his family and provides for their security. It bears upon his personal well-being, his mental and physical health.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-6\">\"In days gone by, a man\u2019s occupation literally gave him his name. Even today, continuous and secure employment contributes to a sense of identity for most people.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-7\">\"It is no solace to a man fired from his job that his union acted without spite, animosity, ill will, and hostility toward him. If he has been wrongfully discharged by his employer, in violation of his contract of employment, a collective bargaining agreement made for his benefit and protection, it is unthinkable that he should be denied relief \u2014 denied justice \u2014 by the courts.\u201d 389 Mich 123, 148.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b706-8\">To leave the determination of the merits of plaintiff\u2019s claim to a \"strike vote\u201d by his fellow union members not only denies plaintiff adequate legal relief, it also denies him the basic justice he is legally assured under the Federal labor law.

In <em>Republic Steel v Maddox, supra, </em>the Court pronounced that if the union did not refuse to press or \"perfunctorily\u201d press an individual\u2019s claim, a rule requiring that individual employees attempt to exhaust the contract grievance procedure would not substantially undermine the individual employees\u2019 rights because \"it cannot be said, in the normal situation, that contract grievance procedures are inadequate to protect the interests of an aggrieved employee until the employee has attempted to implement the procedures and found them so\u201d. 379 US 650, 653. The Court recognized that \"in the normal situation\u201d the contract grievance procedure is undoubtedly the best-suited remedy for an aggrieved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>employee; an essential purpose of contract grievance procedures is to provide a fair, stabilizing remedy which can effectively and adequately resolve individual claims arising out of the collective bargaining contract. But the Court also emphasized that if the contract procedures proved <em>inadequate </em>to \"protect the interests of the aggrieved employee\u201d, the individual employee must be allowed another form of redress, so that his interests remain protected. <em>See, </em>379 US 650, 652-653.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">This judicial awareness of safeguarding an individual employee\u2019s right to be fairly treated within contractual grievance procedure prior to his exhaustion of the procedure is also apparent in <em>Vaca v Sipes, supra. </em>In <em>Vaca, </em>the Court reiterated that the union has a statutory duty to fairly represent an individual employee\u2019s interests under the collective bargaining agreement. In fact, as we have noted <em>(see </em>fn 8, <em>supra), </em>if the union breaches this duty before an employee has exhausted the grievance procedure (a condition precedent to seeking court aid), an employee can bypass the contractual remedial procedure and seek redress in court against the union (for breach of its duty of fair representation toward the employee) and the employer (for breach of contract, in a \u00a7 301 suit).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-8\">Once a grievance procedure has been exhausted to its final step, the Court is still careful to protect the individual employee by assuring him a \"final\u201d decision on the merits of his claim which is procedurally fair. As we have seen, the Court, in the famous <em>Steelworkers </em>trilogy, sanctioned the \"final\u201d decision of an arbitrator as enforceable (under \u00a7 301) and, effectively, the aggrieved employee\u2019s \"final\u201d merits determination. Although the Court did not elaborate upon the procedural safeguards inherent in arbitration, it is clear from the language of the <em>Steelworkers </em>cases that one of the reasons the Court recognized the Federal labor law policy of deferring individual claims to arbitration procedures was the Court\u2019s intense awareness of the protective aspects of arbitration from the employee\u2019s standpoint. In <em>Steelworkers v Warrior &amp; Gulf, supra, </em>the Court perceived arbitration as \"the means of solving the unforeseeable by molding a system of private law for all the problems which may arise and to provide for their solution in a way which will generally accord with the variant needs and desires of the parties\u201d. 363 US 574, 581. According to the Court, \"[t]he ablest judge cannot be expected to bring the same experience and competence [as the arbitrator] to bear upon the determination of a grievance, because he cannot be similarly informed\u201d. 363 US 574, 582. As the Court pronounced in <em>Steelworkers v Enterprise Corp, supra, </em>the arbitrator, when interpreting and applying the collective bargaining contract, brings an \"informed judgment to bear in order to reach a fair solution of a problem\u201d. 363 US 593, 597.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b705-4\"> In <em>Rothlein, supra, </em>the \"possible unity of union and management interest\u201d 391 F2d 574, 580, in other words, a conflict of interest situation, was the essential basis for the court\u2019s holding that an otherwise \"final\u201d decision should be disregarded.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b707-5\"> In <em>Haynes, </em>the employee was discharged by his employer.

The Court, after discussing what it perceived as the applicable Federal labor law regarding the issue held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-9\">\u201cThe fact of the matter here is that the union processed appellant\u2019s grievance up to the point of striking.

The court has jurisdiction. <em>Smith v Evening News Association, supra. </em>The action under the grievance procedure, here a final decision under the terms of the agreement, may be asserted in bar as an affirmative defense. That is this case, and thus it must be affirmed.\u201d 362 F2d 414, 418.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b707-10\">We have no problem with the jurisdictional aspect of the Court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>holding. But, regarding the \"finality\u201d aspect, we find the Court\u2019s conclusion was based on somewhat cryptic legal reasoning. The Court first noted that the employee \"argues that the implication may be gained from some of the language * * * in <em>Maddox </em>that the employee may sue once he has exhausted his remedy under the grievance procedure of the collective bargaining agreement. There is some such language, but there is other language, equally compelling, to the contrary\u201d. 362 F2d 414, 417-418. However, we do not find any language in <em>Maddox </em>which supports the conclusion that an employee may not sue once he has exhausted his remedy under the contractual procedure. The court in <em>Maddox </em>did state that \"it cannot be said, in the normal situation, that contract grievance procedures are inadequate to protect interests of an aggrieved employee until the employee has attempted to implement the procedure and found them so\u201d. 379 US 650, 653. This statement implies that if the employee does, in fact, find the procedure \"inadequate\u201d after utilizing it, the employee might be allowed to sidestep the grievance procedure and sue under \u00a7 301. But regardless of whether such a conclusion can be drawn, the Court in <em>Maddox </em>did not intimate that the grievance procedure was the individual\u2019s exclusive mode of legal redress. <em>See, </em>Note, <em>Section 301(a) and the Employee: An Illusory Remedy, </em>35 Fordham L Rev 517, 527 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">After asserting that there was \u201ccompelling\u201d language in <em>Maddox </em>to support the proposition that a grievance procedure is an individual grievant\u2019s sole legal recourse, the <em>Haynes </em>court shifted its reliance to two Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals cases, <em>Hildreth v Union News Co, </em>315 F2d 548 (CA 6, 1963), <em>cert den, </em>375 US 826; 84 S Ct 69; 11 L Ed 2d 59 (1963), and <em>Simmons v Union News Co, </em>341 F2d 531 (CA 6, 1965), <em>cert den </em>382 US 884; 86 S Ct 165; 15 L Ed 2d 125 (1965). [The 1961 <em>Hildreth </em>opinion, <em>United News Co v Hildreth, </em>295 F2d 658 (CA 6, 1961), fully stated the case and the Sixth Circuit\u2019s conclusion of law. The 1963 opinion merely reaffirmed the first opinion\u2019s validity in light of <em>Smith v Evening News Ass\u2019n, supra. Simmons </em>also reaffirmed <em>Hildreth </em>in light of <em>Humphrey v Moore, supra.]</em></p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">In <em>Hildreth, </em>the plaintiff was an employee at a lunch counter which was losing profits, apparently from a mishandling of funds and goods. Defendant employer told the union that it wanted to discharge all the employees who worked at the counter. The union finally agreed to a temporary replacement of five employees, to become permanently discharged if improvement was shown regarding mishandled funds. Plaintiff, one of the five employees arbitrarily chosen, and, eventually, permanently discharged, had a perfect ten-year working record. Defendant never contended that the plaintiff mishandled merchandise or money. The Sixth Circuit held that the union had authority, as agent of the employee acting in the collective interest, to agree with the employer to temporarily discharge five employees merely on suspicion of theft, and to make the discharge permanent upon a showing of improvement in business operations.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">The court in <em>Haynes </em>merely noted, with regard to the substantive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>aspects of <em>Hildreth, </em>that \"the court determined that the claim of an employee was barred by her union\u2019s agreement with the employer that there was just cause for the discharge\u201d. Apparently the court relied upon this \"holding\u201d to support its conclusion that an individual employee is bound by the remedy chosen by his union, acting as his agent. But, importantly, <em>Hildreth </em>was decided prior to <em>Vaca v Sipes, </em>386 US 171; 87 S Ct 903; 17 L Ed 2d 842 (1967). In our opinion, it is highly questionable whether the union\u2019s actions in <em>Hildreth </em>withstand scrutiny under the <em>Vaca </em>rule, which states: \"A breach of the statutory duty of fair representation occurs only when a union\u2019s conduct toward a member of the collective bargaining unit is arbitrary, discriminatory, or in bad faith.\u201d 386 US 171, 190. Here, the union\u2019s agreement to discharge the employee \u2014 without any proof of wrongdoing \u2014 was clearly arbitrary. <em>See, </em>Comment, <em>Protection of Individual Rights in Collective Bargaining: The Need for a More De\u00f1nitive Standard of Fair Representation Within the </em>Vaca <em>Doctrine, </em>14 Vill L Rev 484, 492-493 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">After <em>Haynes, </em>the Fifth Circuit abandoned the <em>Maddox </em>and <em>Hildreth </em>cases as its rationale for the <em>Haynes </em>\"finality rule\u201d. In <em>Harris v Chemical Leaman Tank Lines, Inc, </em>437 F2d 167 (CA 5, 1971), a post<em>Vaca </em>case, the court charted the legal basis of its \"finality rule\u201d to \u00a7 203(d), as cited with approval in <em>Steelworkers v American Mfg Co, </em>363 US 564; 80 S Ct 1343; 4 L Ed 2d 1403 (1960). We therefore assume that this is presently the legal basis for the Fifth Circuit rule, not <em>Maddox </em>or <em>Hildreth.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
