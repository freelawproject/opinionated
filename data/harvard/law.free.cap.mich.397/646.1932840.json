We, therefore, reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals and reinstate the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-9\">There are three issues to be decided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-10\">1) Whether the guilty plea is fatally defective because the record fails to disclose the defendant\u2019s acknowledgment of guilt of the element of asportation of the kidnapping victims;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-11\">2) Whether the trial court, in failing to advise the defendant that kidnapping carried a maximum penalty of life imprisonment, failed to inform him of the \"consequences of his plea\u201d -and;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-12\">3) Whether, in the event the guilty plea is reinstated, the defendant is entitled to be resentenced because the trial court failed to consider a presentence investigative report pursuant to MCLA 771.14; MSA 28.1144.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b752-13\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b752-14\">On the morning of January 23, 1962 the defendant Mauch was arraigned in the Jackson County Circuit Court. As the transcript of that proceeding discloses, he was specifically advised by the court not once but twice, that he was charged with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>kidnapping and that he had a right to be tried by a jury on each of the charges. The arraignment record also discloses that the court advised that Officer Norman Richmond was one of the victims and the Prosecuting Attorney announced that Officer Frank Miller was the second victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-4\">Two days later, on January 25, 1962, Mauch withdrew his pleas of not guilty and pleaded guilty to the charges as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-5\"><em>\"Mr. Carroll [Defense Counsel]: </em>If the Court please, I have talked with these defendants. Each of them informs me that he wishes to withdraw the pleas of not guilty entered for them by order of the Court on their arraignments and to enter a plea of guilty in the cases People v William Winegar and John Rogers [a/k/a Richard Mauch].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-6\"><em>\"The Court: </em>Now, Mr. Mauck <em>[sic], </em>have any promises been made to you to get you to plead guilty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-7\"><em>\"Defendant Mauch: </em>No, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-8\"><em>\"The Court: </em>Have any threats been made against you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-9\"><em>\"Defendant: </em>No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-10\"><em>\"The Court: </em>Are you entering this plea freely and voluntarily?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-11\"><em>\"Defendant: </em>Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-12\"><em>\"The Court: </em>And did you on the 28th day of October, 1961, confine Frank Miller and Norman Richmond within this state against their will?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-13\"><em>\"Defendant: Yes, </em>your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-14\"><em>\"The Court: </em>Very well. The court will accept the plea of guilty of each of you, and I am aware of the fact that each of you is presently serving a life sentence which was imposed in an adjoining county; so I see no need to delay in passing sentence upon you. I may as well pass sentence this morning.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-15\">\"I am going to give each of you the same sentence in each case, and each of these sentences will run concurrently.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>\"It is the sentence of this court that you be confined in the State Prison of Southern Michigan for the minimum term of 20 years, the maximum term to be 30 years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-6\">\"The court makes no recommendation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-7\">\"You are remanded to the custody of the warden for execution of the sentence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-8\">\"You may be seated.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b754-9\">After repeated attempts<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the defendant finally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>succeeded in having the Court of Appeals overturn his convictions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b755-4\">Although the defendant implies in his brief that we should judge his 1962 guilty plea record by current standards, we emphasize that we believe the proper course is to evaluate the record according to the law as it existed at the time the plea was entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">Just as in <em>People v Armstrong, </em>390 Mich 693; 213 NW2d 190 (1973), where this Court declined to apply to a 1963 guilty plea a standard more stringent than the standard then in force, we are not inclined today to charge the trial judge below with anticipating the extensive and confusing develop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>ments in Michigan\u2019s guilty plea jurisprudence during the 14 years following the proceedings before him.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">In nullifying Mauch\u2019s guilty plea, the Court of Appeals rested its judgment on the ground that, since the record below fails to disclose any mention of the asportation<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> of the kidnapping victims, the plea is fatally defective under the rule of <em>People v Barrows, </em>358 Mich 267; 99 NW2d 347 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b756-7\"><em>Barrows, </em>however, does not stand for the proposition that a guilty plea record which fails to disclose mention of each element of the offense to which the plea of guilty is offered mandates setting aside the plea. The rule of the case in <em>Barrows, </em>a pre-GCR 1963, 785 case, was announced in the light of 1959 guilty plea procedures which were governed by a statute, MCLA 768.35; MSA 28.1058 and a court rule, Court Rule No. 35A (1945). The statute provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-8\">\"Whenever any person shall plead guilty to an information filed against him in any court, it shall be the duty of the judge of such court, before pronouncing judgment or sentence upon such plea, to become satisfied after such investigation as he may deem necessary for that purpose respecting the nature of the case, and the circumstances of such plea, that said plea was made freely, with full knowledge of the nature of the accusation, and without undue influence. And whenever said judge shall have reason to doubt the truth of such plea of guilty, it shall be his duty to vacate the same, direct a plea of not guilty to be entered and order a trial of the issue thus formed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b757-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>The court rule provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-4\">\"In every prosecution wherein the accused is charged with a felony the trial court shall conform to the following practice:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-5\">\"Sec. 2. Imposing sentence. If the accused pleads guilty, after such plea and before sentence the court shall inform the accused of the nature of the accusation and the consequence of his plea; and regardless of whether he is represented by counsel, the court shall examine the accused, not necessarily under oath, and as a condition of accepting the plea of guilty and imposing sentence shall ascertain that the plea was freely, understandingly and voluntarily made, without undue influence, compulsion or duress, and without promise of leniency. Unless the court determines that the plea of guilty was so made, it shall not be accepted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-6\">\"This rule is mandatory but failure to comply therewith shall not be considered jurisdictional.\u201d 318 Mich xxxix-xl.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b757-7\"><em>Barrows </em>merely supplied an additional dimension to the 1959 procedures in holding that the court-rule-mandated examination of the accused shall be by direct questioning for the purpose of establishing the crime and the defendant\u2019s participation therein. The purpose of the rule, the Court reasoned, is to preclude \"involuntary or induced false pleas\u201d, and \"subsequent false claims of innocence\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-8\">Aside from the procedural requirements outlined in the statute, the court rule and <em>Barrows, </em>the form of plea taking in 1962 was left to the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-9\">In <em>People v Bumpus, </em>355 Mich 374; 94 NW2d 854 (1959), this Court refused to set aside a guilty plea upon defendant\u2019s allegation that the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>court failed to comply with the statute and court rule. The Court stated the general rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-4\">\"Both our statutes and our court rules, quoted above, require that upon a plea of guilty to an information the judge shall satisfy himself that the plea was made freely, with knowledge of its consequences, and without undue influence or promise of leniency. The form and manner of this examination by the judge has not been prescribed but is left to the discretion of the judge, to be exercised by him in the manner best suited to the parties and the offense. The topic is discussed with clarity in <em>People v Coates, </em>337 Mich 56 [59 NW2d 83 (1953)].\u201d 355 Mich at 379-380.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">Later in the opinion, this Court clearly emphasized that the trial court\u2019s finding that the plea was freely and voluntarily entered carried great weight:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-6\">\"We do not lightly disregard the statement in the opinion of the sentencing judge that he conferred with defendant and assured himself that the defendant\u2019s plea was knowingly and freely made, and we find nothing in the record to impeach such statement. Moreover, 'Where it affirmatively appears that the judge made inquiry to satisfy himself that the plea of guilty entered expressed the real desire of the defendants, there can be no assumption that the defendant acted in ignorance or under compulsion.\u2019 8 MLP, Criminal Law, \u00a7 125, p 155.\u201d 355 Mich at 381-382.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b758-7\">In <em>People v Coates, </em>337 Mich 56; 59 NW2d 83 (1953), the defendant entered pleas of guilty to armed robbery and rape. The opinion indicates that the trial court elicited a detailed factual basis for the armed robbery charge, but nothing whatever for the rape charge other than the defendant\u2019s expressed desire to plead guilty to rape. The defendant challenged the adequacy of the court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>investigation, claimed his plea was coerced, and that he was denied the right to counsel, and asserted that the irregularity of the proceedings was contrary to the orderly administration of justice. In noting that the record disclosed that the trial court talked with the accused in chambers for 20 minutes to an hour prior to receiving the guilty pleas, this Court sustained the validity of the pleas, holding that the Court assumed' that the trial court complied with its statutory duty relative to the required investigation. The Court also considered the fact that the defendant, although 25 years old, was experienced in crime and was aware of the nature of the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">The principle announced in <em>Bumpus </em>and <em>Coates </em>is that the trial court must satisfy itself under the circumstances in the case that the plea was accurate and truthful, and freely, understandingly, and voluntarily entered. The method by which the court \"satisfied himself\u2019 was left to the trial judge. If the court accepted the plea, the resulting conviction carried with it a strong presumption of validity and reversal resulted only when the record affirmatively showed that the trial court neglected its statutory duty, <em>Edwards v People, </em>39 Mich 760 (1878), or conclusively demonstrated that the plea was involuntary or induced, <em>People v Merhige, </em>212 Mich 601; 180 NW 418 (1920).</p>\n<p id=\"b759-7\">In <em>People v Winegar, </em>380 Mich 719; 158 NW2d 395 (1968), this Court sustained the validity of a 1961 guilty plea. In that case the record failed to disclose any factual basis for the plea, and did not show that the defendant was advised of the consequences of his plea. The record did indicate, however, that before accepting the plea, the court had a private conference with the defendant in chambers. Thereafter, the court concluded on the record <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>that the defendant committed the crime and that he was freely, understandingly, and voluntarily pleading guilty. In affirming this conviction, the Court noted that a plea-based conviction is a judgment of the trial court and, as such, is presumptively valid. To overcome such a presumption, the Court held a showing must be made according to the harmless error statute, MCLA 769.26; MSA 28.1096, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-6\">\"No judgment or verdict shall be set aside or reversed or a new trial be granted by any court of this state in any criminal case, on the ground of misdirection of the jury, or the improper admission or rejection of evidence, or for error as to any matter of pleading or procedure, unless in the opinion of the court, after an examination of the entire cause, it shall affirmatively appear that the error complained of has resulted in a miscarriage of justice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b760-7\">The Court concluded that technical non-compliance with the statute or court rule then in effect<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> would not justify reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-8\">In the few guilty plea cases that had reached this Court at the time the plea was taken in the case at bar, non-compliance with statute or court rule did not result in reversal unless there were aggravating circumstances which indeed constituted a miscarriage of justice.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b761-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>In summary, while the present court rule, GCR 1963, 785.7 (1975), may require that in order that the validity of the guilty plea be sustained, it must be evident from the record that the defendant acknowledged his guilt to each and every element of the crime to which he pleads guilty, no such requirement existed at the time Mauch\u2019s plea in the instant case was taken. The thrust of the law governing the validity of guilty pleas in 1962, as mandated by statute, court rule and this Court\u2019s interpretation of both, was that the trial court personally address the defendant and satisfy himself that the defendant\u2019s guilty plea was both true and voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">After review of the entire case, we cannot say that this record, although indeed woefully inadequate by 1976 standards, was violative of 1962 requirements as regards the necessity that the record reflect the accused\u2019s understanding of the offense to which he pleads guilty, and that the trial court satisfy itself that the plea was both true and voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b761-7\">The defendant\u2019s second assignment of error\u2014 that his plea is fatally defective because the court did not advise him of the maximum penalty for kidnapping \u2014 is likewise without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-8\">In 1962 the trial court was not required to inform the defendant of the maximum sentence prescribed by law for the offense. We spoke to this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>issue in <em>People v Dunn, </em>380 Mich 693; 158 NW2d 404 (1968), in affirming a 1962 guilty plea in holding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-6\">\"We do not find that 'consequence of his plea\u2019 has been precisely defined in any prior decision of this Court as that phrase is used in [the court rule]. We here hold that the meaning of the 'consequence\u2019 of a plea of guilty, within the wording of the rule, is that an accused, by so pleading, waives his right to trial by jury, or trial without a jury by the court, and that additionally the accused subjects himself to whatever penalty is prescribed by law, including possible confinement in a penal institution. Under the rule, the accused must be advised minimally of the foregoing. Any additional information the trial judge is disposed to give to an accused rests in his discretion to be exercised according to the cirumstances.\u201d 380 Mich at 700-701.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b762-7\">The Court stated further that the purpose of such advice was to insure that the plea was freely made.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-8\">In the case at bar, the court did \"minimally\u201d advise the defendant, after he entered his plea, that the court would pass sentence that morning. He did not, in so many words, inform the defendant that a guilty plea waived a trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-9\">Under the circumstances of this case, however, it is difficult to conclude from this omission that a miscarriage of justice occurred as required by the statute prior to reversal of a criminal conviction, especially in light of the fact that 48 hours earlier the defendant was twice informed that he had a right to be tried by a jury. Moreover, the defendant was represented by counsel: he was 39 years old at the time of his plea; and he was familiar with criminal proceedings. In fact, at the time he pled guilty he was serving a life sentence for another crime. Upon questioning by the court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>defendant asserted that he freely and voluntarily entered his guilty plea. Furthermore, there are no other \"aggravating circumstances\u201d in this case, unlike the cases cited, fn 5 <em>supra, </em>which would justify a finding of a miscarriage of justice requiring setting the plea aside. The plea, therefore, must stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">In reaching this conclusion, we reiterate that we are dealing at bar with a 1962 guilty plea. We emphasize that <em>Guilty Plea Cases, </em>395 Mich 96; 235 NW2d 132 (1975), represents the present state of the law regarding the acceptance of guilty pleas. We decline, however, to give the defendant in this case the benefit of this decision which was rendered more than 13 years after he entered his plea of guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b763-8\">Finally, the defendant contends that if his plea is upheld by this Court, the matter should be remanded to the trial court for resentencing because there was no presentence report prepared, as required by MCLA 771.14; MSA 28.1144. In <em>People v Brown, </em>393 Mich 174; 224 NW2d 38 (1974), we held that it is error to sentence a defendant without benefit of a presentence report, and limited application of this rule to cases then pending on appeal in which the issue was preserved and to convictions occurring thereafter. The record indicates that defendant first raised this issue in his application for leave to file a delayed motion for new trial filed with the trial court on January 19, 1970, and renewed it in subsequent applications. It is argued therefore that Mauch\u2019s case was \"pending on appeal\u201d when <em>Brown </em>was decided in 1974.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-9\">However, we conclude that in order to give <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number><em>Brown </em>limited retroactivity, as was our stated intention, the phrase \"pending on appeal\u201d should be construed to include only cases pending on timely direct appeal from the trial court or on timely application to this Court from Court of Appeals decisions. We hold, therefore, that <em>Brown </em>does not require us to remand this case for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">The Court of Appeals is reversed and the conviction and sentence reinstated.</p>\n<judges id=\"b764-6\">Coleman, Fitzgerald, and Lindemer, JJ., concurred with Ryan, J.</judges>\n<author id=\"b764-7\">Levin, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ar0\">Mauch was convicted in 1962 on his plea of guilty to two counts of kidnapping and sentenced to serve a term of 20 to 30 years.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b764-8\">The Court of Appeals set aside his conviction in 1975 on the ground that the failure of the trial judge to establish an element of the offense, asportation,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> during the plea-taking colloquoy violated the rule of <em>People v Barrows, </em>358 Mich 267; 99 NW2d 347 (1959), requiring that there be a factual basis for the plea. The Court said that <em>People v Taylor, </em>387 Mich 209; 195 NW2d 856 (1972), precludes resort to the transcript of the preliminary examination to establish the missing element.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-9\">Mauch\u2019s plea of guilty was accepted before the 1973 revision of the court rule, GCR 1963, 785.7,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> delineating for the first time in the rule the <em>Barrows </em>factual-basis requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-10\">In a number of delayed appeals from guilty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>pleas accepted before the revision of the court rule this Court has allowed the factual basis to be established by evidence other than direct questioning of the defendant. The question whether a preliminary examination transcript may be considered in such a case has not been definitively resolved.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-4\">We would hold that on delayed appeal from a conviction entered before revision of the court rule a preliminary examination transcript may be considered in deciding whether there is an adequate factual basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">Mauch also contends that his plea should be set aside because he was not aware of the maximum sentence and, alternatively, that resentencing is required because the judge did not obtain a presentence report.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">This case was not pending on appeal when <em>People v Brown, </em>393 Mich 174, 181; 224 NW2d 38 (1974), was decided and, therefore, under the rule of that case, the failure of the judge to obtain a presentence report before sentencing does not require or permit remand for sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-7\">Before the 1963 revision, the court rule did not specifically require that the judge advise the defendant of the maximum sentence. The judge in this case did not do so. It does not appear whether Mauch was aware before he pled guilty that the maximum sentence for kidnapping is life or any term of years.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-8\">We would affirm Mauch\u2019s conviction without prejudice to his establishing in the trial court on delayed motion that he is entitled to have his conviction set aside on the ground that he was not aware of the maximum possible sentence and in consequence his plea was not an understanding and voluntary plea within the meaning of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>court rule and minimum requirements of the Due Process Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">The judge\u2019s questions and Mauch\u2019s responses do not establish a factual basis. Mauch\u2019s affirmative answer to the judge\u2019s question posed in the statutory language: \"Did you * * * 'confine\u2019 [the victim] 'against [his] will\u2019?\u201d tells us scarcely more than Mauch is willing to plead guilty. It provides no assurance that whatever he may have done would support a conviction at a trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">In <em>People v Barrows, supra, </em>p 272, this Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-7\">\"The direct questioning of a defendant by the trial judge on plea of guilty is required by the rule for the purpose of establishing the crime and the participation therein of the person pleading guilty. This is a precaution against involuntary or induced false pleas of guilty, and against subsequent false claims of innocence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b766-8\"><em>Barrows </em>has been reaffirmed by this Court in a number of opinions, some deciding long delayed appeals.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b767-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>In <em>People v Taylor, supra, </em>this Court applied the <em>Barrows </em>requirement in setting aside a 1960 guilty plea. Mauch\u2019s plea was in 1962.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-4\">A 1963 guilty plea conviction was reversed for failure to comply with <em>Barrows </em>in <em>People v Carlisle, </em>387 Mich 269, 273; 195 NW2d 851 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">In <em>People v Haack, </em>396 Mich 367, 371-373; 240 NW2d 704 (1976), where the plea was accepted before the 1973 revision, this Court said: \"While former rule 785 and the statute did not explicitly require a determination that there was a factual basis, such a requirement was established by judicial construction of the rule and statute in <em>People </em>vBarrows.\u201dWe concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-6\">\"In reviewing convictions on pleas of guilty accepted before the 1973 revision of rule 785, this Court followed the <em>Barrows </em>rule requiring a factual basis supporting the conclusion that a crime was committed and that defendant participated in its commission.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b767-7\">While this Court has consistently required, in accordance with <em>Barrows, </em>that a factual basis be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>established, in delayed appeals it has found an adequate factual basis on evidence other than the defendant\u2019s responses to questions by the judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">In <em>People v Stearns; </em>380 Mich 704; 158 NW2d 409 (1968), a 1961 conviction was affirmed on evidence that the defendant made statements establishing a factual basis during the presentence investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">The Court did not refer to <em>Barrows </em>in <em>People v Winegar, </em>380 Mich 719, 725; 158 NW2d 395 (1968). Before accepting that 1961 guilty plea the judge said that he had \"conferred with Mr. Winegar relative to the circumstances of the crime, is convinced that he committed the crime\u201d. The conference had taken place in chambers in accordance with the former practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-7\">A prosecutor\u2019s statement of the factual basis during the plea-taking colloquoy and defendant\u2019s acquiescence were held sufficient to support a pre<em>Barrows </em>plea in <em>People v Rufus Williams, </em>386 Mich 277; 192 NW2d 466 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b768-8\">In this case, the presentence report is not part of the record and, it appears, cannot be produced. There is no suggestion that a factual basis was established during an in-chambers examination. Nor is there a statement by the prosecutor or questioning of Mauch by his lawyer<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> establishing a factual basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b768-10\">A preliminary examination was conducted and it was there established that Mauch \"pled guilty to an offense of which he might have been convicted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>at trial\u201d. <em>Guilty Plea Cases, </em>395 Mich 96, 129; 235 NW2d 132 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b769-4\">Two police officers testified that Mauch and another person disarmed, handcuffed and placed them in the rear of a police car. The officers were then driven a number of miles and handcuffed to a tree. The offense and Mauch\u2019s participation, a factual basis for the plea, were thus established.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">The jurisprudence of this state is unsettled regarding resort on delayed appeal from conviction on a guilty plea accepted before the 1973 revision of the court rule to a preliminary examination transcript to demonstrate a factual basis for the plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">In <em>People v Zaleski, </em>375 Mich 71, 81; 133 NW2d 175 (1965), this Court declared that a judge may not, in exercising his discretion to grant or deny a motion to withdraw a guilty plea, consider the \"frequently one-sided preliminary examination testimony\u201d as evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">The issue of factual basis does not relate to guilt or innocence, but to whether there is evidence on which the trier of fact might have convicted the defendant at a trial. A defendant can protest his innocence and yet plead guilty if his plea, under all the circumstances, is an informed, understanding choice of the alternatives that confront him.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b769-8\">The question here relates to resort on delayed appeal to a preliminary examination transcript. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>Statements in earlier cases that examination transcripts may not be considered for that purpose are not of precedential stature.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">The plurality opinion in <em>People v Schneff, </em>392 Mich 15, 26; 219 NW2d 47 (1974), signed by three justices, declared that \"the trial judge erred in considering the preliminary examination testimony when accepting the defendant\u2019s guilty plea\u201d. Schneffs conviction was affirmed on the ground that a factual basis had been established. Two justices concurred in the result and one justice concurred by separate opinion. A majority of the sitting Court did not sign the plurality opinion. The plurality statement in <em>Schneff is </em>not precedential^ binding on this Court. <em>Negri v Slotkin, </em>397 Mich 105, 109; 244 NW2d 98 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">In <em>People v Rufus Williams, supra, </em>the plurality opinion<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> eschewed reliance on the preliminary examination transcript in reviewing a <em>pre-Barrows </em>plea.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b770-7\">In <em>People v Taylor, supra, </em>p 225, fn 10, this Court said that \"[i]t is not sufficient that such facts appear on the record of the preliminary examination. See <em>People v Zaleski, </em>375 Mich 71, 81 (1965), and <em>People v Rufus Williams, </em>386 Mich 277, 284-285 (1971).\u201d However, neither <em>Zaleski </em>nor <em>Williams </em>resolved the question. Moreover, the <em>Taylor </em>statement was <em>obiter dictum. </em>Taylor had waived preliminary examination. The question of resort on delayed appeal to a preliminary examination transcript to demonstrate a factual basis was neither briefed nor argued.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>Reaffirming, as emphasized in our opinion in <em>Guilty Plea Cases, supra, </em>that there is no adequate substitute for direct questioning by the judge of the defendant, we, nevertheless, conclude that it would be inconsistent with the sound administration of justice to set aside a 1962 guilty plea on the ground that a factual basis was not established where the preliminary examination transcript demonstrates that the defendant pled guilty to an offense of which he might have been convicted at trial and a basis is thereby provided for \"reasonable ascertainment of the truth of the plea.\u201d <em>People v Barrows, supra, </em>p 272.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-5\">\"Efforts to improve the quality and raise standards in the administration of justice are, however, sometimes impeded by an insistence on applying a newly-established or newly-enforced standard in cases where the judgments of conviction have long ago become final. Those efforts are also sometimes impeded by a rigid and inflexible application of the improved standard in current cases. Unless the <em>Barrows </em>direct-questioning requirement is enforced with sufficient flexibility to make allowances for inadvertent oversight by a conscientious judge<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and for those cases where guilty pleas were taken before <em>Barrows </em>was decided, the likelihood is that pressure from the trial bench and the reality of the number of convictions that would be reversed and cases retried, adding to the backlog of our overburdened trial courts, would erode the direct questioning requirement altogether. A pragmatic philosopher cautioned us that 'the best is the enemy of the good.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b771-7\">My colleague\u2019s opinion refers to the harmless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>error statute<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and states that the present court rule \"may\u201d require an acknowledgment of guilt of each and every element of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">We recently considered at considerable length a large number of appeals from guilty plea convictions in an effort to establish a sound and principled procedure for the acceptance of a plea of guilty and a workable standard for appellate review of plea-based convictions. <em>Guilty Plea Cases, supra. </em>This Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Guilty Plea Cases, supra, </em>p 128, states that unless the record shows compliance with the factual basis requirement the case is to be remanded for supplementation of the record and if a factual basis cannot on remand be established the plea shall be set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">We disassociate ourselves from any suggestion that judgments of conviction on guilty pleas accepted after the 1973 revision of the court rule are to be reviewed by a standard not stated in <em>Guilty Plea Cases </em>or that the record may be adequate without a showing that the defendant might have been convicted of the offense at a trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b772-8\">The court rule now requires that the judge state the maximum and any minimum prison sentence before accepting a plea of guilty.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The rule in effect when Mauch pled guilty did not specifically require advice regarding a statutory minimum or the maximum sentence.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>The judge did not, before accepting Mauch\u2019s plea of guilty, determine whether he was aware that the maximum sentence for kidnapping is life or any term of years.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">This Court has held that the length of the sentence is not a \"consequence\u201d of a guilty plea within the meaning of the former court rule. <em>People v Dunn, </em>380 Mich 693, 700; 158 NW2d 404 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b773-7\">The question whether a defendant\u2019s awareness of the maximum sentence is a factor to be considered in determining whether his plea is \"understandingly and voluntarily made\u201d within the meaning of the former rule and minimum constitutional requirements was left unresolved by this Court\u2019s decision in <em>People v Ferguson, </em>383 Mich 645; 178 NW2d 490 (1970), affirming by an equally divided vote a decision of the Court of Appeals.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b773-8\">In many jurisdictions, as in Michigan, the issue is now resolved by court rule or statute requiring that the judge inform the defendant of the maximum sentence.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b773-9\">Courts in other jurisdictions, noting the constitutional roots of the knowing and understanding standard, have held that awareness of the maximum sentence is a prerequisite to a valid plea of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>guilty.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Where the record fails to show that the defendant was aware of the maximum sentence a hearing on that issue is required.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">A hearing has not been held on the question whether Mauch was aware of the maximum sentence. Absent a finding following a hearing that Mauch w\u00e1s unaware of the maximum sentence, there is not a factual predicate for further consideration whether his plea was understanding and voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-7\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b774-8\"><em>People v Brown, supra, </em>does not require or permit a remand for sentencing. In that case, this Court held that it is error to sentence a defendant in a felony case without first obtaining a presentence report. We gave this holding limited retroactivity:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-9\">\"We will apply the rule articulated in this case only to those cases now pending on appeal in which this issue has been preserved and to those cases resulting from charges made on and after the date of this opinion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b774-10\">Mauch was convicted long before the date of the <em>Brown </em>decision. His case was not pending on appeal when <em>Brown </em>was decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-11\">By the use, in such context, of the phrase \"pending on appeal\u201d, this Court means cases pending on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>timely direct appeal from the trial court to the Court of Appeals or on timely application to this Court from the decision of the Court of Appeals. If an appeal from a grant or denial of a delayed motion for a new trial or on a delayed application for leave to appeal was timely for this purpose then, contrary to the evident purpose to give <em>Brown </em>limited retroactivity, the rule of that case would in effect be fully retroactive.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-4\">Reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b775-5\">Kavanagh, C.

On January 25, 1962, defendant pled guilty to two separate informations, each charging him with kidnapping a policeman and was sentenced to concurrent terms of 20 to 30 years in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-12\">2. On March 8, 1966, a delayed motion for new trial was denied by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-13\">3. On January 30, 1969, defendant\u2019s application for leave to file a delayed appeal was denied by the Court of Appeals for lack of merit. (Docket No. 2694.)</p>\n<p id=\"b754-14\">4. On August 26, 1969, this Court denied defendant\u2019s application for leave to appeal on the grounds that defendant had failed to persuade the Court that he had a meritorious basis for appeal, 382 Mich 778.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-15\">5. On January 19, 1970, defendant filed an application for leave to file a second delayed motion for a new trial and on April 17, 1970 filed an addendum.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-16\">6. On or about October 2, 1970, defendant filed a motion for evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-17\">7. On October 8, 1970, the trial court denied defendant\u2019s application for leave to file a second delayed motion for new trial and motion for evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-18\">8. On November 2, 1970, defendant filed an application for rehearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-19\">9. On August 2, 1971, a supplemental brief in support of the application for rehearing was filed and another supplemental brief was filed on December 30, 1971.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-20\">10. On December 30, 1971, after nearly a year of ill health, the trial court denied the application for rehearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-21\">11. On June 26, 1972, the Court of Appeals denied defendant\u2019s second application for leave to appeal for lack of merit on the grounds presented. (Docket Nos. 14146, 14147.)</p>\n<p id=\"b754-22\">12. On September 13, 1972, this Court granted defendant\u2019s second application for leave to appeal, vacated the conviction, and remanded the case to the trial court, 388 Mich 778 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b754-23\">13. On January 31, 1973, this Court denied the people\u2019s application for rehearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-24\">14. On February 28, 1973, this Court on its own motion decided that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>the January 31, 1973 order was erroneously entered, set it aside, granted the application for rehearing, set aside the order of September 13, 1972, and denied defendant\u2019s second application for leave to appeal for failure to persuade the Court that he had a meritorious basis for appeal, 389 Mich 769 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">15. On April 3, 1973, defendant\u2019s application for rehearing was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"Agx\">16. On or about October 12, 1973, defendant filed another application for leave to file a delayed motion to vacate guilty pleas, claiming the kidnap statute was unconstitutional, which was denied by an order dated December 18, 1973.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-10\">17. Defendant filed a third application for leave to appeal with the Court of Appeals, again claiming that <em>People v Adams, </em>389 Mich 222; 205 NW2d 415 (1973), held the kidnap statute under which he pled guilty unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-11\">18. On March 8, 1974, the Court of Appeals granted leave to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-12\">19. On March 16, 1974, the people filed an application for rehearing, pointing out the numerous times this case had been previously considered, and asked at the very least for the Court of Appeals to outline the issue or issues on which it decided to grant leave to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-13\">20. By an order dated March 29, 1974, and certified April 1, 1974, the Court of Appeals refused to outline the issue on which leave was granted or to recognize the amount of appellate review which defendant\u2019s case has already received.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-14\">21. In a per curiam opinion dated February 14, 1975, the Court of Appeals reversed defendant\u2019s two guilty pleas to kidnapping on the basis of the asportation discussion in <em>Adams, </em>holding that <em>Adams </em>is fully retroactive.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b755-15\"> D.
