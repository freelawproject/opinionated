We likewise affirm after having examined and answered the following questions in the negative:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-5\">(1) Whether reversal is required because the trial court did not <em>sua sponte </em>instruct the jury that the testimony of an addict-informer was to be received with care and caution;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-6\">(2) Whether the uncorroborated testimony of an addict-informer is insufficient as a matter of law to make a jury-submissible issue on defendant\u2019s guilt; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-7\">(3) . Whether the jury was misled by a failure to disclose the possibility of future favorable treatment for the addict-informer testifying against defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">The indictment alleged that the unlawful sale took place on or about March 12, 1971, in the City of Kalamazoo. Testimony at trial indicated that in the afternoon of that date, one Edward Nero telephoned the Kalamazoo Police Department and informed a Detective Walker that Nero had arranged to purchase heroin from the defendant. Nero had been an informer for that department for some six months. Around 10 p.m., Detective Walker and a policewoman met Nero near the place of the arranged purchase. Walker, who had worked with Nero on previous occasions, performed a pat-down search of Nero\u2019s person and searched Nero\u2019s car by looking on the front and rear seats, under the seats and in the glove compartment. Walker gave Nero a $20 bill after re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>cording the serial number. Nero then drove his car to the place where the purchase was to be made. Walker and the policewoman followed in their unmarked vehicle. They saw Nero disappear behind a house located at 216 W. Patterson Street. They saw him emerge from behind that house 10 minutes later, get back into his car, and drive to the original meeting place where he turned over to them two packets of what subsequently proved to be heroin.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">Nero\u2019s testimony supplied the only evidence directly linking defendant with the sale. The fact of Nero\u2019s long history of heroin use, his criminal record, and his possible motives for fabrication were thoroughly explored by defense counsel. Defense counsel highlighted several contradictions in Nero\u2019s testimony. It was also revealed that there was a breaking and entering charge pending against Nero and that he was in jeopardy of probation revocation. By questioning a Kalamazoo County Sheriffs deputy, it was revealed that when Nero was arrested in late January 1971 on the breaking and entering charge, Nero proposed a deal whereby he would become an informer for the sheriffs department in return for dismissal of the charge. However, the deputy testified that no such agreement was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">Defense counsel did not request any special jury instructions pertaining to Nero\u2019s credibility, and stated that he had no objections to the instructions that were given. The jury, having full knowledge of Nero\u2019s character, history, and possible expectations of reward, returned a verdict on August 12, 1971, of guilty as charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-8\">On November 29, 1971, the prosecutor petitioned for nolle prosequi of the breaking and entering charges pending against Nero, on the grounds that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>he had returned the stolen property and had \"rendered great assistance in the area of the narcotics traffic within Kalamazoo County\u201d including testimony which had \"resulted in pleas and convictions regarding narcotics violations\u201d. The petition for order of nolle prosequi was granted by the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">The trend of Federal criminal trial practice is now to require a special cautionary instruction regarding the testimony of government witnesses who are narcotics addicts and who are paid informers or who have criminal charges against them.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In Michigan, there is no similar tradition of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>judicial decision in the area of special instructions pertaining to the credibility of addict-informers. This may be due to the fact that state courts in general have retreated further than Federal courts from the common-law tradition of liberal judicial comment on the evidence in jury trials.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">Michigan statute<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and court rule<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> condition the requirement of an instruction on a request therefor. This requirement is binding where, as here, defendant predicates no error on the instructions actually given, but rather contends that the trial court on its own motion should have instructed in an area where no tradition of state judicial decision exists. While this Court would not be adverse to a cautionary instruction where the uncorroborated testimony of an addict-informer is the only evidence linking the accused with the alleged offense, there must be a proper request. Focusing special attention or particular suspicion on a wit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>ness or class of witnesses can be a risky business. Both sides should be given the opportunity to develop the record with respect to the fairness of such a proposed instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">In <em>People v McCoy, </em>392 Mich 231, 236-238; 220 NW2d 456 (1974), this Court dealt with a related area of jury instructions regarding the credibility of accomplices. A majority of this Court therein held prospectively that it would be reversible error \"to fail upon request to give a cautionary instruction concerning accomplice testimony and, if the issue is closely drawn, it may be reversible error to fail to give such a cautionary instruction even in the absence of a request to charge\u201d.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This holding does not require reversal in the instant case, nor are we of the opinion that in the interests of justice it should be so extended. First, the <em>McCoy </em>rule under discussion was given prospective application for the reason that it went beyond long-established Michigan precedent to the effect that special instructions regarding credibility was a matter within the sound discretion of the trial court. Second, there was no imbalance in the instructions given in the instant case. In <em>McCoy, </em>error was found in the trial court\u2019s failure to balance care and caution language actually used in the instruction on alibi with similar language relating to the accomplice who testified against the defendant. Third, the jury in the case at bar was fully apprised of the criminal past, and possible motivation of witness Nero. It would not be an unfair assessment of the record herein to say that as much testimony was elicited on the issue of Nero\u2019s credibility as on that of defendant\u2019s guilt or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>innocence. Defense strategy from the outset was to put witness Nero on trial. In the face of this clear strategy, we cannot assume that defense counsel lightly disregarded the possibility of requesting a cautionary instruction or that such an instruction would have been refused if requested. Under the circumstances, MCLA 768.29; MSA 28.1052, and GCR 1963, 516.1 and 516.2 are controlling.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">Defendant urges this Court to follow the Illinois rule<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> that the uncorroborated testimony of an addict-informer is insufficient as a matter of law to make a jury-submissible case, and that his motion to dismiss at the close of the people\u2019s proofs should have been granted. Most recently, this Court has stated that it \"has steadfastly supported the right of the trier of fact, particularly the jury, to believe, or disbelieve, in whole or in part, any of the evidence presented\u201d.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We hold that the credibility of an addict-informer, like that of an accomplice,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> is a jury question, and that the jury may convict on such testimony alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b274-9\">Defendant has produced no facts of record, by way of a motion for new trial based on newly-discovered evidence or otherwise, indicating that an agreement for Nero\u2019s testimony existed at the time of trial. Instead, he asserts that it would be incredibly naive to believe that there was neither an actual nor incipient deal; that if there was no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>actual bargain at the time of trial, Nero and the prosecutor knew there would be one within a short period of time. The prosecutor maintains that there was no agreement at the time of defendant\u2019s trial, and that subsequent dismissal of the charge against Nero resulted from several factors, some of which had no relation to defendant\u2019s trial. Nero, says the prosecutor, returned the property stolen during the breaking and entering and, most importantly, \"blew his cover\u201d by testifying at this trial and others so as to be of no further use in undercover work.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">It would be atypical if an addict-informer did not have an expectation of consideration for his cooperation in a given case. The well of informer cooperation would soon run dry if law enforcement consistently adhered to a policy of no consideration. Furthermore, we would not be so paternalistic as to believe that jurors are not well aware of these facts of life.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">Where an accomplice or co-conspirator has been granted immunity or other leniency to secure his testimony, it is incumbent upon the prosecutor and the trial judge, if the fact comes to the court\u2019s attention, to disclose such fact to the jury upon request of defense counsel.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The same requirement of disclosure should also be applicable if reasonable expectations, as opposed to promises, of leniency or other rewards for testifying resulted from contact with the prosecutor. It has been held to be a denial of due process for a prosecutor not to correct the testimony of such a witness against the defendant, where the witness testifies that he has been promised no consideration for his testimony and the prosecutor knows this statement to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>false.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In regard to this duty to disclose, the prosecutor\u2019s office has been treated as an entity, and the promise of one of its attorneys, even if unknown to the assistant prosecutor trying the case, has been attributed to the state.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">However, it is one thing to require disclosure of facts (immunity or leniency) which the jury should weigh in assessing a witness\u2019s credibility. It is quite another to require \"disclosure\u201d of future possibilities for the jury\u2019s speculation. Indeed, if a prosecutor were required to volunteer that, although there was no agreement, he intended to recommend some sort of consideration for a witness because the witness was testifying in this and other cases or had corrected his past misdeeds, could this not be viewed as vouching for that witness\u2019s credibility? The focus of required disclosure is not on factors which may motivate a prosecutor in dealing subsequently with a witness, but rather on facts which may motivate the witness in giving certain testimony. Of the latter, this jury was made well aware by means of the thorough and probing cross-examination by defense counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b276-7\">Kavanagh, C.

This language has even lead defendants to request that the court instruct the jury as a matter of law that addict-informers are inherently perjurers, but refusals to so request have been sustained on appeal. <em>Government of the Virgin Islands v Hendricks, </em>476 F2d 776 (CA 3, 1973). <em>United States v Gregorio, </em>497 F2d 1253 (CA 4, 1974). The general language of the instruction is to the effect that the testimony of an addict-informer who is either paid or under pressure must be examined with greater scrutiny than that of an ordinary witness. <em>United States v Masino, </em>275 F2d 129 (CA 2, 1960). The precise terms of the instruction have been left to the trial court whose ultimate responsibility it is to formulate the charge. One version of an instruction on informers can be found in 1 Devitt and Blackmar, Federal Jury Practice and Instructions (2d ed), \u00a7 12.02. The Devitt and Blackmar instruction does not specify the unique danger said to be present in the testimony of addict-informers. Another more general instruction on interested witness testimony can be found in Mathes, <em>Jury Instructions and Forms for Federal Criminal Cases, </em>27 FRD 39, 68 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-9\">The dangers inherent in such testimony are said to include the addict\u2019s fear of being jailed or deprived of access to drugs, and also the fear of retaliation from others in the drug trade. <em>United States v Kinnard, </em>150 US App DC 386; 465 F2d 566, 571 (1972).

Compare <em>United States v Griffin, </em>382 F2d 823 (CA 6, 1967), where the trial court failed to give the unrequested cautionary instruction, and instructed erroneously on a presumption of truth attaching to a witness\u2019 testimony unless outweighed by evidence to the contrary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b272-9\"> 9 Wigmore, Evidence (3d ed), \u00a7 2551.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b272-10\">MCLA 768.29; MSA 28.1052, reads in part: \"The failure of the court to instruct on any point of law shall not be ground for setting aside the verdict of the jury unless such instruction is requested by the accused.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b272-11\"> GCR 1963, 516.1 and .2 read in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-12\">\".1 Request for Instructions.

Atkins <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>was convicted on August 12, 1971. On November 29, 1971, the court entered an order of nolle prosequi on the breaking and entering charge on the prosecutor\u2019s representations that the stolen property had been returned and Nero had \"rendered great assistance in the area of narcotics traffic\u201d including testimony which had \"resulted in pleas and convictions regarding narcotics violations\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">At Atkins\u2019 trial, Nero denied that he had been promised leniency.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">Nero offered to become a police informer in the fall of 1970 after he was convicted and before sentencing for a theft offense; he was placed on probation for that offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">The subsequently nol-prossed breaking and entering offense was apparently committed in violation of a condition of Nero\u2019s probation. Nero testified that he was using drugs at the time of the purchase from Atkins.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">Nero\u2019s history of narcotic addiction was amply probed at the trial. He said that he renewed the use of narcotics in connection with his work as an informer as it was necessary to appear to be an addict to make buys from drug dealers. He was not using drugs at the time of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">The closing arguments were not transcribed. We, therefore, do not know how this case went to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-9\">The pendency of the breaking and entering charge was made known to the jury. Defense counsel declared: \"With this kind of man, I think that there is the possibility, and I intend to argue this very strongly, that in his mind there might be a deal\u201d. Defense counsel may have argued without protest or contradiction by the prosecutor that despite the lack of a formal agreement Nero justi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>fiably expected that by testifying for the people he might obtain favorable treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">In the context of that statement of defense counsel and the failure to record the closing arguments,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> I cannot predicate reversible error and concur in affirmance of defendant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">I agree with my colleagues that a prima facie case may be made on the uncorroborated testimony of a witness who has reason to fabricate his testimony and that no distinction in this regard can properly be drawn between interested witnesses generally and addict informers in particular.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">We also agree that, absent a request for a cautionary instruction, a trial judge is not obliged to instruct the jury regarding the special scrutiny it should give informer testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">If such an instruction is requested, the judge should give it. An informer facing, prosecution for an offense or whose use of drugs in violation of law and of a condition of probation is tolerated by the authorities has the same motive to fabricate as an accomplice. See <em>People v McCoy, </em>392 Mich 231, 236; 220 NW2d 456 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-9\">I further agree that Atkins is not entitled to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>new trial simply because the breaking and entering charge against Nero was dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">Rewarding accomplices and informers with leniency or exculpation for their transgressions of the law in exchange for testimony and evidence to convict another person is an accepted prosecutorial practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">Atkins did not move for a new trial or for an evidentiary hearing whereat he might seek to establish that there was an undisclosed arrangement with Nero. The dismissal of the breaking and entering charge and the failure to charge probation violation do not in and of themselves establish that such concessions were pursuant to an agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">Although the record does not support a conclusion that there was an agreement, the probability is that there was a tacit understanding.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b279-9\">I question the usefulness of a distinction between the \"disclosure of facts (immunity or leniency) which the jury should weigh in assessing a witness\u2019s credibility\u201d and \" 'disclosure\u2019 of future possibilities for the jury\u2019s speculation\u201d. Some future possibilities may, indeed, appear so extravagant as to be fanciful. Others will, however, have sufficient substantiality to induce \"reasonable expectations, as opposed to promises, of leniency or other rewards\u201d and may motivate fabricated testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-10\">The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>\"Concededly promises of immunity are admissible; they are, however, rarely made.

And however strong may be his belief of the prisoner\u2019s guilt, he must remember that, though unfair means may happen to result in doing justice to the prisoner in the particular case, yet, justice so attained, is unjust and dangerous to the whole community.\u201d <em>Hurd v People, </em>25 Mich 405, 416 (1872).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b282-12\">A statement by an accomplice-informer witness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>that no promise has been made to him is misleading although no positive promise has been made if he has a reasonable expectation of leniency or other reward. The statement is not wholly true as it conceals the witness\u2019s expectations, expectations fostered by the practice of granting concessions to accomplice-informer witnesses. The apparent purpose of knowing concealment and a failure to correct the record is to mislead the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">Michigan civil jurisprudence fully supports the \" 'silence-fraud\u2019 rule\u201d. <em>Williams v Benson, </em>3 Mich App 9; 141 NW2d 650 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">In an early case, <em>Kenyon v Woodruff, </em>33 Mich 310, 314 (1876), this Court approved instructions allowing recovery for fraudulent representation \"in stating what was particularly and directly untrue and also in <em>stating but part of the truth </em>in respect to other matters\u201d. (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b283-8\">In <em>Sullivan v Ulrich, </em>326 Mich 218, 229; 40 NW2d 126 (1949), this Court held that a seller had made a misrepresentation to a purchaser where, although the answers were truthful, the tendency was to convey a \"false impression\u201d.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-9\">\"Failure to disclose a material fact necessary to prevent a false impression is as much a fraud as positive misrepresentation. It is not essential that the pretenses by which a fraud is accomplished be expressed in words.\u201d <em>Michigan National Bank v Marston, </em>29 Mich App 99, 104; 185 NW2d 47 (1970).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-10\">\"In Michigan, even without a fiduciary relationship, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>party is under a duty to use diligence in making a complete disclosure of facts where partial disclosure may convey false impressions and mislead the plaintiff. Such half-truths or non-disclosures are considered to be concealment of facts and, therefore, misrepresentations. <em>Groening v Opsata, </em>323 Mich 73; 34 NW2d 560 (1948).

Judges frequently allow charge reduction and grant sentencing leniency to such witnesses to assist law enforcement. In this case, the judge granted a nolle prosequi on the prosecutor\u2019s representation that Nero had assisted in obtaining convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">A judge, aware of such practices, aware of the expectations of accomplice-informer witnesses and that they are in a measure justified by what in fact occurs, should, without a request by defense counsel, require a statement by the prosecutor of the practice or either take judicial notice, as in my <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>colleague\u2019s opinion, of, or permit the defendant to prove, the practice.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">We are at approximately the same juncture regarding concessions to accomplice-informers as we were until recently in regard to disclosure of plea-bargaining concessions. A short time ago it was bad form for a defendant to acknowledge, in response to the judge\u2019s question, \"have any promises been made to you?\u201d, that there was a plea bargain. The judge might even refuse to accept a plea of guilty if the defendant responded, truthfully, that there had been plea bargaining; in order to obtain the plea bargain defendants were expected to deny it.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">The practice of granting leniency to accomplice-informer witnesses should be spread fully on the record.</p>\n<judges id=\"b286-6\">Kavanagh, C.
