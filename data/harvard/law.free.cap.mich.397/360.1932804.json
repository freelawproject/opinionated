We conclude that Recorder\u2019s Court did have jurisdiction of this matter and that defendant may not successfully attack his plea of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>guilty on the basis that it was involuntarily induced by his confession.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">Janice Ott was stabbed to death in the hallway of her Detroit apartment building on December 22, 1971. Underneath her body, the police found a hat. In the hatband was a slip of paper. A purse containing the victim\u2019s identification but no money was found in the parking lot behind her apartment. Names and telephone numbers on the slip of paper found in the hat led the police to the O\u2019Neil home on December 28, 1971. Defendant, born February 14, 1955, had been residing with the O\u2019Neils, his cousins. Defendant\u2019s mother was deceased and the whereabouts of his father unknown. The O\u2019Neils are an adult and married couple.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">When the police came to the O\u2019Neil home, they were admitted into the house by defendant. He was placed under arrest for the murder of Janice Ott. While in the home, the police seized two coats which appeared to have blood on them. Defendant was taken to the Youth Home. On December 29, the police asked permission of the probate court to take the defendant to police headquarters for the purpose of taking a blood sample and hair sample, and the giving of a polygraph test. The probate court advised that the police would have to first obtain the consent of the O\u2019Neils. This was done. The O\u2019Neils then accompanied the defendant before a referee of the juvenile court. Defendant was advised by the referee that he had the right to have an attorney and that one would be appointed for him if he could not afford one. He was told that he had the right not to make a statement, and that statements made by him or the results of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>tests performed could be used against him. Defendant indicated that he understood these rights and agreed to submit to the blood, hair and polygraph tests.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">At police headquarters a hematologist-serologist took hair samples and blood from the defendant in the presence of Mrs. O\u2019Neil. This technician testified at defendant\u2019s waiver hearing and later at the preliminary examination in recorder\u2019s court that, because of chemical damage to the hair of defendant, it was possible to match with certainty these hair samples with hair found on the victim\u2019s coat. Further, blood found on the defendant\u2019s jacket did not match his blood type, but did match the victim\u2019s relatively rare AB blood type.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">Defendant was then taken to the polygraph room where, in the presence of Mrs. O\u2019Neil, he was read a standard constitutional rights form. He then read the form. The police then had defendant write on the rights form the reason why he wanted to take the test. He wrote \"To prove that I didn\u2019t do it\u201d, and then signed the form. Upon completion of the polygraph, the operator told defendant that he had failed the test. Defendant then said \"I did it. I stabbed her.\u201d Defendant then gave a more detailed statement to the police completely implicating himself in the robbery-murder of Janice Ott.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">Defendant was returned to the Youth Home. The prosecutor petitioned the probate court to waive jurisdiction so that defendant might be prosecuted as an adult on the charge of first-degree murder. Counsel and a guardian <em>ad litem </em>were appointed for the defendant. Following a hearing on February 15, 1972, the probate court\u2019s decision on the question of waiver was announced on March 6, 1972. The probate court set forth the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>standards upon which it based its decision to waive jurisdiction as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-5\">\"1. Glynn Peters is a fairly large individual for his age. He is now past his 17th birthday. He appears mature. His prior record is extremely bad. It dates back to October 24, 1968 and he has been in Court a considerable number of times since then.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-6\">\"He is an orphan and has been raised in boarding homes, by relatives, etc. He has had attorneys represent him at a considerable number of hearings. He has had previous convictions, using knives in assaults and robberies.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-7\">\"In February 1970 he was committed by this Court to the State Department of Social Services, was placed at the Boys Training School, and became a State ward.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-8\">\"2. The crime with which he is charged is extremely serious. This was not only a robbery with a large knife, but it was committed under circumstances that indicate clearly that he is dangerous.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-9\">\"3. He has a long pattern of repetitive conduct in committing assaults and other offenses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-10\">\"4. There is no suitable program at the juvenile level. He could only be confined until he is 19 years of age and he is now past his 17th birthday.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-11\">\"Attached hereto is a letter signed by Hartford Smith, Jr., Chairman, Parole and Review Board, Office of Youth Services. He indicates very clearly that there is no program at the juvenile level. It should be pointed out that if he is found guilty of this charge, he needs long term confinement. He was a truant from the Training School at the time of this assault.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-12\">\"5. It is certainly in the best interests of the public and Glynn Peters that he stand trial as an adult. The public certainly needs protection from Glynn Peters.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-13\">\"Sometimes the question of waiver presents a very close case. In this case, there is no doubt whatsoever. If found guilty of this charge, Glynn Peters needs long term confinement in a security institution extending years beyond his 19th birthday.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-14\">\"If he were kept at the juvenile level, he could only be confined until he is 19 years of age. He has been in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>juvenile programs for years and none of these programs have done anything to rehabilitate him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-5\">\"At the conclusion of the hearing on February 15, 1972, the matter was referred to the Clinic for Child Study and case was continued to March 6, 1972 with the consent of counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-6\"><em>\u2019\u2019The matter again comes before the Court on March 6, 1972. </em>A report had been submitted by Dr. Schornstein of the Clinic for Child Study in which he agreed with the Parole and Review .Board of the Office of Youth Services. He recommended waiver to Adult Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-7\">\"On March 6, Mr. Goodman, the attorney for Glynn Peters was given an opportunity to submit additional testimony and argument. He is an experienced attorney who had carefully protected the record on a number of matters where he challenged the admissibility of evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-8\">\"The Court stated the reasons for waiver as set forth in this memorandum. Mr. Goodman had a chance to examine and study all the files and records in the case including the Clinic report.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-9\">\"This is a very clear-cut case for waiver. It is not a close decision. Obviously, if found guilty, Glynn Peters needs long term confinement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b468-10\">After preliminary examination in recorder\u2019s court, defendant was bound over for trial on the charge of first-degree felony murder. Thereafter, a motion to suppress defendant\u2019s confession was heard and denied as were motions to suppress a lineup identification and an anticipated in-court identification. A motion was also filed to quash the information on the basis of the alleged unconstitutionality of the waiver statute. This motion was likewise denied without prejudice to refiling after the rehearing of <em>People v Fields, </em>388 Mich 66; 199 NW2d 217 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-11\">On October 26, 1972, defendant appeared in open court and pled guilty to the included offense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>of murder in the second degree. The transcript of the plea proceedings before the late Judge John R. Murphy is set forth at length in the appendix following this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">Defendant was thereafter sentenced to life imprisonment. The Court of Appeals reversed at 56 Mich App 305; 224 NW2d 65 (1974), holding that recorder\u2019s court lacked jurisdiction in the matter by reason of our decisions in <em>People v Fields, supra, </em>adhered to on rehearing, 391 Mich 206; 216 NW2d 51 (1974). We reverse and reinstate defendant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">We note first that in <em>People v Fields, supra, </em>the contested waiver of jurisdiction occurred in 1968, before the adoption of JCR 1969, 11. Therefore, the effect of the standards for waiver set forth in JCR 11 upon the question of lack of standards in the waiver statute was not before the <em>Fields </em>Court. Second, the argument advanced by defendant that this Court could not by court rule constitutionally insure <em>procedural </em>due process in the handling of juvenile waiver proceedings was rejected, at least by implication, even by the majority in <em>Fields </em>on rehearing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-8\">\"While this Court cannot enact substantive laws, it does have the authority to decide upon the procedures to be followed in the courts of this state. Such authority has been exercised by adopting the General Court Rules for courts of general jurisdiction, the District Court Rules for the district courts, and the Juvenile Court Rules. Being fully cognizant of the problems created by the decisions of the United States Supreme Court in <em>Kent, supra </em>[383 US 541; 86 S Ct 1045; 16 L Ed 2d 84 (1966)], and <em>In re Gault, </em>387 US 1; 87 S Ct 1428; 18 L Ed 2d 527 (1967), the Probate Court Committee of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>Court, * * * undertook with the help of the probate judges, to insure <em>procedural </em>due process in the handling of juvenile court cases. Any question pertaining to JCR 1969, 11, is not before the Court in this case since it was not in effect at the time the action of the probate judge herein reviewed took place.\u201d 391 Mich at 215-216.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">Finally, we must express our disagreement with the holding of the majority opinion in <em>Fields </em>on rehearing, and our agreement with the reasoning of dissenting Justice Levin when he stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-6\">\"There was and is no need to declare the waiver of juvenile jurisdiction provision unconstitutional. This Court has ample power, which it has exercised both decisionally and through rule making on countless occasions, to provide adequate standards to guide judges in reaching their decisions, and to make both the hearing process and appellate review meaningful.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-7\">\"The judiciary of this state in establishing waiver criteria both before and after the decision in <em>Kent v United States, </em>383 US 541; 86 S Ct 1045; 16 L Ed 2d 84 (1966), did precisely what judges have been doing for centuries \u2014 filling in gaps in a statute. Especially where power has been delegated to a court, it can frequently find the 'intelligible principle\u2019 in its own jurisprudence and in the decisions of other courts dealing with like problems.\u201d 391 Mich at 239-240. (Footnotes omitted.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-8\">\"While the courts have refused to allow Legislatures to impose nonjudicial functions on them, there is little support for the proposition that a legislative act which confers power on a <em>court </em>is constitutionally deficient because it lacks standards to guide the court in discharging its judicial duty. The standards test is a judicial safeguard against the action of administrative officials and agencies, not against judicial action.\u201d 391 Mich at 244. (Footnote omitted.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>\"The means of protecting juveniles who are improvidently waived to a court, of general criminal jurisdiction is appellate intervention. We can protect against unjustified discrimination in the exercise of the waiver power by encouraging the circuit courts and the Court of Appeals to exercise, and by ourselves exercising, thoughtful review on appeals from orders waiving jurisdiction. This means reading transcripts, weighing the testimony, scrutinizing the reasons advanced for ordering and sustaining the waiver, and, where unconvinced, unhesitating intervention.\u201d 391 Mich at 251-252.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">Our reading of the transcripts and the reasons advanced by the probate court in ordering waiver convinces us that jurisdiction was not improvidently waived and, in fact and as stated by the probate court, \"[t]his is a very clear-cut case for waiver\u201d. To the extent that <em>People v Fields, supra, </em>is not supportive of our decision today, it is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">Defendant argues that (1) the probate court acted in violation of its role of <em>parens patriae </em>when it allowed him to go to police headquarters for evidentiary purposes, (2) that his confession at the conclusion of the polygraph examination would therefore have been inadmissible in a trial of him in adult court, and that (3) his plea of guilty on the advice of counsel to a reduced charge some 10 months later<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> was the product of the allegedly inadmissible confession. He asks us to set aside the plea as involuntary. We need not reach the merits of defendant\u2019s first two contentions in order to reject the third:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>\"[A] guilty plea represents a break in the chain of events which has preceded it in the criminal process. When a criminal defendant has solemnly admitted in open court that he is in fact guilty of the offense with which he is charged, he may not thereafter raise independent claims relating to the deprivation of constitutional rights that occurred prior to the entry of the guilty plea.\u201d <em>Tollett v Henderson, </em>411 US 258, 267; 93 S Ct 1602, 1608; 36 L Ed 2d 235 (1973).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-5\"><em>Tollett </em>reaffirmed the principle recognized in the 1970 <em>Brady </em>trilogy: <em>Brady v United States, </em>397 US 742; 90 S Ct 1463; 25 L Ed 2d 747, <em>McMann v Richardson, </em>397 US 759; 90 S Ct 1441; 25 L Ed 2d 763, <em>Parker v North Carolina, </em>397 US 790; 90 S Ct 1458; 25 L Ed 2d 785. In <em>Parker </em>the Supreme Court rejected the argument that the guilty plea of a 15-year-old youth accused of burglary and rape was the involuntary product of a coerced confession:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-6\">\"[B]ut we need not evaluate the voluntariness of petitioner\u2019s confession since even if the confession should have been found involuntary, we cannot believe that the alleged conduct of the police during the interrogation period was of such a nature or had such enduring effect as to make involuntary a plea of guilty entered over a month later.\u201d 397 US at 796.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">See also <em>People v Morris, </em>57 Mich App 573; 226 NW2d 565 (1975), leave denied 394 Mich 751 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">The same arguments advanced by defendant in this Court in support of his assertion of an involuntary plea were made in the trial court on the motion to suppress. That motion was denied and defendant\u2019s confession as well as other evidence was ruled admissible. On the advice of able counsel, defendant chose not to risk a trial on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>greater charge and the possibility that an appellate court would uphold the trial court\u2019s evidentiary ruling in the event of a conviction. A review of this record convinces us that \"the advice he received was well within the range of competence required of attorneys representing defendants in criminal cases\u201d. <em>Parker, supra, </em>397 US at 797-798. A reading of the plea transcript manifests beyond peradventure that the trial court showed great sensitivity to the seriousness of defendant\u2019s plea and questioned him at length concerning his guilt and the voluntariness of the plea before it was accepted. <em>Parker, supra, </em>397 US at 816 (Brennan, J., concurring in <em>Brady).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b473-3\">The Court of Appeals is reversed.

The police and the Prosecutor claim that on December the 22nd, 1971, that you were in an apartment building at 905 Merton Street in the City of Detroit. They claim that you were armed with a weapon, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>you went there to rob a lady named Janice Ott. That you were robbing her and that during the course of that robbery you killed her and that that killing constituted murder in the first degree.

The Court has asked this defendant. He\u2019s aware of the present charge pending against him. We have conducted an examination in this matter. And we\u2019ve had a motion in the matter. I\u2019ve reviewed the law with him and the facts applicable to that law. I\u2019ve given him the best advice I know how. And based upon that advice it\u2019s his decision to, at this time, withdraw his former plea heretofore, that plea being not guilty. And enter a plea of guilty to the included offense of murder in the second degree. I\u2019ve explained to him the difference between the charge now pending in the complaint and warrant, that charge being first degree murder. And I\u2019ve explained to him that if he was convicted of that charge the court would be duty bound to impose a mandatory life sentence, if he was convicted of the charge as it now exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-8\">However, if he offered a plea to the included offense of second degree murder, the punishment can be any number of years up to and including life. And based upon that difference in <em>[sic] </em>his decision now to offer a plea to the included offense of second degree murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-9\"><em>The Court: </em>Thank you, Mr. Hill.

Mr. Hill could question the witnesses, cross examine the witnesses, he could try to show that those witnesses were making a mistake, or that they were lying or that they didn\u2019t know what they were talking about or that they shouldn\u2019t be believed. And he could ask them any questions that you wanted him to ask also. Do you understand?</p>\n<p id=\"b477-10\"><em>The Defendant: </em>Yes, I do.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-11\"><em>The Court: </em>Okay. After all of the witnesses that the police knew anything about had testified there might be some people that you would want to have come to court. And if you had some witnesses that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>you wanted to come to court and testify in your behalf we would get a subpoena, a court order, and make those people come down here to court, make them get on the witness stand and make them testify, if they had some testimony that was favorable to you. Do you understand that?</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\"><em>The Defendant: </em>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\"><em>The Court: </em>Then there might come a time when you\u2019d want to get up on that witness stand. And if you wanted to you could. But if you didn\u2019t want to testify you wouldn\u2019t have to. And if you didn\u2019t want to say anything nobody could say anything about it. Nobody could tell the jury 'Glynn Peters should have testified.\u2019 Nobody could say to the jury 'how come Peters didn\u2019t testify\u2019. Nobody could say to the jury 'if Peters was innocent he would have testified.\u2019 Nobody could even mention the fact that you didn\u2019t want to testify. Or that you hadn\u2019t testified. Do you understand that?</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\"><em>The Defendant: </em>Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-8\"><em>The Court: </em>Okay. Now, while the trial was going on you\u2019d be sitting there with Mr. Hill and the jury would be able to see you. The jury couldn\u2019t look over there and say 'well, he must have done something or the police wouldn\u2019t have him\u2019. The jury could not say that. Do you understand that?</p>\n<p id=\"b478-9\"><em>The Defendant: </em>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-10\"><em>The Court: </em>The jury, the twelve people on the jury would have to keep in mind this thought. They would have to keep thinking, 'I assume that Glynn Peters didn\u2019t do anything wrong.\u2019 'And I\u2019m going to keep assuming that until after I\u2019ve heard all of the evidence.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b478-11\">Now, what that means is the jury couldn\u2019t even start to think that you might be guilty until after they heard all of the evidence and all of the facts in the case. Understand?</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number><em>The Defendant: </em>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\"><em>The Court: </em>Are you sure?</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\"><em>The Defendant: </em>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\"><em>The Court: </em>Okay, that\u2019s called the presumption of innocence. The jury has to presume that you\u2019re innocent until they hear all the evidence, okay?</p>\n<p id=\"b479-8\"><em>The Defendant: </em>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-9\"><em>The Court: </em>After the jury did hear all the evidence, they\u2019d go into that room there where it says jury (indicating) and twelve of them would talk about the case. Now, those twelve people could not find you guilty unless all twelve of them were completely convinced that you had committed this murder. Do you understand that?</p>\n<p id=\"b479-10\"><em>The Defendant: </em>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-11\"><em>The Court: </em>If one of them had a doubt they could not find you guilty. They would all twelve of them be completely convinced that on December the 22nd you were there on Merton Street in that apartment building. They\u2019d have to be completely convinced that you were there to rob that lady, and they\u2019d have to be completely convinced that she was killed during the course of that robbery. They\u2019d have to be totally convinced about that. Do you understand?</p>\n<p id=\"b479-12\"><em>The Defendant: </em>Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-13\"><em>The Court: </em>Okay. And you know that you would never be alone at that trial, if we had it. Mr. Hill would always be with you. Do you understand that?</p>\n<p id=\"b479-14\"><em>The Defendant: </em>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-15\"><em>The Court: </em>Now, you just heard Mr. Hill tell me that you didn\u2019t want a jury trial. And I tried to explain to you just now what a jury trial is all about. Do you understand everything that I just told you?</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number><em>The Defendant: </em>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\"><em>The Court: </em>Do you want to have the jury trial?</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\"><em>The Defendant: </em>No, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\"><em>The Court: </em>Mr. Hill told me that you want to withdraw your plea of not guilty to the charge of first-degree murder. You know, you\u2019ve pleaded not guilty since your arrest back in December of \u201971.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-8\"><em>The Defendant: </em>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-9\"><em>The Court: </em>He said, Mr. Hill said, that now you want to plead guilty to a lesser charge called second-degree murder. Is that what you want to do?</p>\n<p id=\"b480-10\"><em>The Defendant: </em>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-11\"><em>The Court: </em>Do you understand, Mr. Peters, that if you plead guilty to second-degree murder you might go to prison for the rest of your life?</p>\n<p id=\"b480-12\"><em>The Defendant: </em>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-13\"><em>The Court: </em>All right. And when I talk about a life sentence that means I could start with any number of years. I could start with a sentence that had a forty year minimum or a sixty year minimum or a hundred year minimum. Do you understand that?</p>\n<p id=\"b480-14\"><em>The Defendant: </em>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-15\"><em>The Court: </em>All right or just impose a straight life sentence. Do you understand that?</p>\n<p id=\"b480-16\"><em>The Defendant: </em>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-17\"><em>The Court: </em>Do you know the difference between a first degree murder life sentence and a second degree murder life sentence?</p>\n<p id=\"b480-18\"><em>The Defendant: </em>I think so, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-19\"><em>The Court: </em>First degree murder is you serve life, and that means until you die. And you can\u2019t ever be paroled. Do you understand the difference?</p>\n<p id=\"b480-20\"><em>The Defendant: </em>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number><em>The Court: </em>Did anybody tell you that if you plead guilty you\u2019d get an easy sentence?</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\"><em>The Defendant: </em>No, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\"><em>The Court: </em>Did anybody tell you that what sentence you\u2019d get?</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\"><em>The Defendant: </em>No, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-8\"><em>The Court: </em>Did anybody make you any promises? Or did anybody threaten you? Or did anybody say anything to you to get you to plead guilty?</p>\n<p id=\"b481-9\"><em>The Defendant: </em>No, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-10\"><em>The Court: </em>Has anybody told you that you had to plead guilty?</p>\n<p id=\"b481-11\"><em>The Defendant: </em>No, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-12\"><em>The Court: </em>Is it your decision and yours alone?</p>\n<p id=\"b481-13\"><em>The Defendant: </em>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-14\"><em>The Court: </em>Why do you want to plead guilty, Mr. Peters?</p>\n<p id=\"b481-15\"><em>The Defendant: </em>Because, like, I feel like I\u2019m man enough to stand up for what I did. For what I did wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-16\"><em>The Court: </em>Are you telling me that you are guilty of this crime?</p>\n<p id=\"b481-17\"><em>The Defendant: </em>Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-18\"><em>The Court: </em>Do you remember the day of December the 22nd, 1971?</p>\n<p id=\"b481-19\"><em>The Defendant: </em>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-20\"><em>The Court: </em>Do you know where 905 Merton Street is?</p>\n<p id=\"b481-21\"><em>The Defendant: </em>Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-22\"><em>The Court: </em>Tell me what you did on that day? You tell me what you did on December the 22nd, 1971 on Merton Street?</p>\n<p id=\"b481-23\"><em>The Defendant: </em>Well, like, Christmas was coming up, and, like, I didn\u2019t have nothing, and I wanted to get the family something. So, like, the people that lives in there was in the front room. I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>told them I was going out for awhile. And they said, 'All right.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">So I went towards Six Mile, and then I got on Merton and the lady she drove up and I went past her. And when she went in the parking lot I doubled, came back, and she put her key in the door \u2014 .</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\"><em>The Court: </em>She what? Put her key in the door?</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\"><em>The Defendant: </em>Yes. In the back door. And I went up behind the lady and she ran upstairs, and I went up behind her and I put my arm around her neck and told her to give me the money.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-8\"><em>The Court: </em>Did you have a weapon?</p>\n<p id=\"b482-9\"><em>The Defendant: </em>Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-10\"><em>The Court: </em>What kind of weapon?</p>\n<p id=\"b482-11\"><em>The Defendant: </em>A small kitchen knife.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-12\"><em>The Court: </em>Did you have that out at the time you grabbed her around the neck?</p>\n<p id=\"b482-13\"><em>The Defendant: </em>No.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-14\"><em>The Court: </em>You grabbed her around the neck and you told her to give you the money, right?</p>\n<p id=\"b482-15\"><em>The Defendant: </em>Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-16\"><em>The Court: </em>Then what happened?</p>\n<p id=\"b482-17\"><em>The Defendant: </em>She said, 'All right.\u2019 And then she started screaming, she started backing up, she was going to fight me, I just panicked.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-18\"><em>The Court: </em>And what did you do when you panicked?</p>\n<p id=\"b482-19\"><em>The Defendant: </em>Stabbed her.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-20\"><em>The Court: </em>You got that knife out at some time, right?</p>\n<p id=\"b482-21\"><em>The Defendant: </em>Right.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-22\"><em>The Court: </em>Do you know where it was that you stabbed her? What part of her body?</p>\n<p id=\"b482-23\"><em>The Defendant: </em>In the abdomen, I think.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-24\"><em>The Court: </em>Do you remember how many times?</p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number><em>The Defendant: </em>No.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\"><em>The Court: </em>Then what did you do?</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\"><em>The Defendant: </em>Ran. I threw the knife up on the roof right behind her apartment, and I still had the purse, and I took the money out of the purse and put the purse between two parked cars in the parking lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\"><em>The Court: </em>You did take the money out of the purse?</p>\n<p id=\"b483-8\"><em>The Defendant: </em>Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-9\"><em>The Court: </em>Do you remember how much you got?</p>\n<p id=\"b483-10\"><em>The Defendant: </em>No.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-11\"><em>The Court: </em>And you left the purse between two parked cars?</p>\n<p id=\"b483-12\"><em>The Defendant: </em>Right.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-13\"><em>The Court: </em>Then what did you do?</p>\n<p id=\"b483-14\"><em>The Defendant: </em>Ran home.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-15\"><em>The Court: </em>You were arrested a few days later, weren\u2019t you?
