The Court of Appeals affirmed. Defendant claims the conviction should be reversed because the trial court did not reject certain testimony as hearsay. To the contrary, we find the testimony was properly admitted. The conviction is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>LaTonia Boldin was working as an agent for the Detroit police when defendant was arrested. The controversy concerns her appearance as a witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">In chronological order, the testimony in question was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-7\">(1) Mrs. Boldin went to defendant\u2019s restaurant, telling defendant she wanted a job to support her habit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-8\">(2) When defendant asked when she could start work, Mrs. Boldin answered she could start as soon as she got her head together <em>(i.e., </em>got a fix).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-9\">(3) Defendant <em>asked </em>her what she \"was on\u201d.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-10\">(4) Defendant suggested some \"P\u201d (pure heroin):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-11\"><em>\"A. (Mrs. Boldin): </em>* M He says, 'Well, how about marijuana? I said, 'No.\u2019 I said, 'Because that\u2019s too mild.\u2019 * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-13\">\"He says, 'well, how about some P\u2019s?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-14\">(5) Defendant asked Mrs. Boldin how much money she had, responding that the 20 dollars would be fine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-15\">(6) Defendant told Mrs. Boldin he could get the \"P\u201d for her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-16\"><em>'A. (Mrs. Boldin): </em>* * * and I asked him, I says, 'Well, could you get it for me?\u2019 * * * And he said yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-17\">(7) Defendant then left the restaurant, walking across the street to an apartment building.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-18\">(8) Junior joined Mrs. Boldin while she was waiting in the restaurant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-19\">(9) Defendant returned to the restaurant, walking directly to the kitchen in back of the restaurant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-20\">(10) Defendant called Junior back to the kitchen and they engaged in conversation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-21\">(11) Junior returned and Mrs. Boldin gave him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>20 dollars. Junior passed a packet of heroin to her under the table.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-4\">(12) Defendant emerged, asking Mrs. Boldin, \"Do you think you\u2019ll have yourself together around 3 o\u2019clock?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">In the kitchen, Junior was positioned so that Mrs. Boldin could not see what, if anything, passed to him from defendant, but concert of action can be established by circumstantial evidence. The conversations between defendant and Mrs. Boldin and defendant\u2019s and Junior\u2019s movements comprise sufficient circumstantial evidence, independent of Junior\u2019s conversation, to establish a prima facie<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> case of concert of action.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">Of notable impact is the fact that Mrs. Boldin did not tell Junior of the agreed purchase or price of the heroin, yet after Junior\u2019s return from speaking with defendant, he exchanged the packet of heroin for 20 dollars. Testimony concerning his conversation was not crucial to jury deliberation, although it did add flesh to the bare bones of the transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>In defendant\u2019s absence Junior introduced himself to Mrs. Boldin and asked whether she would be working at the restaurant and if defendant had gone. He asked her if she got high, to which she replied affirmatively. Junior then asked, \"did Stewart go over to the apartment building to get some?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">After defendant returned to the restaurant and had spoken with Junior in the kitchen, Junior sat next to Mrs. Boldin at the counter and allegedly asked,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-7\"><em>\"Q. </em>Do you have any money for me?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-8\"><em>\"A. </em>What?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-9\"><em>\u201dQ. </em>Do you have any money for me? Twenty dollars?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-10\"><em>\u2019A. </em>Yeah.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b109-11\">Junior then told her to slip it up under the counter so no one would see her. She handed him the 20 dollars and he handed her a small tinfoil packet. She asked if that was all she was going to get and Junior replied, \"Yeah, because Howard sells them real mellow P\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-12\">It was then that defendant came out and asked if she would have herself together by 3:00.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-13\">In our opinion, a prima facie case of concert of action was made by the prosecutor, so the conversation with Junior (an unnamed codefendant) comes within a well-established exception to the hearsay rule.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Even without the hearsay, adequate facts to go to the jury were in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-14\">In 1867 Justice Christiancy stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>\"The general rule is well settled that, where several persons are engaged in one common unlawful enterprise, whatever is said or done by any one of them in the prosecution of the common enterprise, or while it is still in progress, is evidence against all the parties to it.\u201d <em>People v Pitcher, </em>15 Mich 397, 403-404 (1867).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">The challenged acts and declarations in this case were during the alleged concerted action, not before or after. A prima facie case of concert of action was established without any of Junior\u2019s declarations. The acts of Junior are not those \"assertive\u201d acts sometimes excluded <em>(e.g., </em>pointing, sign language) nor remote or irrelevant <em>(e.g., </em>collection of insurance as proof of death at sea). To the contrary, Junior\u2019s acts were relevant, immediate and constituted part of the transaction. His only crucial act outside of defendant\u2019s presence was passing the heroin to the witness who had been searched before entering the restaurant and who had the heroin when she emerged. We find no case in which a similar act was excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">The United States Supreme Court has recognized a valid distinction between acts and declarations of co-conspirators. In <em>Lutwak v United States, </em>344 US 604; 73 S Ct 481; 97 L Ed 593 (1953), <em>reh den </em>345 US 919; 73 S Ct 726; 97 L Ed 1352 (1953), the Court approved the use of a co-conspirator\u2019s acts against other members of the conspiracy although the conspiracy had ended. At the same time use of declarations was not allowed. The Court characterized the problem of declarations as one of hearsay:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-8\">\"Therefore, the declarations of a conspirator do not bind the co-conspirator if made after the conspiracy has ended. That is the teaching of <em>Krulewitch v United States </em>[336 US 440; 69 S Ct 716; 93 L Ed 790], and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number><em>Fiswick v United States </em>[329 US 211; 67 S Ct 224; 91 L Ed 196 (1946)]. Those cases dealt only with declarations of one conspirator after the conspiracy had ended. They had no application to <em>acts </em>of a conspirator or others which were relevant to prove the conspiracy. True, there is dictum in <em>Logan v United States </em>[144 US 263, 309; 12 S Ct 617; 36 L Ed 429 (1892)], frequently repeated, which would limit the admissibility of both acts and declarations to the person performing them. This statement of the rule overlooks the fact that the objection to the declarations is that they are hearsay. This reason is not applicable to acts which are not intended to be a means of expression. The <em>acts, </em>being relevant to prove the conspiracy, were admissible, even though they might have occurred after the conspiracy ended. <em>United States v Rubenstein </em>151 F2d 915, 917, 918 [CA 2, 1945]; see <em>Fitzpatrick v United States, </em>178 US 304, 312, 313 [20 S Ct 944; 44 L Ed 1078, 1081, 1082 (1900)]; <em>Ferris v United States </em>40 F2d 837, 839 [CA 9, 1930].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">Similarly, the necessity of proving a prima facie case of conspiracy is a problem arising out of the use of hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">Statements declared by a co-conspirator (or one engaged in a concert of action) are hearsay if used against another member of the conspiracy. But, a widely recognized exception to the hearsay rule allows such use if the conspiracy is properly proven (prima facie) by evidence independent of the hearsay. <em>People v Chambers, </em>279 Mich 73; 271 NW 556 (1937); <em>People v Lewis, </em>264 Mich 83; 249 NW 451 (1933). The rationale is that the agency relation charges each conspirator with declarations and admissions of other co-conspirators. <em>Lutwak v United States, supra. </em>The same follows for certain acts of a co-conspirator. Acts or conduct not intended as assertive are not hearsay and, therefore, they are admissible. It should be noted that nonassertive acts or conduct are not an excep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>tion to the hearsay rule \u2014 rather, they are not hearsay in the first place.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">In view of the circumstances absent Junior\u2019s statement, their safe bounds of relevancy and \"indicia of reliability\u201d,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the trial judge did not err in allowing the testimony about the absent co-defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">In addition, the nonassertive acts of the parties did not constitute hearsay and no error was committed in allowing a description to go to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">We follow long recognized and necessary theories of criminal law as to this set of facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">We affirm the conviction.</p>\n<judges id=\"b112-8\">Williams and Fitzgerald, JJ., concurred with Coleman, J.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b112-9\">Lindemer and Ryan, JJ., took no part in the decision of this case.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b108-7\"> \" 'A \"prima facie\u201d case means, and means no more than, evidence sufficient to justify, but not to compel, an inference of liability, if the jury so find.\u2019 \u201d <em>Stewart v Rudner, </em>349 Mich 459, 474; 84 NW2d 816, 826 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">\"PRIMA FACIE CASE.

The witness was permitted over objection to report certain statements she said were made by \"Junior\u201d which inculpated Stewart. \"Junior\u201d has not been identified.

It does not appear that the people made any effort to produce him at the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\">The Court of Appeals, finding \"evidence, aliunde, of a conspiracy [between Stewart and \"Junior\u201d] to sell heroin\u201d, held that \"Junior\u201d \u2019s statements were admissible under the co-conspirators exception to the hearsay rule and affirmed the convictions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">We would reverse. The statements allegedly made by \"Junior\u201d are not admissible. Evidence aliunde of the commission of a crime and the connection of defendant to the crime cannot consist of hearsay statements or be established by testimony of the sole prosecution witness who would also report the statements allegedly made by defendant\u2019s partner in crime. Additionally, the Confrontation Clause requires at a minimum that the people establish that there is a person known as \"Junior\u201d and that they made a good faith effort to produce him at the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">The people made their case entirely from the testimony of LaTonia Boldin, an unpaid civilian undercover narcotics agent working for the Detroit Police Department.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> She testified that she went to Stewart\u2019s restaurant, introduced herself as \"Candy\u201d, and told him she needed a job to support her_ \"habit\u201d. Stewart asked her when she could begin work, and she said as soon as she got a \"fix\u201d. Stewart first offered her marijuana, which she rejected because it was \"too mild\u201d, and then agreed to sell her \"some P\u2019s\u201d [heroin]<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> for $20.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>Boldin testified that Stewart left the restaurant and entered an apartment building across the street. While he was gone, Boldin talked \"for 10 or 15 minutes\u201d with a man who introduced himself as \"Junior\u201d. During the conversation they discussed narcotics. <footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">Boldin testified that when Stewart returned to the restaurant he went directly to the kitchen and called \"Junior\u201d. She said that she did not see Stewart carrying anything or give anything to \"Junior\u201d.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> She could see that Stewart and \"Junior\u201d were talking, but could not hear what they said.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">Stewart remained in the kitchen. \"Junior\u201d rejoined Boldin and sold her heroin<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> for $20.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-8\">Over objection, Boldin related statements of \"Junior\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-9\">\"He came and he sat next to me at the counter, and he says, 'Do you have any money for me?\u2019 and I said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>\u2018What?\u2019 He said, 'Do you have any money for me?\u2019 And he said, 'Twenty Dollars.\u2019 And I said, 'Yeah.\u2019 * * * And he says, 'Well, don\u2019t put it on top of the counter, slip it up under the counter so no one will see you.\u2019 When I handed him the twenty dollars he handed me a small tinfoil packet about the size of a stamp, and I looked at it, and I says, 'Was this all I\u2019m going to get for twenty dollars?\u2019 And he says, 'Yeah, because Howard sells them real mellow P. * * * And that will give you a real boost high because Howard sells some bad stuff.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">Stewart contends that \"Junior\u201d \u2019s statements, which all agree are hearsay, should not have been admitted into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">Hearsay statements are generally inadmissible. An exception is recognized, however, for declarations<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> of a co-conspirator made in furtherance of and during the pendency of the conspiracy. Such declarations are admissible against the defendant if the existence of the conspiracy and the connection of the defendant to it are established by independent evidence.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>The co-conspirators exception has been extended<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and applied to statements of a co-participant where the charge is commission of the completed offense. Such statements are admissible where there is independent evidence of a concert of action between the declarant and the defendant.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">The Court of Appeals concluded that a concert of action between Stewart and \"Junior\u201d was established by evidence that \" 'Junior\u2019 knew the selling price. He knew who the supposed purchaser was and what she wanted to buy. Since the agent had given only defendant [Stewart] that information, it is reasonable to conclude defendant and 'Junior\u2019 combined to make the illicit sale.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> This rationale misconceives the nature of the precondition to admissibility; other hearsay statements of the declarant, \"Junior\u201d, are not independent evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">This Court takes another tack. Boldin repeated hearsay statements made by Stewart as well as \"Junior\u201d. This Court concludes that a prima facie case of concert of action is established by evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>of \"[t]he conversations between defendant [Stewart] and Mrs. Boldin and defendant\u2019s and 'Junior\u2019 \u2019s movements\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">Stewart\u2019s statements were admitted in evidence. The admissibility of those statements is not in issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-8\">\"Junior\u201d \u2019s statements were admitted over objection. The issue on appeal is the admissibility of \"Junior\u201d \u2019s statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-9\">Neither Stewart\u2019s nor \"Junior\u201d \u2019s statements are admissible without evidence aliunde. The confessions or admissions<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> of an accused are not admissible unless the corpus delicti \u2014 the fact that the charged oifense was committed by someone \u2014 is established by evidence aliunde.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The statements of a co-conspirator or accomplice are not admissible unless both the corpus delicti and defendant\u2019s connection to the conspiracy or participation in the concert of action are established by evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>aliunde. <em>Glasser v United States, </em>315 US 60, 74; 62 S Ct 457; 86 L Ed 680 (1942).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">The people presented only one witness, LaTonia Boldin, in their case in chief. The people sought to satisfy the evidence aliunde requirement entirely through her testimony. Her transaction with \"Junior\u201d would be the corpus delicti, the foundation for admitting Stewart\u2019s statements. Her conversation with Stewart and her testimony regarding the movements of \"Junior\u201d and Stewart would be the basis for admitting \"Junior\u201d \u2019s statements. Apart from Boldin\u2019s testimony, there is no evidence that a crime was committed by anyone or that there was a person known as \"Junior\u201d in Stewart\u2019s restaurant.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">Aliunde means \"[f]rom another source; from elsewhere; from outside\u201d.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">Proof aliunde of the commission of a crime and the connection of the defendant to the crime cannot, consistent with the purpose of the rules requiring independent evidence, be established by the witness who also reports the hearsay statements; it must be adduced \"from another source, from outside\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">Here there is no evidence, apart from the testimony of Boldin, that a crime was committed by anyone. Similarly, all evidence of a concert of action to commit the crime was proffered by Bol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>din. She testified to the extrajudicial statements of both the accused and of his alleged confederate. It stands on end the aliunde requirement to permit such cross-ruffing of the preconditions to admissibility: Stewart\u2019s extrajudicial statements are admitted on the strength of Boldin\u2019s assertion that they were made and the \"independent\u201d evidence of her testimony that she purchased narcotics from \"Junior\u201d; \"Junior\u201d \u2019s extrajudicial statements are admitted on the strength of Boldin\u2019s assertion that they were made and the \"independent\u201d evidence of her testimony regarding Stewart\u2019s statements and the actions of Stewart and \"Junior\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\">If the requirement of proof aliunde is to have meaning the people are obliged to prove the fact that someone committed a crime and that defendant participated in a concert of action to commit it through testimony of a witness other than the witness who testifies to the extrajudicial statements.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">The concern about admitting hearsay evidence relates not only to the credibility of declarants but also the accuracy of the reports of hearsay witnesses.

Since the issue here is whether \"Junior\u201d \u2019s statements are admissible, the nature of the foundation for the admission of Stewart\u2019s statements \u2014 the actions of the declarant himself, \"Junior\u201d \u2014 disqualifies Stewart\u2019s statements from consideration in deciding whether \"Junior\u201d \u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>statements are admissible. To conclude otherwise would in effect allow admission of \"Junior\u201d \u2019s statements based solely on \"Junior\u201d \u2019s actions which all would agree violates the predicate of admissibility under the co-conspirators exception.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">Stewart contends that the introduction into evidence of \"Junior\u201d \u2019s hearsay statements was a denial of his constitutional right of confrontation.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">It is not necessary to disposition to determine whether the admission under the co-conspirators exception of hearsay statements may deny the right to confront one\u2019s accusers.

Since the general hearsay rule excludes only declarations and not acts as evidence, the usual statement of the coconspirator rule as applying to acts as well as to the declarations of a coconspirator is both misleading and incorrect. Because of it, courts have unnecessarily had to 'extend\u2019 the coconspirator rule, either to admit acts offered to establish facts ordinarily difficult to prove, such as intent or motive, or to admit all acts. These problems seem to stem from a failure to separate the question of whether a conspirator is substantively liable for the acts, both verbal and nonverbal, of a coconspirator, from the question of what statements of a coconspirator should be admitted as evidence against the defendant. In the recent case of <em>Lutwak v United States </em>[344 US 604; 73 S Ct 481; 97 L Ed 593 (1953)], the Supreme Court recognized this distinction and held that acts do not fall under the coconspirator rule.\u201d Developments in the Law, <em>Criminal Conspiracy, </em>72 Harv L Rev 920, 988 (1959).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b115-10\"> <em>Logan v United States, </em>144 US 263, 309; 12 S Ct 617; 36 L Ed 429 (1892); <em>Glasser v United States, </em>315 US 60; 62 S Ct 457; 86 L Ed 680 (1942); 4 Wigmore, Evidence (3d ed), \u00a7 1079; Levie, <em>Hearsay and Conspiracy, </em>52 Mich L Rev 1159 (1954).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b116-8\"> Commentators state that co-conspirators\u2019 declarations are admitted out of necessity and not because such evidence is trustworthy or because conspirators are co-agents who are liable for each other\u2019s statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-9\">\"The practical considerations which justify forcing a principal to adopt, for business and evidence purposes, the statements of his authorized agent are not present with a conspiracy, because its members often lack the power to control or authorize other members\u2019 actions.\u201d Regarding the trustworthiness rationale, this commentator states that, \"[t]he conspiracy situation may provide strong motivation to fabricate with regard to the involvement of innocent parties if the claim of their participation would further the group\u2019s ends\u201d.
