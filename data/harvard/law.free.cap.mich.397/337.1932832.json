Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">In November, 1973, the Michigan Asparagus Growers Division of appellee Michigan Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Association, Inc. [MACMA] petitioned defendant Agricultural Marketing and Bargaining Board for a determination of an asparagus bargaining unit under the Michigan Agricultural Marketing and Bargaining Act [henceforth referred to as the Bargaining Act].</p>\n<p id=\"b443-8\">The board made such determination, and subsequently accredited Michigan Asparagus Growers as the sole sales and bargaining representative of the newly created Processing Asparagus Bargaining Unit, over the objection of plaintiff Michigan Canners and Freezers Association.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-9\">Michigan Canners brought an action in Ingham Circuit Court alternatively as a petition for review of a final decision of an administrative agency under the Administrative Procedures Act, MCLA 24.201 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 3.560(101) <em>et seq., </em>and as an original action seeking an injunction and declaratory ruling on the unconstitutionality and con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>struction of the Agricultural Marketing and Bargaining Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">The circuit court dismissed this action, ruling that under \u00a7 5(2) of the Bargaining Act, all board action requires review in the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">Moreover, the circuit court explicitly declined to exercise its \"equitable jurisdiction\u201d to examine the constitutionality of the act. The court so ruled because it did not want to establish a bifurcated review procedure in which constitutional issues would be before the circuit court while all other issues were before the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">In May of 1974, plaintiff filed for leave to appeal and a claim of appeal with the Court of Appeals. Both were denied in October, 1974.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">Michigan Canners subsequently applied to this Court for leave to appeal the dismissals by the circuit court and the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">Prior to granting of leave to appeal by this Court, Michigan Canners filed a petition for review in the Court of Appeals under \u00a7 5(2) of the Bargaining Act seeking a review of the constitutionality of the act and the procedures followed by the board in accrediting the Michigan Asparagus Growers Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-9\">MACMA moved to stay Court of Appeals proceedings pending decision by this Court on the application for leave to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-10\">This Court granted leave on January 15, 1975.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-11\">II. Remanding Constitutional Challenge to Circuit Court</p>\n<p id=\"b444-12\">As mentioned above, plaintiff has raised important questions regarding the constitutionality and construction of the Agricultural Marketing and Bargaining Act without developing a factual rec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>ord at trial which would help provide a context in which to consider these questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\">To resolve these significant issues in such a factual vacuum would be imprudent where it appears that further factual development would substantially contribute to the proper disposition of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">Such is the case here, especially in that Michigan Canners has claimed that the Bargaining Act is unconstitutional because it exceeds the police power of the state. This claim in particular requires full development of facts which might support or undermine the claim that the statute is an invalid exercise of the police power.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">The police power, an attribute of state sovereignty, may be properly exercised through regulations which tend to foster the health, order, convenience and comfort of the people and to prevent and punish injuries and offenses to the public. It has as its object the preservation and/or improvement of social and economic conditions affecting the community at large. Such power is elastic in nature, changing shape as varying social conditions demand correction. <em>People v Sell, </em>310 Mich 305, 315-316; 17 NW2d 193 (1945); <em>People v Brazee, </em>183 Mich 259, 262; 149 NW 1053 (1914). <em>People v Raub, </em>9 Mich App 114, 119; 155 NW2d 878 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">As a matter of law, the party challenging the act carries the burden of overcoming the presumption of constitutionality which accrues to the statute. <em>Irishman\u2019s Lot, Inc. v Secretary of State, </em>338 Mich 662, 667; 62 NW2d 668 (1954); <em>Thayer v Dept of Agriculture, </em>323 Mich 403, 410; 35 NW2d 360 (1949). To overcome this presumption, plaintiff must show either that there is no public purpose to be served by the statute, or that there is no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>reasonable relationship between the remedy adopted by the Legislature and the public purpose. <em>Grocers Dairy Co v Dept of Agriculture, </em>377 Mich 71, 75; 138 NW2d 767 (1966); <em>Carolene Products Co v Thomson, </em>276 Mich 172, 178; 267 NW 608 (1936).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">As a practical matter, we ask both parties to contribute to the development of a factual context which will allow us to properly resolve the issue of the constitutionality of the act under the principles outlined above. What are the conditions in the farming and food processing industry which led to the enactment of the act? Is there an imbalance in the bargaining power of the growers and the handlers? If so, what are the consequences of that imbalance? Is the number of farmers in Michigan declining? Is the acreage of land devoted to farming on the decrease? Is there reason for concern about food supply in the future? Is there a trend toward larger farms, to the detriment of the small farmer, which might adversely affect the community at large? How will the operation of the act be beneficial or detrimental to producers, processors and consumers in the short run, and in the long run?</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">If any of the potential problems suggested above do exist, is there any evidence that the remedies embodied in the Bargaining Act are or are not reasonably related to the purpose of alleviating the problem(s)?</p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">Defendant MACMA questions the appropriateness of the circuit court as a forum for the presentation of these issues given the language of \u00a7 5(2) of the Bargaining Act, MCLA 290.705(2); MSA 12.94(105X2), providing in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-9\">\"Any person aggrieved by a final order of the board granting or denying in whole or in part the relief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>sought may obtain a review of an order in the court of appeals, by filing in the court a written petition requesting that the order of the board be modified or set aside.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b447-4\">However, it is well established that a litigant challenging the constitutionality of a statute and seeking injunctive relief is not necessarily required to follow the appellate procedure provided for in the statute challenged. <em>Diggs v State Board of Embalmers &amp; Funeral </em>Directors, 321 Mich 508, 513; 32 NW2d 728 (1948); <em>Asta v Department of Revenue, </em>338 Mich 505, 511; 61 NW2d 608 (1953); <em>Smigel v Southgate Community School District, </em>388 Mich 531, 557; 202 NW2d 305 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">We remand to the circuit court so that evidence relevant to these questions, and other questions related to the constitutionality of the Bargaining Act, may be received by that court.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">III. Applicability op APA to Accreditation Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">Plaintiff asserts that the Administrative Procedures Act, MCLA 24.201 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 3.560(101), <em>et seq., </em>is applicable to the Bargaining Act, that the board failed to comply with the requirements of APA.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-8\">Defendant MACMA disputes the applicability of APA to the Bargaining Act, and asserts that the circuit court is not the proper forum for consideration of this issue under \u00a7 5(2). There has been no hearing on the merits of this issue in the courts below.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-9\">While the Court of Appeals no doubt has subject matter jurisdiction over this matter of construction, so also does the circuit court. Section 5(2) provides for original jurisdiction in the Court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>Appeals only for review of final orders of the Agricultural and Marketing Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">However, the issue of the applicability of the APA to the Bargaining Act is not limited to the validity of a particular order, but rather involves a broad question of construction of the statute itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">Therefore, there is no reason why plaintiff should not be allowed to raise this question before the circuit court on remand along with the constitutional issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">IV. Validity of the Declaration of Accreditation</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">The circuit court may not, however, consider plaintiff-appellant\u2019s challenge to the validity of the declaration of accreditation of the Michigan Asparagus Growers on the merits for the Legislature has dictated in \u00a7 5(2) of the Bargaining Act, MCLA 290.705(2); MSA 12.94G05X2),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that the Court of Appeals has original jurisdiction over such an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-8\">Plaintiff-appellant asserts that the accreditation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>is invalid in that it is not based on substantial evidence of compliance with \u00a7 7 of the act,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> as is required by \u00a7 5(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\">It is further argued that such a claim may be heard by the circuit court because the declaration of accreditation is not an \"order\u201d, as that term is used in \u00a7 5(2), which must be reviewed by the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>We disagree with the claim that the declaration of accreditation is not an order under \u00a7 5(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">In the first instance, we find it difficult to understand plaintiffs saying that \u00a7 5(2) applies to accreditation in establishing a requirement of substantial evidence in Court of Appeals review, and yet, does not apply to accreditation in establishing original jurisdiction in the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">Moreover, an examination of the statute does not support plaintiff\u2019s claim that the Legislature intended to establish a bifurcated review procedure for actions of the board in which dispositions regarding unfair practices under the act are \"orders\u201d to be reviewed by the Court of Appeals, while dispositions regarding accreditation are \"determinations\u201d to be reviewed in the circuit court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">First, it should be noted that what is being challenged here is not merely a determination, but rather a \"declaration of accreditation\u201d which is issued after the board has determined that an association should be accredited.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> While this declaration is not termed an \"order\u201d specifically, it functions as a binding order 30 days after publica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>tion, absent a challenge to the declaration meeting the requirements of \u00a7 10(2) of the act.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\">Furthermore, the use of the word \"determination\u201d throughout the act does not suggest, as plaintiff-appellant claims, that the Legislature had carefully chosen this word to inferentially create a bifurcated review system in which the accreditations of bargaining associations are to be reviewed in a forum different from all other actions of the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">The word \"determination\u201d is used with neither great precision nor consistency. In \u00a7 9, for example, the words determination and finding are used interchangeably for no apparent reason. In subsection (1), the Legislature used the words \"determine\u201d and \"determination\u201d, while in subsection (2), there is a shift to the word \"finding\u201d, though it is apparent that no change in meaning was intended.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>In \u00a7 16, which deals with arbitration procedure, the word \"determine\u201d is used interchangeably with the word \"find\u201d and the word \"determination\u201d is used interchangeably with the word \"finding\u201d, again, for no apparent reason.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">Moreover, the wording \"finding\u201d seems to be equivalent in this section to an order under \u00a7 5(2), for it is said that \"This finding [of a reasonable quantity] shall be enforced in accordance with the provisions of section 5\u201d. MCLA 290.716(1); MSA 12.94(116X1).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">Such word usage does not suggest that the Legislature intended to establish a strict distinction between orders and determinations under \u00a7 5(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>The bifurcated system of review which plaintiff-appellant argues for would create unnecessary inconvenience and expense for parties disputing actions of the board, and we decline to conclude that the Legislature intended such without stronger indications of such intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">V. Conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">We remand to the circuit court for consideration of the questions of the constitutionality of the Agricultural Marketing and Bargaining Act, and the applicability of the Administrative Procedures Act to accreditation proceedings under the Bargaining Act. We retain appellate jurisdiction over the other issues presented in this case, and will consider those issues, along with the questions hereby remanded to the circuit court, subsequent to the disposition by the circuit court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b453-6\">Kavanagh, C.

The board shall exclude from that quantity any quantity of the agricultural commodity contracted by producers with producer owned and controlled processing cooperatives and any quantity produced by handlers. An association whose main purpose is bargaining but which processes a surplus into a form which is not the subject of bargaining is not a processing cooperative. The contracts with members shall specify the agricultural commodity and that the members have appointed the association as their exclusive agent in negotiations with handlers for prices and other terms of trade with respect to the sale and marketing of the agricultural commodity and obligate them to dispose of their production or holdings of the agricultural commodity through or at the direction of the association.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-10\">(d) The association has established and authorized a marketing and bargaining committee to negotiate with handlers for the agricultural commodity.

They are protected from the unfair practices of handlers. MCLA 290.704(1); MSA 12.94(104)(1). They are prohibited from committing unfair practices against handlers. MCLA 290.704(2); MSA 12.94(104)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">The board may receive complaints. If it \"consid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>ers that there is reasonable cause to believe that a person charged has committed a practice in violation of this act\u201d, the board must hold a hearing. MCLA 290.704(3); MSA 12.94(104X3). If \"a preponderance of the evidence\u201d shows a violation, the board \"shall issue * * * an order requiring him to cease the violation and shall order further affirmative action as will effectuate the policies of this act\u201d. MCLA 290.704(4); MSA 12.94(104X4).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">The Legislature selected the Court of Appeals as the forum to review the board action. The board \"may petition the court of appeals for the enforcement of its orders, and for appropriate temporary relief or restraining order\u201d. MCLA 290.705(1); MSA 12.94(105X1). This gives the court \"jurisdiction of the proceeding and of the question determined\u201d. It \"may grant temporary relief or restraining order as it deems just and proper\u201d. It may enforce, modify or set aside the board\u2019s order. Anyone aggrieved by the board\u2019s final order may obtain a similar review. MCLA 290.705(2); MSA 12.94(105)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">Unfair practices involve coercion, intimidation, conspiracy and acts disrupting the normal handling of perishable commodities. The board is obliged to hold a hearing, make a record and state its findings of fact which are conclusive \"if supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole\u201d. The Court of Appeals may order the taking of additional evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">Unfair practice complaints demand prompt action to prevent damage to crops and to defuse explosive situations. The Legisl\u00e1ture gave the board authority to order that violations cease. The board may order that affirmative actions be taken. Its role in those situations differs greatly from the accreditation process. In the absence of a clear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>legislative directive, the review procedure provided for unfair practice cases should not be applied to accreditation.</p>\n<judges id=\"b457-4\">Fitzgerald, J., concurred with Coleman, J.</judges>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">\n<em>ORDER</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">Entered November 1, 1976. \u2014 Reporter.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">On order of the Court, the motion for clarification of opinion is considered, and the same is granted.
