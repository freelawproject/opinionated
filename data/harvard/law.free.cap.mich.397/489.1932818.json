This is by no means an easy task.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As Justice Brennan admitted in calling for the adoption of the same transaction test, \"the phrase 'same transaction\u2019 is not self-defining\u201d. <em>Ashe v Swenson, </em>397 US 436, 454, fn 8; 90 S Ct 1189; 25 L Ed 2d 469 (1970) (Brennan, J., concurring). However, the task can be accomplished in such a way that the constitutional rights of the criminal defendant will be protected without reaching anomalous or absurd results.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">In this opinion we will explore the purposes behind the adoption of the same transaction test, examine how other jurisdictions have developed the concept of the same transaction, set forth criteria for determining whether crimes arise out of the same transaction and apply that standard to the facts of the four cases before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">I \u2014 Purpose Behind Adoption of Same Transaction Test</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">In seeking to establish the proper parameters of the same transaction test we must be mindful of the purposes behind adopting the rule. We expressed the view in <em>White </em>that the use of the same transaction test would promote both \"the best interests of justice arid sound judicial administration\u201d. 390 Mich 258. Indeed, economical and expeditious administration of justice will result from use of this test, but as we emphasized in <em>White, </em>\"our primary objective in adopting the same transaction test is to ensure that a criminal defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>receives meaningful protection under the double jeopardy clause\u201d. 390 Mich 258, fn 6.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-6\">\"A far more basic reason for adopting the same transaction test is to prevent harassment of a defendant. The joining of all charges arising out of the same criminal episode at one trial ' * * * will enable a defendant to consider the matter closed and save the costs of redundant litigation.\u2019 It will also help ' * * * to equalize the adversary capabilities of grossly unequal litigants\u2019 and prevent prosecutorial sentence shopping. 'In doing so, it recognizes that the prohibition of double jeopardy is for the defendant\u2019s protection.\u2019 41 Mich App 370, 378; 200 NW2d 326, 330 (1972).\u201d 390 Mich 258-259.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">It is the protection of the defendant from the possibility of prosecutorial harassment which was foremost in our minds when we adopted the same transaction test<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and this is the principle which must be kept in mind as we give substance to the phrase, the same transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>II \u2014 Same Transaction \u2014 Intent Crimes\u2014 <em>White </em>Applies</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\"><em>White </em>dealt with a series of offenses all of which involved crimes where criminal intent was an element of the crime. In <em>White, </em>this Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-6\">\"[T]here can be no doubt that the three crimes committed by defendant were all part of a single criminal transaction. The <em>crimes were committed in a continuous time sequence and display a single intent and goal </em>\u2014sexual intercourse with complainant.\u201d (Emphasis added.) 390 Mich 245, 259.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">This was the criterion that case established:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-8\">\"a continuous time sequence and display [of] a single intent and goal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b601-9\">This criterion provides a generally workable test to apply in most instances to determine whether a single transaction exists vis-\u00e1-vis double jeopardy if all the activities involve crimes where <em>criminal intent </em>is an element. We accept that as the criterion which must be applied in all cases where only <em>intent </em>crimes are in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-10\">Ill \u2014 Same Transaction \u2014 No-Intent Crimes</p>\n<p id=\"b601-11\">Where a series of offenses involve either no intent crimes or intent and no-intent crimes, the criterion in <em>White </em>does not provide a wholly workable test. The cases with which this opinion deals involve such fact situations. Our task therefore is to formulate an appropriate criterion to test them in the spirit of <em>White.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>The American Law Institute Model Penal Code seeks to prevent successive prosecutions where offenses are part of the same criminal episode. Section 1.07(2) (Proposed Official Draft, 1962) provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-6\">\"A defendant shall not be subject to separate trials for multiple offenses based on the same conduct or arising from the same criminal episode, if such offenses are known to the appropriate prosecuting officer at the time of the commencement of the first trial and are within the jurisdiction of a single court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">In <em>Commonwealth v Campana, </em>452 Pa 233, 253; 304 A2d 432 (1973), the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, citing the Model Penal Code with approval, held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-8\">\"The Double Jeopardy Clause requires a prosecutor to bring, in a single proceeding, all known charges against a defendant arising from a 'single criminal episode.\u2019 \u201d (Footnote omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b602-9\">The <em>White </em>quotation used above in part I makes use of the term \"criminal episode\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-10\">\"The joining of all charges arising out of the same criminal episode ' * * * will enable a defendant to consider the matter closed and save the cost of redundant litigation.\u2019 \u201d 290 Mich 259.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b602-11\">Utilization of this term therefore will comport with language already employed in <em>White.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b602-12\">Both Hawaii and New York have an approach to the problem at hand that suggests another useful criterion. In <em>State v Ahuna, </em>52 Hawaii 321, 326; 474 P2d 704, 707 (1970), the Supreme Court of Hawaii held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>\"We think that a satisfactory approach to the problem is set forth in \u00a7 111 of the proposed Hawaii Penal Code 1970. Under the approach a former prosecution, although it has been for a violation of a different statutory provision, will bar a subsequent prosecution if the subsequent prosecution is for an offense based on the same conduct, unless the offense 'requires proof of a fact not required by the former offense and the law defining each of the offenses is intended to prevent a substantially different harm or evil.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">A New York criminal statute likewise provides that subsequent prosecutions will not be barred where \"the offenses * * * [contain] an element which is not an element of the other, and the statutory provisions defining such offenses are designed to prevent very different kinds of harm or evil\u201d. NY Crim Pro L \u00a7 40.20(2)(b) (McKinney 1971).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">A common criterion in both these jurisdictions is that the same transaction rule applied where the offenses involve laws intended to prevent the same or similar harm or evil, not \"a substantially different harm or evil\u201d (Hawaii), or \"very different kinds of harm or evil\u201d (New York).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">Drawing upon these sources certain criteria for determining whether crimes arise out of the same transaction can be set forth.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-8\">1) Where criminal intent is required in the offenses involved, the criterion set forth in <em>White </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>applies: \"continuous time sequence and display [of] a single intent and goal.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">2) Where one or more of the offenses does not involve criminal intent, the criterion is whether the offenses are part of the same criminal episode, and whether the offenses involve laws intended to prevent the same or similar harm or evil, not a substantially different, or a very different kind of, harm or evil.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">The above criteria do not purport to be all-inclusive. Criteria could no doubt be fashioned to encompass a greater number of fact situations and perhaps offer more guidance and thereby promote to a greater degree the efficient administration of justice. However, we believe that the criteria set forth today are as broad as appropriate until we are called upon to consider further illustrative cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">IV \u2014 Application of the Standard</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">The task remains to determine whether the individual offenses involved in each of the four cases before us arise out of the same transaction. Each of the four cases include either traffic or liquor law violations. Such offenses do not require <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>criminal intent as an element and consequently, part (1) of the standard dealing with the singleness of the criminal intent or goal is inapplicable. The relevant portion of the standard for the cases before us is part (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">A. <em>Crampton</em></p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">On May 13, 1972, Clyde Crampton was arrested in Lansing and charged with driving under the influence of liquor, MCLA 257.625; MSA 9.2325. The complaint alleging that charge was filed in 54-A District Court on May 16, 1972. Subsequently, on June 28, a separate complaint charging Cramp-ton with failure to display a valid registration on demand, MCLA 257.223; MSA 9.1923, was also filed in the district court. It is clear that this second complaint was also based on the May 13 arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">Faced with the two complaints, Mr. Crampton entered a guilty plea to the failure to display registration charge on October 25, 1972. On November 6, Crampton moved to quash the driving under the influence of liquor charge by arguing that the same transaction rationale barred any further prosecution. The district court held that the same transaction rule did not apply and the circuit court affirmed. The Court of Appeals denied leave and we granted leave on September 4, 1974, 392 Mich 793 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-8\">So <em>Crampton </em>poses the question whether the offenses of DUIL and inability to display a valid registration are part of the same transaction. Since they are not intent offenses we employ the second criterion \"whether the offenses are part of the same criminal episode, and whether the offenses involve laws intended to prevent the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>or similar harm or evil, not a substantially different, or a very different kind of, harm or evil\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">Were DUIL and inability to display a valid registration part of the same criminal episode? Nothing indicates these two offenses were part of the same criminal episode. DUIL appears merely to have been the occasion of exposing the inability to display a valid registration.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">Furthermore, the harm or evil intended to be prevented by the DUIL law and the law requiring ability to display a valid registration are substantially different. The former is to protect the travelling public against danger from drivers not in full control of themselves. The latter is to protect against the theft of automobiles.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">In short, the two offenses in <em>Crampton </em>are not part of the same transaction under our second criterion. The guilty plea to the failure to display a registration charge therefore was not a bar to suit on DUIL. The circuit court and the district court holdings were therefore correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">B. <em>Hudgins</em></p>\n<p id=\"b606-8\">Royce Daniel Hudgins was arrested on October 5, 1973, and charged with three offenses all detected at one point in time: making an improper U-turn (Detroit ordinances, \u00a7 38-5-7); driving an automobile emitting excessive smoke (Detroit ordinances, \u00a7 38-10-11); and carrying a pistol in a motor vehicle without a license (MCLA 750.227; MSA 28.424). On April 25, 1974, before the scheduled date of his trial on the two ordinance charges, Mr. Hudgins entered a guilty plea in the Traffic and Ordinance Division of Recorder\u2019s Court to the improper U-turn and excessive exhaust smoke charges. He was convicted and fined by the court. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>The same day, he moved in recorder\u2019s court to dismiss the gun charge, arguing that the same transaction rule barred any further prosecution. The trial judge agreed and dismissed the charge. The people appeal on bypass granted by this Court, 393 Mich 774 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\"><em>Hudgins </em>poses the question whether making an improper U-turn or operating a vehicle which emits excessive smoke and carrying a pistol in a motor vehicle are part of the same transaction. Since making an improper U-turn and operating a vehicle which emits excessive smoke are non-intent offenses, we again employ the second criterion of our test, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">First, we find that the only connection between the offenses of making an improper U-turn or excessive smoke emission and carrying a weapon was that the arrest resulting from the traffic violations was the occasion for discovering that Hudgins was carrying a pistol in the vehicle. As with <em>Crampton, </em>such a connection is not sufficient to establish that these offenses were part of the same criminal episode.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">Secondly, the harm or evil intended to be prevented by the improper U-turn law, the excessive smoke emission law and the law prohibiting the carrying of weapons are substantially different. The law which prohibits improper U-turns is designed to promote the flow of traffic and safety conditions on certain designated roadways. The law prohibiting excessive smoke emission is designed to prevent polluting the air. Neither of these offenses involves laws intended to prevent the same or similar harm or, evil sought to be prevented by the law prohibiting carrying a pistol in a motor vehicle, namely, to promote public peace and safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>Therefore, the traffic offenses and the crime of carrying a pistol in a motor vehicle were not part of the same transaction under our second criterion. The trial court was in error in its ruling that the prosecution on the gun charge was barred by the same transaction rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">C. <em>Jones</em></p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">On February 17, 1974, Jones was arrested in a raid of an alleged \"blind pig\u201d in the City of Detroit. Three separate charges were filed against him: disorderly conduct (Detroit ordinances, \u00a7 39-1-10); possession of heroin (MCLA 335.341[4] [a]; MSA 18.1070[41] [4] [a]); and possession of marijuana (MCLA 335.341[4] [d]; MSA 18.1070 [41] [4] [d]). Approximately one month later, on March 15, 1974, Mr. Jones was found guilty by a referee in the Traffic and Ordinance Division of Recorder\u2019s Court on the disorderly conduct charge. A fine of $100 was imposed. Subsequently, on July 8, 1974, Mr. Jones moved to dismiss the two remaining charges by arguing that the same transaction test applied to this case. The trial judge granted the motion and the people appealed on bypass granted by this Court, 393 Mich 794 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-8\">Since disorderly conduct is a non-intent offense, we employ the second criterion of our test. First, as in the case of <em>Crampton </em>and <em>Hudgins, </em>the only connection between the disorderly conduct offense and the offenses of possession of heroin and marijuana was that the arrest for disorderly conduct was the occasion for the discovery of the additional possession of heroin and marijuana offenses. Such a connection is insufficient to establish that these offenses were part of the same criminal episode.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-9\">Secondly, the purpose of the disorderly conduct ordinance is to prevent unlawful civil disturbance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>while the purpose of the laws prohibiting the possession of marijuana and heroin is to ultimately prohibit the use of physically harmful substances. Clearly, the ordinance prohibiting disorderly conduct was intended to prevent a substantially different harm or evil from the laws prohibiting possession of marijuana or heroin.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">Therefore, the disorderly conduct offense and the crime of possession of marijuana and heroin were not part of the same transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">The trial court was in error in its ruling that prosecution of the possession of marijuana and heroin offenses was barred because of the same transaction rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">D. <em>Allen</em></p>\n<p id=\"b609-8\">On September 29, 1973, James Allen, Jr., was arrested and charged with driving under the influence of liquor (MCLA 257.625; MSA 9.2325); felonious assault (MCLA 750.82; MSA 28.277), and carrying a concealed weapon (MCLA 750.227; MSA 28.424). All offenses are alleged to have occurred at the scene of an automobile accident in which Allen was involved. On November 26, 1973, Allen stood trial in the Trafile and Ordinance Division of Recorder\u2019s Court on the DUIL charge. He was convicted and sentenced by the court to 45 days at the Detroit House of Correction. On February 6, 1974, he moved in recorder\u2019s court for the dismissal of the two remaining charges. The trial judge found that the same transaction test applied and accordingly dismissed the charges. The people appeal on bypass granted by this Court, 393 Mich 775 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-9\">Since DUIL is a non-intent offense, we once again employ the second criterion of our test. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>this particular case we must apply the second criterion to (1) whether DUIL and carrying a concealed weapon are part of the same transaction and (2) whether DUIL and felonious assault are part of the same transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">As for DUIL and carrying a concealed weapon, we find that these two offenses are not part of the same transaction. First, we find that these offenses are not part of the same criminal episode. The only connection between DUIL and carrying a concealed weapon in this case is that arrest for the DUIL violation was the occasion for the discovery of the concealed weapon. As we have seen in <em>Crampton, Hudgins, </em>and <em>Jones, </em>this is not a sufficient link to establish that these offenses were part of the same criminal episode. Secondly, we find that the harm or evil intended to be prevented by the DUIL law and the law prohibiting the carrying of a concealed weapon are substantially different. The purpose of the DUIL law, as we noted in our discussion of <em>Crampton, </em>is to protect the travelling public against danger from drivers not in full control of themselves. The purpose of the law prohibiting carrying a concealed weapon is to promote public peace and safety. So, clearly, these offenses involve laws intended to prevent substantially different harm or evil. Therefore, the trial court was in error in ruling that DUIL and carrying a concealed weapon were part of the same transaction, thus barring prosecution on the concealed weapon offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">As for DUIL and felonious assault, we find that these two offenses are also not part of the same transaction. It is a close question whether the DUIL offense and the felonious assault offense in this case were part of the same criminal episode. However, we need not make this determination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>because, applying the other part of the test, we find that the DUIL and felonious assault laws were intended to prevent substantially different kinds of harm or evil. We have already reiterated the purpose of the DUIL law: to protect the travelling public against danger from drivers not in full control of themselves. The purpose of the felonious assault law is to protect the public from physical violence and harm. Therefore, the trial court was also in error when it concluded DUIL and felonious assault were part of the same transaction. Prosecution on the felonious assault charge was not barred under the same transaction rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">IV \u2014 Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">Under the standard adopted today for determining whether offenses arose out of the same transaction, we conclude that in none of the four cases should subsequent prosecutions be barred.

The Court of Appeals held that defendant\u2019s \"acquittal of murder for the events arising out of this single, criminal episode of robbery, kidnapping, rape and murder bars further prosecution by the state\u201d. Similarly, in <em>People v Joines (On Remand), </em>55 Mich App 334; 222 NW2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>230 (1974), where the defendant was acquitted on a charge of kidnapping in Genesee County, the Court of Appeals reversed his subsequent Livingston County conviction of assault with intent to rape the victim of the kidnapping.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">In <em>People v Davenport (On Remand), </em>51 Mich App 484; 215 NW2d 702 (1974), and <em>People v West, </em>54 Mich App 527, 530; 221 NW2d 179 (1974), following trial for disorderly conduct,* <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the defendants were convicted in circuit court of resisting arrest<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>(Davenport) </em>and resisting and obstructing an officer in discharge of his duty<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>(West). </em>In <em>West </em>the Court of Appeals said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-6\">\"As in <em>People v White, supra, </em>and <em>Davenport, </em>the two crimes with which defendant was charged were committed in a continuous time sequence, and plaintiff conceded in its brief and at oral argument that both charges arose out of the same transaction. * * * As in <em>Davenport, </em>the continuousness of the time sequence was obvious, and the unity of intent was also apparent \u2014the defendant\u2019s refusal to submit to the police officers\u2019 authority.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">In <em>People v Martinez, </em>58 Mich App 693, 695; 228 NW2d 523 (1975), the defendant was convicted in one proceeding of possession of heroin on February 20, 1973 and in a separate proceeding of possession of heroin on March 1, 1973 as the result of transactions with the same police undercover agent. In affirming defendant\u2019s second conviction, the Court of Appeals said that while the deliveries of heroin were \"to the same agent during the course of a continuous undercover investigation * * * these facts alone do not relate the events intimately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>enough so as to characterize them as being a part of a single transaction under the test adopted in <em>People v White. </em>* * * [T]he record does not disclose any connection between [the two sales], such as an agreement after the first delivery to return for another sale.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">In <em>People v Goans, </em>59 Mich App 294, 297; 229 NW2d 422 (1975), the defendant was charged with felonious driving<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and pled guilty to an added charge of failure to stop at a motor vehicle accident involving property damage.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals held that a plea of guilty to one of two counts of a multi-count information does not preclude proceeding on other counts where the defendant enters a plea \"with the full awareness that the prosecutor intends to proceed to trial on the other charge.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> See <em>Genesee Prosecutor v Genesee Circuit Judge, </em>391 Mich 115; 215 NW2d 145 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">In <em>People v Williams, </em>61 Mich App 642, 646; 233 NW2d 122 (1975), the defendant entered a plea of guilty to breaking and entering an occupied dwelling. Subsequently a person the defendant assaulted in the dwelling died of his injuries. The Court of Appeals, referring to an exception noted in footnote 6 of <em>White, </em>held \"that since the crime with which defendant was here charged was not complete at the time of his earlier plea, his conviction is not barred by double jeopardy\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">In <em>People v Jackson, </em>391 Mich 323, 342; 217 NW2d 22 (1974), the defendant was arrested when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>he sought to use a credit card stolen, during the course of an attempt to rob a bar, from a person in the bar. This Court held that defendant\u2019s plea of guilty to the offense of attempted unlawful possession of a credit card<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> did not bar prosecution for assault with intent to rob being armed.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> While the credit card charge was related to the attempted robbery charge in the sense that the credit card was stolen during that attempt, these were separate transactions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-5\">\"The Double Jeopardy Clause does not license subsequent offenses growing out of a theft or excuse the theft upon trial for one or another offense.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">The <em>Jackson </em>analysis was adopted in <em>People v Charles Johnson, </em>62 Mich App 240, 249; 233 NW2d 246 (1975), where, following a prison escape, the defendant forced a woman at knifepoint to accompany him while they drove in her automobile. The defendant was convicted of prison escape<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and subsequently was convicted of assault with intent to commit a felony.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals declared that \"the double jeopardy clause does not license subsequent offenses growing out of a prison escape or excuse the escape upon trial of one or another offense\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b616-8\">In <em>White, Joines, Davenport </em>and <em>West, </em>there were both a continuous time sequence and a com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>mon goal or intent \u2014 sexual intercourse with the victim <em>(White </em>and <em>Joines) </em>or refusal to submit to the police officers\u2019 authority <em>(Davenport </em>and <em>West). </em>In <em>Rolston, </em>a common goal or intent did not appear, but there was a substantial connection in criminality between the offenses committed. Robbery of the bar escalated to kidnapping of the barmaid and culminated in her rape and murder. There was but one criminal episode and all the offenses were part of the same criminal transaction.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">In contrast, in Martinez, the two sales of heroin were nine days apart and there was no connection between the sales. There were two criminal episodes, two separate criminal transactions. In <em>Jackson, </em>while the attempt to use the credit card was made possible by its theft during the attempt to rob the bar, the chain of criminality was broken when Jackson secured his departure from the bar; there was no substantial connection in criminality between the credit card offense and the offenses committed in the bar. Similarly, in <em>Johnson, </em>the defendant had made good his escape from Jackson State Prison and had traveled a considerable distance before he encountered the woman in Livingston County. While Johnson was still fleeing and the subsequent offense against \"the woman was made possible by the prison escape, the chain of criminality was broken some time between escape from the prison and his encounter with the woman; the police were not in hot pursuit, there was no continuing course of criminality such as victimization of a hostage which might connect the prison escape with the assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">In the instant cases it does not appear there is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>substantial connection in criminality between the traffic or liquor law offenses of which the defendants were convicted and the other offenses they seek to have dismissed.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">Crampton\u2019s arrest for driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor was but the occasion for discovering his inability to display a valid registration,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> as Hudgins\u2019 arrest for making an improper U-turn and excessive smoke emission was the occasion for discovering that he was carrying a pistol in a motor vehicle without a license, and Allen\u2019s arrest for driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor was the occasion for discovering that he was carrying a concealed weapon. Similarly, Jones\u2019 arrest for being in a blind pig was but the occasion for discovering his possession of heroin and marijuana; it does not appear that Jones acquired the heroin or the marijuana in the blind pig. There is no substantial connection in criminality between offenses where the only factor connecting one offense with the other is that one was discovered in consequence of apprehension for the other; each is a separate transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">Criminal intent is not an element of traffic or liquor law violation. However, conscious wrongdoing, <em>mens rea, </em>must be shown to establish the offenses of carrying a concealed weapon, possession of prohibited substances or felonious assault.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>While safety and revenue measures are sometimes enforced with penal sanctions, the interests thereby secured, the harm caused by their violation, is of a nature significantly different than in the case of laws designed to protect persons and property from predatory behavior. We need not attempt to anticipate the myriad situations that may arise or fill in the ground between the two broad groups of offenses. In <em>Allen, </em>there is no substantial connection in criminality between drunk driving and felonious assault with a handgun; each is a separate transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">In the necessary accommodation of the constitutional right not to be placed twice in jeopardy for the same offense and the provisions of statutory and local law<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> establishing the jurisdiction of the district court<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> and the Recorder\u2019s Court of the City of Detroit, Traffic and Ordinance Division,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> preservation of the constitutional right without impairment of full enforcement of the laws requires th\u00e1t we hold that where necessary to accommodate those objectives a prosecutor may file an informar tion in circuit court or recorder\u2019s court for all offenses, whether arising under state or local law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>and whether misdemeanors or felonies, which are part of the same transaction.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">In <em>Crampton </em>the district court is. affirmed.

Therefore, all offenses must be contained in one information and set for trial in one jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-10\">Although my colleagues offer stop-gap solutions, they do not approach the fundamental problem. A sound constitutional protection has been strained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>beyond reasonable accommodation to jurisprudential limits.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">The wisdom of former Justice Brennan\u2019s dissent in <em>White </em>is made more apparent by the resultant legal snarls, some of which we now address. Justice Brennan said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-6\">\"My disagreement with the majority lies not in the objective* of curbing prosecutorial discretion. <em>It is, rather, with the logic of the route chosen to achieve the objective.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-7\">\" <em>While I would support an amendment to the court rules mandating joinder of related offenses, </em>I would affirm the conviction at bar, the same having been obtained in accordance with the procedural rules extant at the time of the proceedings below.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b621-8\">It is the \"route chosen to achieve the objective\u201d in <em>White </em>that has led to the rationalization deemed necessary to avoid absurd results.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-9\">Ostensibly, the majority in <em>White </em>sought to curb prosecutorial harrassment of defendants by eliminating <em>seriatim </em>prosecutions. However, the Court could have achieved this objective through an amendment<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to the court rules mandating joinder of related offenses as Justice Brennan advocated in his dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-10\">Because mandatory joinder does not rise to the dignity of a rule of constitutional law, the Court could carve out exceptions to the rule and permit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>severance of counts for trial without arbitrarily-determining that a rule of constitutional law is inapplicable to certain crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">Every desirable practice need not rest upon further expansion of our elastic constitution which, if it can be interpreted to encompass everything, may eventually mean nothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">I concur in affirming the district court in <em>Cramp-ton. </em>I also concur in reversing recorder\u2019s court and remanding for trial in <em>Hudgins, Allen </em>and <em>Jones.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b621-11\"> Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 5 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-12\">\"The supreme court shall by general rules establish, modify, amend and simplify the practice and procedure in all courts of this state * * * .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b621-13\">In <em>Buscaino v Rhodes, </em>385 Mich 474, 478\u2014479; 189 NW2d 202 (1971), we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-14\">\"We have recognized that art 6, \u00a7 5, Michigan Constitution of 1963, and its predecessors, must be liberally construed in order to aid in the efficient administration of our judicial system.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
