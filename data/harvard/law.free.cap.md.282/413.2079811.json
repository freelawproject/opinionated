In two companion cases presenting this issue, which are before us in one record, the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County ordered payment of the fees only to be reversed by the Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>of Special Appeals in <em>Prince George\u2019s Co. v. Feissner, </em>37 Md. App. 124, 377 A. 2d 1185 (1977). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">Appellant served as attorney for individual claimants in two unrelated workmen\u2019s compensation proceedings which led ultimately to this appeal. In both cases brought against Prince George\u2019s County (the County), as employer and self-insurer, the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Commission of Maryland (the Commission) found the claimant permanently and totally disabled, ordering payment of compensation at the rate of $96.80 a week not to exceed the sum of $45,000. Subsequently, the Commission awarded appellant an attorney\u2019s fee of $5,659 in one case and the sum of $6,100 in the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">The present controversy arose when the County refused to pay either the compensation award or the attorney\u2019s fees.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After orders for compensation benefits and attorney\u2019s fees had been entered by the Commission, the County invoked the offset provisions of Maryland Code (1957, 1964 Repl. Vol., 1977 Cum. Supp.) Art. 101, \u00a7 33 (c) and (d), which provides:<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-7\"><em>\u201c(c) </em>Whenever by statute, charter, ordinances, resolution, regulation or policy adopted thereunder, whether as part of a pension system or otherwise, any benefit or benefits are furnished employees of employers covered under \u00a7 21 (a) (2) of this article, the dependents and others entitled to benefits under this article as a result of the death of such employees, the benefit or benefits when furnished by the employer shall satisfy and discharge pro tanto or in full as the case may be, the liability or obligation of the employer and the Subsequent Injury Fund for any benefit under this article. If any benefits so furnished are less than those provided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>for in this article the employer or the Subsequent Injury Fund, or both shall furnish the additional benefit as will make up the difference between the benefit furnished and the similar benefit required in this article.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-5\">\u201c(d) The Commission may determine whether any benefit provided by the employer is equal to or better than any benefit provided for in this article, and to render an award against the employers or the subsequent injury fund, or both to furnish additional benefit or benefits to make up the difference between the benefit furnished by the employers and the benefits required by this article as the case may be. This section is also subject to the continuing powers and jurisdiction of the Commission provided for in this article.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">Noting that each claimant was entitled to disability retirement pay which exceeded even the maximum workmen\u2019s compensation awarded him by the Commission, the County contended that the compensation claims had been satisfied by the more generous pension benefits and disclaimed all responsibility for payment of the claimants\u2019 attorney\u2019s fees. The Commission found in each case, there being no contrary assertion by the claimant, that the benefits provided by the employer as disability retirement were at least equal to those available under the workmen\u2019s compensation laws of this state. Thus the compensation award in each case was offset by the retirement benefits. In one case, however, the Commission ruled that appellant\u2019s right to collect counsel fees was abrogated by the total offset of the compensation award, but allowed collection of the fee in the second case. The County declined to pay either fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">Confronted with the County\u2019s refusal to pay the fee initially awarded him in both cases, appellant filed two actions at law in the circuit court. Both efforts were successful. In each instance the court held that the offset provisions of \u00a7 33 did not extend to the fees awarded the claimant\u2019s attorney. The court held, in effect, that a statutory attorney\u2019s lien had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>attached upon issuance of the original orders and that once this lien had fastened, the employer was obligated to retain sufficient funds for payment even if the compensation award itself had been discharged by operation of \u00a7 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">In reversing, the Court of Special Appeals held that application of the offset provisions not only extinguished the compensation award granted the claimants, but also precluded creation of a lien upon those benefits for the payment of legal fees. As the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-6\">\u201cWhen the Commission passed its orders approving the attorney\u2019s fees, the County had no compensation liability to either of the claimants to which a lien could attach. Therefore, there was no lien. As we have pointed out, the County had no obligation to pay the fee out of its own funds, unless it ignored a valid lien.\u201d 37 Md. App. at 139.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">The payment of fees for legal services rendered to claimants in workmen\u2019s compensation cases is regulated by \u00a7 57 of Article 101, which, in relevant part, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-8\">\u201cNo person shall charge or collect any compensation for legal services in connection with any claims arising under this article, or for services or treatment rendered or supplies furnished pursuant to \u00a7 37 of this article, unless the same be approved by the Commission. <em>When so approved, such fee or claims shall become a lien upon the compensation awarded, </em>but shall be paid therefrom only in the manner fixed by the Commission. Upon application of any party in interest, the Commission shall have full power to hear and determine any and all questions which may arise concerning legal services rendered in connection with any claim under this article and may order any attorney or other person receiving the same, to refund to the person paying the same, any portion of any charge for legal services which the Commission may, in its discretion, deem excessive.\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b438-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>Unlike its counterparts in several states, \u00a7 57 does not treat attorney\u2019s fees as an \u201cadd-on\u201d or \u201cdouble\u201d benefit which the employer must pay injured employees in addition to the compensation award itself. <em>See generally </em>3 A. Larson, <em>The Law of Workmen\u2019s Compensation </em>\u00a7\u00a7 83.11 and 83.12 (1976). As Judge Digges said for the Court in <em>Chanticleer Skyline Rm. v. Greer, </em>271 Md. 693, 700, 319 A. 2d 802 (1974), <em>aff\u2019g </em>19 Md. App. 100, 309 A. 2d 638 (1973):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-5\">\u201cThe code does not mandate, as the petitioners contend, that there be two <em>separate </em>awards payable by the employer and its insurer, one to the attorney, and another to the employee. Instead, a single award of compensation is made____\u201d (emphasis in original).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">The <em>Chanticleer </em>cases conclusively settle the proposition that under the Maryland statutory scheme, the payment of legal fees does not become an independent obligation of the employer or his insurer, but instead remains at all times the personal responsibility of the claimant. Thus legal fees are not among the enumerated benefits available to the claimant from his employer under the workmen\u2019s compensation laws of this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">Nevertheless, since workmen\u2019s compensation benefits are calculated to provide only minimum wage-loss protection during the period of disability, a serious risk exists that the purpose of the compensation award will be frustrated if benefits are exhausted by payment of excessive legal fees. Consequently, the primary function of \u00a7 57 is to protect against this possibility by authorizing the Commission to adopt appropriate safeguards.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> To secure payment of a reasonable fee to the attorney, on the other hand, and to minimize intrusion into the otherwise private relationship between attorney and client, the statute imposes a lien upon the compensation award for the amount of the fee. This lien, however, does not represent a statutory right in the attorney to reniuneration for legal services, but merely places a charge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>upon the compensation award as security for the legal fee owed by the claimant and approved by the Commission. <em>See Westinghouse v. State Tax Comm., </em>206 Md. 392, 402, 111 A. 2d 661 (1955). Thus, as appellant correctly argues, the lien attaches when the fee is approved by the Commission, but the money to be paid the attorney remains part of the fund to which the employee is entitled as compensation. Liability for payment of counsel fees continues to rest with the employee. Since the employer remains obligated to pay the compensation award from which the fee is to be paid, he may, in part, fulfill his responsibility to the claimant by paying the employee\u2019s debt to the attorney. The statutory lien merely alters the manner in which the employer discharges his liability for the compensation award.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-5\">\u201cThus it is clear that an employer-insurer\u2019s payment of counsel fees simultaneously serves two purposes. It discharges the claimant\u2019s debt to his attorney for services rendered in obtaining the . award and concurrently it discharges the employer-insurer\u2019s obligation to the claimant for the payment of compensation.\u201d <em>Chanticleer Skyline Room v. Greer, </em>19 Md. App. at 106-107.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">Echoing the view propounded by Professor Larson, appellant contends that a claimant\u2019s legal fees \u201cshould be based on the facts [existing] as of the time the services were rendered, and should not be at the mercy of subsequent or collateral events over which he has no control.\u201d 3 A. Larson, <em>Law of Workmen's Compensation </em>\u00a7 83.13 (1976). In support of this contention, appellant relies mainly on decisions from Kentucky and New Jersey. In <em>Elkhorn Stone Company v. Webb, </em>478 S.W.2d 720 (Ky. 1972), the claimant who had been awarded permanent total compensation subsequently died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, the effect of which was to preclude the payment of benefits to his dependents. A few days later, his attorney requested a fee for \u201c20 percent of the award\u201d made to the deceased claimant, which was granted by the compensation board and upheld by the Kentucky Court of Appeals. Central to the court\u2019s decision was a statute which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>provided, in effect, that \u201cthe right to the fee becomes vested when the award is made, and is not affected by subsequent events that may reduce the award____\u201d 478 S.W.2d at 720.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">In <em>Raves v. County of Middlesex-Roosevelt Hospital, </em>102 N.J. Super. 179, 245 A. 2d 536, 539 (1968), an employee who was injured by the negligence of a third person brought a tort action which was settled for $4,000 prior to a hearing on the workmen\u2019s compensation claim. The total workmen\u2019s compensation benefits for which the employer was responsible amounted to $3,335, of which it was required to pay only $1,074 to the claimant after receiving certain credits. Based on this latter sum, rather than on the full compensation award, the claimant\u2019s attorney was granted a fee of only $210. On appeal the New Jersey court, interpreting applicable state law, held that the fee should have been computed on the entire award.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">The result in each of the above cases was predicated upon the operation of a statute which either expressly or impliedly preserved the right to counsel fees even when the compensation award was subsequently nullified. In neither case was the court called upon to examine the interplay, as we are here, between statutes governing payment of legal fees in workmen\u2019s compensation cases and those providing for the offset of pension benefits where the claimant is also a public employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">We recently considered the offset provisions of \u00a7 33 in <em>Mazor v. State, Dep't of Correction, </em>279 Md. 355, 369 A. 2d 82 (1977), <em>aff\u2019g </em>30 Md. App. 394, 352 A. 2d 918 (1976); see <em>also Nooe v. City of Baltimore, </em>28 Md. App. 348, 345 A. 2d 134 (1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>276 Md. 748 (1976). In <em>Mazor, </em>taking note of the fact that a majority of American jurisdictions provide for some form of setoff in the area of wage-loss legislation, we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-8\">\u201c[Wjorkmen\u2019s compensation is one facet of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"?\">*?</page-number>overall system \u00abf wag#fc&gt;3 potodto, \u00aead.,. febea underlying principle of the system is fes i?@ofe\u00abg to fete worker a portion of wages lost by physical disability, unemployment, or old age. It follows that although two or more causes of wage loss may eomeld\u00ae, the benefits need not cumulate, for the worker experiences but one wage loss.\u201d 279 Md. at 868 (citation omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b441-4\">As we observed earlier, the Commission found m this ease \u2014 without any dissent from appellant \u2014 that the pension disability benefits provided by the County were even more favorable than the maximum award rendered in the workmen\u2019s compensation case. In such instances, \u00a7 83 mandates that the pension disability benefits \u201cshall satisfy and discharge\u201d in full \u201cthe liability or obligation of the employer for <em>any </em>benefit under this article,\u201d meaning \u201cany benefit\u201d payable under the workmen\u2019s compensation laws of this state, (emphasis added). Thus, the effect of \u00a7 88 is to prevent the rendition of a compensation award altogether, whenever state or municipal disability benefits exceed those available under Article 101. While the Commission, pursuant to the dictates of the offset statute, must initially make a determination as to the amount and nature of workmen\u2019s compensation benefits to which a claimant would be entitled in the absence of collateral pension payments, this evaluation does not in and of itself constitute an award of compensation within the contemplation of \u00a7 57 and out of which a lien for counsel fees could be satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">We therefore hold that because the offset provision operates to satisfy and discharge in full the workmen\u2019s compensation liability of the employer, there comes into existence no fund on which the attorney\u2019s lien authorised by \u00a7 57 can attach or from which payment of legal fees can be compelled. The consequence is that the employer is discharged of any possible liability under the workmen\u2019s compensation laws for those legal services. Since appellant posits his case solely on the premise that he was entitled to obtain payment of his fees from the County under the workmen\u2019s compensation statutes, the Court of Special <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>Appeals was entirely correct in overturning the two decisions of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">Conceivably, our holding here may, as appellant warns, impair the ability of public employees to obtain legal representation in prosecuting their claims for benefits under the workmen\u2019s compensation laws. However sympathetic we may be to this argument, we are nevertheless bound by the plain and unambiguous language of \u00a7\u00a7 33 and 57.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed; appellant to pay-costs.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b435-8\">. In actuality one of the claimants had already received payments totaling almost $15,000 \u2014 one-third of the entire award \u2014 before Prince George\u2019s County asserted its refusal to pay further compensation benefits or any counsel fees. Appellant concedes, however, that these payments are of no significance and that they do not affect the issue to be decided here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b435-9\">. Save for minor changes in style and form, the offset provisions presently contained in Maryland Code (1957, 1964 Repl. Vol., 1977 Cum. Supp.) Art. 101, \u00a7 88 (c) and (d) are identical to those which governed the workmen\u2019s compensation claims from which this dispute arose.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b438-8\">. See Rule 22 of the Rules of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Commission; and see Statement of Policy for Approval of Attorneys\u2019 Fees by Workmen\u2019s Compensation Commission (Oct. 20, 1970), reprinted in M. Pressman, <em>Workmen\u2019s Compensation in Maryland </em>571 (2d ed. 1977).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b440-9\">. Despite the absence of an express statutory provision, a similar result was reached in Hoffman v. Liberty Mutual, 232 Md. 51, 56, 191 A. 2d 575 (1963), where this Court held that an insurer who had placed the full amount of an approved fee in escrow to satisfy the attorney\u2019s statutory lien was obligated, <em>under principles of estoppel, </em>to pay the entire fee notwithstanding a subsequent reduction of the compensation award on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
