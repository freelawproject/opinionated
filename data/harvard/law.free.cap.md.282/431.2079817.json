City of Balto., </em>278 Md. 356, 364 A. 2d 55 (1976):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-11\">\u201cIn May, 1974, the [Mayor and City Council of Baltimore (the City)] entered into a contract with American Structures, Inc. (the Contractor) for the construction of a storm drain outfall, in accordance with the specifications prepared by the Maryland <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>State Highway Administration (the Highway Administration).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-5\">\u201cWork commenced in September, 1974, and thereafter the Contractor encountered subsurface conditions which allegedly differed substantially from those contemplated by the contract documents. Apparently in reliance on a provision of contract documents which required the giving of prompt notice should conditions be identified which increased the character of the work to be performed under the contract, the Contractor, in January, 1975, notified the City that it was confronted with such a situation. The City apparently directed the Contractor to proceed with the work.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-6\">\u201cWhen negotiations looking toward an adjustment of the contract price proved inconclusive, in September, 1975, the Contractor brought a declaratory judgment action in the Circuit Court of Baltimore City against the City and the Highway Administration, which had as its purpose the construction of the contract provisions. Both defendants interposed the defense of sovereign immunity, the City by a motion to dismiss, and the State by a motion raising preliminary objection. From an order dismissing the action, the Contractor has appealed.\u201d <em>Id </em>at 358.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">We determined that \u201cmunicipalities and counties have been regularly subject to suit in contract actions, whether the contracts were made in performance of a governmental or proprietary function, as long as the execution of the contract was within the power of the governmental unit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 359-360. We concluded \u201cthat on the record before it the trial court was quite correct when it granted the State\u2019s motion raising a preliminary objection, but that the City\u2019s motion to dismiss should have been denied.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 360. Affirming the order in part and reversing it in part, we remanded the case for further proceedings. <em>Id. </em>at 361.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">Fidelity and Deposit Company of Maryland (the Surety), a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>corporation authorized to serve as a compensated surety, executed a bond required by the City as a condition to the award of the contract. The Contractor ceased work under the contract on 1 June 1976, and formal default by it and notification to the Surety occurred on 26 June 1976. On 1 September the Surety filed a petition in equity in the Circuit Court of Baltimore City (the action was subsequently transferred to the law side, Superior Court of Baltimore City) for a declaratory judgment and other relief (the Suit) against the Contractor, the City, James H. Graves and Ellen Graves, his wife, and Louis Tabor and Aline Tabor, his wife (the Indemnitors), and three representative claimants under the bond for work done and materials provided for the project (the Claimants). The City filed a third party claim against Ballard-Diver Joint Venture (Ballard-Divex*), which had allegedly performed design engineering services relating to the project for the City, seeking indemnity for all \u201csums that may be adjudged due to (the Surety).\u201d Ballard-Diver demurred to the third party claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">Count One of the Suit sought, in essence, a determination with respect to the validity of the opposing contentions of the Contractor as principal and the City as obligee, and the rights and obligations of the Surety based on each determination. Count Two sought an interpretation of the surety bond in the light of the \u201cLittle Miller Act,\u201d (the Act), now codified as Maryland Code (1974, 1977 Cum. Supp.) \u00a7 9-113 of the Real Property Article. With respect to Count Two, the Surety filed a motion for partial summary judgment and for declaration of rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">On 22 June 1977 the trial court sustained the demurrer of Ballard-Diver without leave to amend and granted the Surety\u2019s motion. On 11 July the City wrote the court requesting clarification of the order with regard to claims of sub-contractors. On 18 July the court replied that its order of 22 June was correct and \u201caccordingly should stand.\u201d It set out its reasons for so ruling. On 21 July the City noted an appeal from the order of 22 June. Of course, the order of 22 June was not immediately appealable unless the trial court, in accordance with Maryland Rule 606 a, expressly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>determined that there was no just reason for delay and expressly directed the entry of final judgment. <em>Tedrow v. Ford Motor Co., </em>260 Md. 142, 144, 271 A. 2d 688 (1970); <em>Harkins v. August, </em>251 Md. 108, 110-111, 246 A. 2d 268 (1968). The City ultimately realized this and on 3 August filed a motion for the entry of a final judgment as required by Rule 605 a. The court, \u201cupon an express determination ... that there is no just reason for delay in appealing the ruling of the Court of June 22, 1977,\u201d ordered \u201cthat final judgment be entered granting the Motion of Fidelity and Deposit Company of Maryland for partial summary judgment and declaration of rights as stated in the Ruling of the Court dated June 22, 1977.\u201d The City thereupon again noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. We granted a writ of certiorari before decision by that court.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">Ballard-Diver moved in its brief to dismiss the appeal from that part of the order of 22 June 1977 which sustained its demurrer without leave to amend. Maryland Rule 1035 b 1 and 1036 d. It is manifest that the order of 3 August, issued to permit the appeal as contemplated by Rule 605 a, did not contain an express direction for the entry of final judgment in favor of Ballard-Diver, but dealt only with the Surety\u2019s partial summary judgment and declaration of rights. Therefore, that part of the order affecting Ballard-Diver remained interlocutory, and the City\u2019s appeal therefrom was premature. <em>Harkins v. August, supra. </em>We grant Ballard-Diver\u2019s motion and dismiss the appeal as to that appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b456-8\">For almost two decades it has been the statutory requirement that before any contract exceeding $5,000 for the construction of any public work of any city is awarded to any person, he shall furnish to the city the following bonds which shall become binding upon the award of the contract:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-9\">\u201c(1) A performance bond executed by a surety <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>company authorized to do business in this State satisfactory to the public body awarding the contract, and in such amount as it shall deem adequate, for the protection of the public body.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-6\">\u201c(2) A payment bond executed by a surety company authorized to do business in this State satisfactory to the public body for the protection of all persons supplying labor and materials to the contractor [the person awarded the contract] or his subcontractor in the prosecution of the work provided for in the contract for the use of each such person. The bond shall be in the amount not less than fifty per centum (50%) of the total amount payable by the terms of the contract.\u201d Maryland Code (1957, 1964 Repl. Vol.) Art. 90, \u00a7 11 (a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">The required bonds shall be payable to the City and shall be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>approved by its attorney as to form. Code (1974, 1977 Cum. Supp.) \u00a7 9-113 (e) of the Real Property Article.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">We pointed out in <em>State Hwy. Adm. v. Transamerica Ins., </em>278 Md. 690, 697, 367 A. 2d 509 (1976), quoting <em>Montgomery County v. Glassman, </em>245 Md. 192, 201, 225 A. 2d 448 (1967) and citing <em>Hamilton v. Board of Education, </em>233 Md. 196, 200, 195 A. 2d 710 (1963), that the purpose of the payment bond, based on the statute, is to protect subcontractors and materialmen on public projects where they have no lien on the work done. We observed in <em>Transamerica, </em>at 697, that the purpose of the performance bond, in the words of the statute, \u201c \u2018is for the protection of the public body,\u2019 \u201d here, the City. \u201cIts statutory object is to assure the construction and completion of the work contracted for. That is, the purpose of the performance bond, as its name implies, is to secure to the [City] the performance of the contract for the construction of the public work.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">Only one bond was executed with respect to the contract here. The Surety\u2019s allegation in its petition for declaratory judgment that it executed the bond \u201crequired by and drafted by the City and included in its bid proposal, which bond was to be executed as a condition to the awarding of the contract...\u201d was admitted by the City in its answer.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>The bond bound the Contractor, as principal, and the Surety, as surety, unto the City in \u201cthe full and just sum\u201d of $5,346,278, the amount of the contract price for the project. The bond obligated the Contractor to \u201cwell and truly perform, fulfill and comply in all respects the undertakings, covenants, terms, conditions and agreements\u201d of the contract for the construction of the project. The City was indemnified and saved harmless</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-5\">\u201cagainst and from all costs, expenses, damages, injury or loss to which the [City] may be subjected by reason of any wrongdoing, misconduct, want of care or skill, negligence or default upon the part of the said [Contractor] or in any manner arising directly or indirectly from any and all causes whatsoever, in or about the execution or performance of the Contract....\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">The bond provided that the Contractor</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-7\">\u201cshall promptly settle, pay, and satisfy, all claims, demands, and suits made or instituted against the said [Contractor] by any and all persons, firms and/or corporations for the nonpayment of labor performed in and about the work to be done under the Contract for which the said [Contractor] is liable, including any and all extra work that may become part of the Contract, for all material furnished, installed, erected and incorporated in said work for which the said [Contractor] is liable, and shall save and keep harmless the said [City] against and from all losses to it from any cause whatsoever ... in the matter of construction of all the aforementioned____\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b459-8\">If this all was done, then the obligation was void; otherwise it remained \u201cin full force and virtue at law.\u201d The bond concluded with a proviso:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-9\">\u201cIT IS PROVIDED HOWEVER, That no person, firm and/or corporation other than the said [City] shall have any right, title or interest in, to and/or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>under this instrument until and after the said [City] shall have been fully paid and/or reimbursed for any and all costs, expenses, damages and/or losses of every kind, nature and description sustained by it or which may be sustained by it and as to which it is or may be entitled to indemnification under the terms of this instrument.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">Why the City, in the face of the Act, drafted, approved and included this document with its bid proposals instead of clearly complying with the statute is difficult to comprehend. The surety apparently executed the document because the City had approved it as the bond to be furnished with the bid. In any event, it became binding upon the award of the contract, and upon default in the contract by the Contractor the parties inevitably became at odds as to their rights and obligations under it vis-a-vis the statutory prescriptions.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">The Surety and the City agree that the bond here was intended to comply with the Act. They also agree that, therefore, it is to be construed as imposing the obligations established by the Act. This is in accord with the view expressed by this Court in <em>Westinghouse Electric v. Minnix, </em>259 Md. 305, 316, 269 A. 2d 580 (1970) in which we said that the following statement in <em>City of Charles City v. Rasmussen, </em>210 Iowa 841, 847, 232 N. W. 137 (1930) reflected our thinking:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-7\">\u201cThe bond in this case is a statutory bond, and the liability of the parties to the bond must be measured by the statute and not the wording of the bond * * *. We have said repeatedly that any addition to such bond will be treated as surplusage, and any omission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>of the provisions of the statute will be read into the bond.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b461-4\">Thus, the bond here is to be construed as comprising both a performance bond and a payment bond. The issue is what is its coverage, respectively, as a performance bond and as a payment bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">In granting the Surety\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment and declaration of rights as to Count Two of the declaration, the court first found that \u201cthe total liability of [the Surety] on the bond in question was and is $5,346,278.00, the bond on its face binding [the Surety] 'in the <em>full </em>and just sum of Five Million, three hundred forty-six thousand, two hundred seventy-eight ($5,346,278.00) dollars.\u2019 (emphasis added).\u201d We agree. \u201c[T]he liability of a surety upon his bond is dependent upon his covenants and agreements, or, in other words, that an ordinary conventional bond is a simple contract____\u201d <em>Women\u2019s Hospital v. Fid. &amp; Guar. Co., </em>177 Md. 615, 619, 11 A. 2d 457, 459 (1940). \u201cThe cardinal rule in the interpretation of bonds, as in the interpretation of all written contracts, is to ascertain the intention of the parties and to give effect to that intention if it can be done consistently with legal principles.\u201d <em>Levy v. Glens Falls Indem. Co., </em>210 Md. 265, 273, 123 A. 2d 348 (1956). \u201cIt is elementary that a surety on a bond is bound only to the extent and under the circumstances stipulated in the obligation.\u201d <em>Levy </em>at 271. \u201cNothing can be clearer, both upon principle and authority, than the doctrine, that the liability of a surety is not to be extended, by implication, beyond the terms of his contract. To the extent, and in the manner, and under the circumstances pointed out in his obligation, he is bound, and no farther.\u201d <em>Miller v. Stewart, </em>9 Wheat. 680, 702-703, 6 L. Ed. 189 (1824), quoted in <em>Art. Etc. Corp. v. Fidelity Con. Corp., </em>194 Md. 110, 116, 69 A. 2d 808 (1949). <em>See Transamerica Ins., </em>278 Md. at 700; <em>Duffy v. Buena Vista Ice Co., </em>122 Md. 275, 277-278, 90 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>A. 53 (1914); <em>Booth v. Irving Nat. Exch. </em>Bank, 116 Md. 668, 672, 82 A. 652 (1911).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">There is no statute authorizing the penalty of the bond to be in excess of that specified therein. The Act requires that the payment bond shall be in the amount not less than 50% of the total amount payable by the terms of the contract. \u00a7 9-113 (a) (2). The amount of the performance bond shall be such as the public body awarding the contract shall'deem adequate for its protection. \u00a7 9-113 (a) (1). The City suggests that its charter establishes what it had deemed to be adequate for its protection. Charter of Balto. City (1964), Art. VI, \u00a7 4 (g), as amended by Res. No. 5 (1968), ratified 3 November 1970, deals with the contracting for the construction of any public work for the City. A bid for such project in the amount of $5,000 or more shall be accompanied by a certified check, a bank cashier\u2019s check or a bank treasurer\u2019s check of the bidder upon some clearing house bank in an amount provided by ordinance or by the bid specifications or by an order or regulation of the municipal agency for whose use the bids are made and the contract entered into. \u201cThe successful bidder shall promptly execute a formal contract to be approved as to its form, terms and conditions by the City Solicitor, and such bidder shall also execute and deliver to the Mayor a good and sufficient bond to be approved by the Mayor <em>in the amount of the contract price. \u201d </em>(Emphasis added).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It follows, the City claims, that the performance aspect of the bond must be in the amount of the contract price, in this case, $5,346,278. By this reasoning the total obligation of the Contractor and the Surety could be $8,019,417. In other words, the liability of the principal and surety to the City would be the amount of the damages for failure to perform the contract up to $5,346,278 and the liability to the person supplying labor and materials would be the amount due such persons up to a total of $2,673,139.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>We reject this notion of the City. It is clear that under <em>Minnix, supra, </em>the absolute priority of the City, spelled out in the proviso of the bond, is surplusage. By the mandate of the Act, \u201cnot less than fifty per centum (50%) of the total amount payable by the terms of the contract,\u201d must be for the protection of all persons supplying labor and materials to the contractor or his subcontractor in the prosecution of the work provided for in the contract. <em>Minnix </em>teaches that this requirement of the Act shall be read into the bond. The consequence is that the bond here must be interpreted as providing that not less than $2,673,139 shall be allocated as a payment bond, as that sum is 50% of the contract price. The City Charter does not refer to a performance bond and a payment bond. The bond here was in an amount equal to the contract price and, thus, in that regard, complied with the Charter provision. There was nothing inconsistent with the penalty stated in the bond and the Charter. We observe that if there were a conflict between the Charter and the public general law, the public general law prevails. <em>Wilson v. Bd. of Sup. of Elections, </em>273 Md. 296, 301, 328 A. 2d 305 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">Having determined that the total liability under the bond could not exceed $5,346,278, the trial court interpreted the bond in light of the Act:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-6\">\u201cSince this was a statutory bond required by Real Property Article, Section 9-112 (now 9-113), the amount of the total bond apportioned to the payment bond cannot be less than fifty percent (50%) of the contract price, here $2,673,139.00, which amount cannot be subject to any condition purporting to give the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore priority over the persons furnishing labor and materials, the Little Miller Act having been enacted to protect that class of persons. The difference between the total liability of Fidelity and Deposit Company of Maryland ($5,346,278.00) and the amount required by statute as a payment bond ($2,678,139.00) is the amount of the performance bond ($2,673,139.00), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>over which amount the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore can claim priority for any losses incurred under the contract which are covered by the bond.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">The City did not feel that the opinion went far enough in that it did not \u201cseem to address the question of the possibility of the claims of sub-contractors being less than $2,673,139.00 and the City\u2019s claim on the performance aspect being greater than that amount.\u201d It presented a hypothethical situation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-6\">\u201cFor instance, suppose the total amount of the sub-contractor\u2019s claim is $1,000,000.00 and the total claim of the City on the performance aspect is $4,000,000.00. Your opinion seems to say that the sub-contractors will get a total of $1,000,000.00 but the City will only get $2,673,139.00 and, therefore, [the Surety] would only be paying out $3,673,139,00 when the Bond clearly states that it is obligated \u2018in the full and just sum of $5,346,278.00.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">The court affirmed its ruling and offered this explanation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-9\">\u201cThe Bond as signed did not conform to the requirements of Real Property Article, Section 9-112 (now Section 9-113). It was therefore necessary to read into that document the terms required by that Legislation. That Statute requires two bonds, a performance bond, the amount of which is left up to the discretion of the agency involved, and a payment bond, which must be at least 50% of the contract amount. If two individual bonds had been executed in conformity with the requirements of that Statute, the Mayor and City Council could not claim under the payment bond, nor could any supplier of materials or labor claim under the performance bond regardless of the fact that after either bond was executed no claims were payable on one bond while on the other the claims against it exceeded the maximum liability of the surety. Accordingly the maximum amount recoverable by the City under the Bond dated May 30, 1974 is $2,673,139.00. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>maximum amount recoverable by suppliers of materials of labor under that Bond is $2,673,139.00.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">We agree that under the Act the bond executed here must be construed as protecting the City as to the performance of the contract for construction of the project and as protecting persons for the amounts due them as suppliers of labor and materials for the project. In other words, the bond must be considered as having a performance aspect and a payment aspect. We also agree that the paramount purpose of the Act concerned the payment aspect. We observed in <em>Minnix, </em>259 Md. at 312, n. 1:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-7\">\u201c' * * * The doctrine to which the courts are unanimously committed is that the protection of the laborers and materialmen is the dominant purpose of the Act and a liberal construction of its procedural provisions must be resorted to when necessary to effectuate that purpose.' United States v. Peerless Casualty, 255 F. 2d 137, 143 (1958).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">The rationale of our holding in <em>Minnix </em>was that \u201cthe protection which the Maryland Statute seeks to provide for suppliers of material\u201d should not be diluted. <em>Id. </em>at 316. In the light of this, we do not agree that the penalty of the bond here must be divided down the middle. The bond is silent as to how much of the total amount for which the principal and surety is liable shall be applied to the performance aspect and how much shall be applied to the payment aspect. But, although a performance bond may be in any amount at the discretion of the public body, <em>i.e., </em>less than, equal to, or more than the amount of the contract for the project, a payment bond shall not be in an amount less than 50% of the total amount payable by the terms of the contract. Thus, it may be in any amount accepted by the parties which is equal to or greater than one-half the contract price for the project. In other words, as to the payment aspect of the bond at issue, the Act requires and supplies a provision that the payment liability shall not be less than $2,673,139, but it does not preclude or supply a provision prohibiting a payment liability in excess of that sum <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>up to a total liability agreed upon, namely, the contract price of $5,346,278. As to the performance aspect of the bond, the Act does not require or supply a provision for a penalty in any specified sum, and, thus, does not set that penalty amount at $2,673,139.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">It follows under the terms of the bond and the provisions of the Act that the Surety by executing the bond and the City by approving it are in the following position. The suppliers of labor and material are entitled to be paid in full what is due them up to a total sum of $5,346,278. If their claims are in excess of that amount, they shall receive a proportionate share of that sum. If their claims are less than the total penalty amount, but more than 50% thereof, the City is entitled to receive what is due it for nonperformance of the contract up to the difference between the amount paid the suppliers and the total liability. If the claims of the suppliers are less than 50% of the total liability, the City is entitled to receive what is due it for nonperformance of the contract up to 50% of the total liability, namely $2,673,139. This is the clear liability of the parties measured by the statute. Because the statute prohibits that the payment liability be less than 50% of the contract price, we cannot read a provision in the bond permitting an encroachment of the required payment aspect amount to satisfy damages for non-performance. Our determination is at variance with the ruling of the trial court only with regard to the possible limit of liability under the payment aspect of the bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">In reviewing the propriety of the trial court's action on a motion for summary judgment, the appellate court is concerned with whether there was a dispute as to any material fact, and if not, whether the moving party was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Rooney v. Statewide Plumbing, </em>265 Md. 559, 563-564, 290 A. 2d 496 (1972); <em>Shatzer v. Kenilworth Warehouses, </em>261 Md. 88, 95, 274 A. 2d 95 (1971); <em>Brown v. Suburban Cadillac, Inc., </em>260 Md. 251, 255, 272 A. 2d 42 (1971); Maryland Rule 610. On appeal, the City does not claim that there was a dispute as to any material fact, and we find that the Surety was entitled to partial summary judgment as a matter of law. The order of the trial court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>22 June 1977 granting the motion for partial summary judgment is affirmed. The declaration of rights contained therein is modified in accordance with this opinion, and as modified, is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">\n<em>Appeal dismissed as to Ballard-Diver Joint Venture.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">\n<em>Order of 22 June 1977 affirmed as to grant of partial summary judgment and modified as to declaration of rights in accordance with this opinion and as modified is affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">\n<em>Costs to be paid by appellant.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b457-9\">. The statute also encompassed a contract exceeding $5,000 for the construction, alteration, or repair of any public building or public work or improvement of the State of Maryland, or of any county, municipal corporation, town, board of education or other political subdivision, public authority, or public instrumentality, or any officer, board, commission, or agency of any of the foregoing. Maryland Code (1957, 1964 Repl. Vol.) Art. 90, \u00a7 11 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-10\">Chapter 10, Acts 1959, repealed former \u00a7 11 and enacted a new section in lieu thereof. The former section, which derived from Acts 1918, ch. 127, Erovided for payment for labor and materials where a contract performance ond was given to the State or any of its agencies. Chapter 349, Acts 1972 repealed \u00a7 11 (a) effective 1 January 1973 and enacted the provisions as Art. 21, \u00a7 9-112 (a). Art. 21, \u00a7 9-112 (a) was repealed by chapter 12, Acts 1974 and the provisions were enacted as \u00a7 9-112 (a) of the Real Property Article. Section 9-112 of that article was renumbered as \u00a7 9-113 by chapter 349, Acts 1976. Hereinafter in this opinion, to avoid confusion, the citation of the statute shall be to its present code designation, Maryland Code (1974, 1977 Cum. Supp.) \u00a7 9 113 (a) of the Real Property Article. It is known as the \u201cLittle Miller Act\u201d and shall be referred to as \u201cthe Act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b457-12\">The only changes in subsection (a) since its enactment in 1959 were additions to paragraph (2). Acts 1967, ch. 262 added as a third sentence: \u201cAny contractor covered by such a bond shall not be required to furnish a waiver of mechanics\u2019 liens to the State.\u201d Acts 1968, ch. 525 added as a last sentence: \u201cAny contractor prior to receiving a progress or final payment under a contract coyered hereunder shall certify in writing that he has made payment from proceeds of prior payments, and that he will make timely payment from the proceeds of the progress or final payment then due him, to his subcontractors and suppliers in accordance with his contractual arrangements with them. Acts 1970, ch. 275 inserted \u201cincluding lessors of equipment to the extent of the fair rental value thereof,\u201d immediately after \u201cfor the protection of all persons supplying labor and materials\u201d in the first sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b458-8\">. Code (1974, 1977 Cum.
