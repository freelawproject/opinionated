MORAN</author> <p id=\"ARD9\" pgmap=\"225\">delivered the opinion of the court:</p> <p id=\"b225-4\" pgmap=\"225\">Defendant appeals from a judgment of the circuit court of Randolph County finding him guilty of the crime of battery and sentencing him to 6 months\u2019 imprisonment at the Vandalia Correctional Center.</p> <p id=\"b225-5\" pgmap=\"225\">While this appeal was pending and while defendant was still incarcerated, the defendant through the office of the State Appellate Defender made a motion for an expedited appeal and a motion to proceed by memorandum instead of a brief. The State Appellate Defender stated the defendant would be likely to serve his full sentence before this court could hear the defendant\u2019s appeal unless the defendant\u2019s appeal was expedited.</p> <p id=\"b225-6\" pgmap=\"225\">This court granted defendant\u2019s motion to expedite and after reading defendant\u2019s memorandum and a transcript of the record in this cause entered an order granting defendant bond on his own recognizance. However, the defendant was released from confinement because he had completed his sentence the day this court granted him bond.</p> <p id=\"b225-7\" pgmap=\"225\">We find it unfortunate that the trial court did not grant defendant bond pending appeal in this case. We also find it unfortunate that many other trial courts do not grant defendants bond pending appeal in misdemeanor cases. The result of this practice is that many, if not the majority, of those who are sentenced because of misdemeanor convictions serve their time before this court can review their appeals. Thus defendants in many, if not most, misdemeanor cases are deprived of their right to appeal which is guaranteed them by the constitution of this State.</p> <p id=\"b225-8\" pgmap=\"225\">On June 26, 1978, the defendant was charged with the crime of battery by information filed by the State\u2019s Attorney of Randolph County. The information charged that defendant without legal justification, intentionally caused bodily harm to Martha Kifer in that he struck her in the mouth with his fist. A warrant of arrest was issued and defendant\u2019s bail was set in the amount of $2500.</p> <p id=\"b225-9\" pgmap=\"225\">The defendant was arraigned before the circuit court of Randolph County.</p> <p id=\"b225-10\" pgmap=\"225\">The trial court instructed the defendant on the elements of the charge of battery, the defendant\u2019s right to a lawyer, his right to a trial by jury and his right to call witnesses in his behalf.</p> <p id=\"b225-11\" pgmap=\"225\">The following are some exchanges between the trial court and the defendant:</p> <blockquote id=\"b226-3\" pgmap=\"226\">\u201cCourt: Are you ready this morning to enter a plea of either guilty or not guilty to the charge?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b226-4\" pgmap=\"226\">Defendant: Yes, sir.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b226-5\" pgmap=\"226\">Court: Do you have any questions before you enter that plea?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b226-6\" pgmap=\"226\">Defendant: I don\u2019t have a question. I like to tell you what happened.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b226-7\" pgmap=\"226\">Court: In that case, sir, if you have no questions, how do you wish to plead to the charge of battery?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b226-8\" pgmap=\"226\">Defendant: I am pleading guilty. Can I explain what happened?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b226-9\" pgmap=\"226\">Court: Just a moment, sir. I am going to ask if you wish to plead guilty that you sign a written plea of guilty.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b226-10\" pgmap=\"226\">Defendant: Friday afternoon she wanted to drop these charges, but she couldn\u2019t get ahold of the right person to do it because she called back down to the jail and she said it didn\u2019t do any good.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b226-11\" pgmap=\"226\">Court: The only thing I can say\u2014</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b226-12\" pgmap=\"226\">Defendant: You don\u2019t know this. I am just saying we talked to</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b226-13\" pgmap=\"226\">each other on the phone Friday about it twenty-five minutes.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b226-14\" pgmap=\"226\"># e #</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b226-15\" pgmap=\"226\">Court: Do you still wish to plead guilty, sir?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b226-16\" pgmap=\"226\">Defendant: I want to plead guilty because I want to get this over</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b226-17\" pgmap=\"226\">with. It\u2019s hard for me to get a job and I do have a job.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b226-18\" pgmap=\"226\"># # #</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b226-19\" pgmap=\"226\">Court: If you want to plead guilty, sir, I need you to sign where I marked on there with an X. Sir, would you tell me in your own words what happened.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b226-20\" pgmap=\"226\">Defendant: I was driving my own car down the highway. I had taken her out to see about a house. She is house hunting. We live in a two room apartment and that\u2019s too crowded. We was going out towards Red Bud and we kept arguing about this and that and I asked her to quiet down; she was making me nervous driving. So she kept it up this and that and finally she called me a name and I don\u2019t think anybody likes to be called, I\u2019ll tell you the name if you want to know, a nigger. She called me a black nigger and she no more than said it and I like that, my niece was sitting here and she was sitting next to the door\u2014</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b226-21\" pgmap=\"226\">Court: You indicating you hit her with the back of your hand?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b226-22\" pgmap=\"226\">Defendant: Back of my hand. Wasn\u2019t no fist.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b226-23\" pgmap=\"226\">Court: She was seated next to you\u2014</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b226-24\" pgmap=\"226\">Defendant: My niece and then my sister.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b226-25\" pgmap=\"226\">Court: In the front?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b226-26\" pgmap=\"226\">Defendant: In the front seat next to the door and she said this and that and I just turned the car around and brought her back to where her car was.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b227-4\" pgmap=\"227\">Court: Was there any type of damage that was done to her.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b227-5\" pgmap=\"227\">Defendant: Her lip was a little bit blue. Nothing like she is putting in or this damage or whatever you want to call it.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b227-6\" pgmap=\"227\"># \u00abT</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b227-7\" pgmap=\"227\">Court: Where do you work at, sir?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b227-8\" pgmap=\"227\">Defendant: I work for Leonard Gross at the orchards on Route 3.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b227-9\" pgmap=\"227\">Court: How long have you worked there?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b227-10\" pgmap=\"227\">Defendant: Since March.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b227-11\" pgmap=\"227\">Court: Is that full time work?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b227-12\" pgmap=\"227\">Defendant: That\u2019s full time. Only time I don\u2019t work is in rain.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b227-13\" pgmap=\"227\">Court: What do you do there? Do you pick the fruit?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b227-14\" pgmap=\"227\">Defendant: Well, fruit coming about the end of this month. About the fifteenth of this month.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b227-15\" pgmap=\"227\">Court: Did you work last week?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b227-16\" pgmap=\"227\">Defendant: Up until I got arrested, yes. My mind is all messed up. They came out and picked me up.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b227-17\" pgmap=\"227\">Court: Where do you live at here in the community?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b227-18\" pgmap=\"227\">Defendant: I live out there at the orchard. I got a truck and</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b227-19\" pgmap=\"227\">camper. My address is here in town.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b227-20\" pgmap=\"227\">\u00ae $ &amp;</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b227-21\" pgmap=\"227\">Court: Do you have any recommendations?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b227-22\" pgmap=\"227\">[Ass\u2019t State\u2019s Atty.]: Yes, Your Honor. In light of Mr. Kifer\u2019s past problems in Pennsylvania and due to the fact he\u2019s only been in Illinois a short time and during this time his sister has continually been a problem and at odds with each other, been in our office twice resulting in this charge, we are going to recommend, Your Honor, Mr. Kifer receives 364 days at Vandalia.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b227-23\" pgmap=\"227\">Defendant: Please\u2014</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b227-24\" pgmap=\"227\">Court: Is there anything you have to say?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b227-25\" pgmap=\"227\">Defendant: Please don\u2019t do that to me. I beg the Court don\u2019t do that to me.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b227-26\" pgmap=\"227\">Court: Do you know anything at all about Ms work at the orchard?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b227-27\" pgmap=\"227\">[Ass\u2019t State\u2019s Atty.] I haven\u2019t talked to anybody out there.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b227-28\" pgmap=\"227\">Defendant: Give me weekends if you want me to do jail time, but I don\u2019t want to go to prison. I will even do weekends for you. I requested my sister be here, but the court was to have been at one o\u2019clock today. She would have been up here at one o\u2019clock.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b227-29\" pgmap=\"227\">Court: Where did you get the idea, Mr. Kifer, it was set for one o\u2019clock?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b227-30\" pgmap=\"227\">Defendant: The Sheriff downstairs. He said I would be taken up one o\u2019clock this afternoon. He told me that three days ago and that\u2019s why I was surprised when I went up this morning.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b228-2\" pgmap=\"228\"># # #</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b228-3\" pgmap=\"228\">Court: Mr. Kifer I am going to sentence you to the Department of Corrections. It will not be though for a period of one year.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b228-4\" pgmap=\"228\">Defendant: Can\u2019t you give me a break, sir?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b228-5\" pgmap=\"228\">Court: It will be for a period of six months.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b228-6\" pgmap=\"228\">Defendant: I will lose my job, my truck and car and everything I got in the whole world. I lose everything. I come out and then I turn around and I have nothing to do for again. I got nothing. That\u2019s why I am trying to get to you this morning, try to explain to you my education is about fifth grade education and you know how hard it is for a person with college education to get a job.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b228-7\" pgmap=\"228\">Court: You have a right to appeal, sir, to appeal.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b228-8\" pgmap=\"228\">Defendant: I ain\u2019t appealing, Your Honor, but I am tired of being misused. I am being misused this morning by what you just said there, six months. I am being misused.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b228-9\" pgmap=\"228\">Court: There is a procedure that you have to follow\u2014</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b228-10\" pgmap=\"228\">Defendant: I tell you, I want somebody I don\u2019t care who to get me hold of my sister and I want to talk with her person to person, not telephone. Face to face.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b228-11\" pgmap=\"228\">Court: If you wish to listen, I am going to explain to you the process that you have to follow if you wish to appeal.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b228-12\" pgmap=\"228\">Defendant: I don\u2019t care\u2014</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b228-13\" pgmap=\"228\">Court: First of all, you cannot directly appeal the decision. There is a procedure, you have to file your notice of appeal and that\u2019s what I want to explain. First of all, you have thirty days from today\u2019s date in which to ask that you be allowed to withdraw your plea of guilty to the charge\u2014</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b228-14\" pgmap=\"228\">Defendant: I withdraw it right now at this moment.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b228-15\" pgmap=\"228\">Court: That has to be in writing.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b228-16\" pgmap=\"228\">Defendant: I\u2019ll write it.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b228-17\" pgmap=\"228\">Court: And you have to state each and every reason why you feel\u2014</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b228-18\" pgmap=\"228\">Defendant: Because I am being misused in this courtroom in Chester, Illinois.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b228-19\" pgmap=\"228\"># # #</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b228-20\" pgmap=\"228\">Court: You have the right, sir, if you are unable to afford an attorney to a court-appointed lawyer to represent you.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b228-21\" pgmap=\"228\">Defendant: I want to see one right now.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b228-22\" pgmap=\"228\">Court: Also you would be entitled to a free transcript of the proceedings this morning if you are unable to pay for it. Do you understand that?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b228-23\" pgmap=\"228\">Defendant: I want that too. There\u2019s been some lies told in this courtroom this morning by that man there.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b229-4\" pgmap=\"229\">Court: You referring to the Assistant State\u2019s Attorney?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"AoB\" pgmap=\"229\">Defendant: Yes, I am. You got false statement over there on that teletype.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b229-5\" pgmap=\"229\">The foregoing exchange between the trial court and the defendant convinces us that the trial court committed error in several respects in this case.</p> <p id=\"b229-6\" pgmap=\"229\">First, it was an abuse of discretion to sentence the defendant to 6 months imprisonment for such a minor offense. The only statement the trial court had before it concerning the nature of the offense came from the defendant who stated that he struck his sister with the back of his hand under extreme provocation. In our opinion, this did not call for such an extreme sentence.</p> <p id=\"b229-7\" pgmap=\"229\">Next, it is clear that the defendant did not really understand the nature of the proceeding in that he did not expect a prison sentence for this minor infraction of the law. This conclusion is buttressed by many statements in the record where he told the court that he was in a hurry to get back to work.</p> <p id=\"b229-8\" pgmap=\"229\">The trial court also violated Supreme Court Rule 402(c) (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1977, ch. 110A, par. 402(c)) which provides:</p> <blockquote id=\"b229-9\" pgmap=\"229\">\u201c(c) Determining Factual Rasis for Plea. The court shall not enter final judgment on a plea of guilty without first determining that there is a factual basis for the plea.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b229-10\" pgmap=\"229\">This case is similar to the case of People v. Edmonds (1973), 15 Ill. App. 3d 1073, 305 N.E.2d 346. In Edmonds the defendant admitted that she killed the man in one breath, but at the same time declared there was justification for doing the act. In this case the defendant admitted striking his sister, but denied striking her in the manner charged in the information. In addition, he stated that he hit his sister after extreme provocation. If his statement is true, we find it hard to perceive how any jury or any court sitting without a jury would find the defendant guilty.</p> <p id=\"Aks\" pgmap=\"229\"> We now must consider what to do with this case. Should we remand it to the trial court to permit the defendant to plead anew, or should we reverse it outright? It would not be just to remand this case for a new hearing. Assuming he was guilty as charged in the information, he has now served his time. He also probably lost his job and his trailer.</p> <p id=\"b229-11\" pgmap=\"229\">For the foregoing reasons the judgment of the circuit court of Randolph County is reversed.</p> <p id=\"b229-12\" pgmap=\"229\">Reversed.</p> <p id=\"b229-13\" pgmap=\"229\">KUNCE, J., concurs.</p> </opinion> <opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\"> <author id=\"b229-14\" pgmap=\"229\">Mr. JUSTICE KARNS,</author> <p id=\"Acc\" pgmap=\"229\">concurring:</p> <p id=\"b229-15\" pgmap=\"229(15) 230(36)\">I concur in the decision reached as I too believe it was an abuse of discretion to sentence the defendant to six months imprisonment for such a minor offense, simply a family squabble; however, I believe the plea proceedings were otherwise proper and in substantial compliance with Supreme Court Rule 402(c).</p> <p id=\"b230-5\" pgmap=\"230\">I do not concur in the broad language used by the majority, which would apparently establish a rule that all convicted misdemeanants are entitled to bond on appeal without regard to their prior record or the facts and circumstances of the particular case.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
