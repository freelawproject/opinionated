The determination of this question depends, upon, the construction of sections 3, 104, and 106 of the election law (chapter 909, pp. 894, 953, 956, Laws 1896). Section 3 of that act (as amended by chapter 654, p. 1668, Laws 1901) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-18\">\u201cThe polls of every general election * * * shall be opened at six o\u2019clock in the forenoon and shall close at five o\u2019clock in the afternoon. There shall be \u2019 no adjournment or intermission until the polls are closed. The closing of the polls shall be deemed to mean the close of the delivery of official ballots to electors, and the electors entitled to vote who have lawfully begun the act of voting before the time fixed for the close of the polls, shall be allowed to complete the act.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b682-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>Subdivision 1 of section 104 (Laws 1896, p. 953, c. 909), provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-5\">\u201cWhile the polls o\u00ed the election are open, the elector\u2019s entitled to vote and who have not previously voted thereat, may enter within the guard rail at the polling place o\u00ed such election for the purpose of voting, * * * and shall forthwith proceed to the inspectors and give his name.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">The delivery of the ballot to electors is therefore limited to an elector who enters within the guard rail while the polls of election are open. By section 106 the elector who has received a ballot as provided for by section 104 is entitled then and there to vote, and\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ao6\">\u201cwhen a person shall have received an official ballot from the ballot clerk or inspector as hereinbefore provided he shall be deemed to have commenced the act of voting.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">We think there can be no question about the intention of the Legislature. The polls are .to close at 5 o\u2019clock. The closing of the polls should be deemed to mean the close of the delivery of official ballots to electors. Therefore at 5 o\u2019clock the delivery of official ballots to electors must cease, and no elector to whom an official ballot has not been delivered before 5 o\u2019clock can be allowed to vote. This provision seems to be mandatory; but whether it is or not is immaterial upon this application- The election officers are as much bound to obey a direction as a mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-8\">As the closing of the polls is fixed by section 3 of the act at 5 o\u2019clock in the afternoon, no elector can receive an official ballot after that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-9\">It follows that the proceedings must be dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
