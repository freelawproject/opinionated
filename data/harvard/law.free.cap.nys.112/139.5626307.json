Proc. \u00a7 2140, relative to questions to be determined on certiorari, be disturbed; there having been competent proof of the facts necessary to be proved to authorize the determination, and it being impossible to say that there was such a preponderance of proof against the existence of any of those facts that, if the determination was based on the verdict of a jury, it could be set aside as against the weight of evidence.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b163-10\">[Ed.

A careful examination of the evidence convinces us that there was competent proof of the facts necessary to be proved to authorize the making of the determination, and we are not able to say that there was such a preponderance of proof against the existence of any of those facts that, if the determination was based upon the verdict of a jury affirming the existence thereof, we would be justified in setting it aside as against the weight of the evidence. That being so, we feel compelled, under section 2140 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which governs our hearing of the matter, to confirm the determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-16\">Determination confirmed, with $50 costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
