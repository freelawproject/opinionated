He so timely notified his employers in writing, but his testimony fails to establish a defect. That the winch reversed while he was pulling in rope over one of its drums, and caused the rope to run the opposite way, whereby the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1104\">*1104</page-number>went over the winch and struck the hatch comb, may prove the fact of accident and injury, but not the violation of legal obligation on the part of his employers, the defendants.
