He admitted he had been paid for all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1109\">*1109</page-number>the other weeks. The defendant answered also orally: \u201cGeneral denial. Bill of particulars.\u201d At the outset of the trial he conceded the employment, and virtually amended his plea by alleging the plaintiff had been paid all that he had been entitled to receive. This, together with the testimony of the plaintiff, raised the issue of payment. In support of that, the defendant introduced in evidence, with other receipts, a statement of account, \u201cSalary in full to Dec. 28/07, $15,\u201d which was signed as \u201creceived in settlement in full of account\u201d by the plaintiff. This evidence the plaintiff, called in rebuttal, did not contradict, nor did he allude to the testimony of the defendant\u2019s bookkeeper that he had said \u201cYes,\u201d to her statement on making out his voucher towards the end of January, \u201cThere is just one week\u2019s salary due.\u201d The judgment should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1133-5\">Judgment reversed and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
