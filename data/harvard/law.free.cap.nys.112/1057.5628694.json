The defendants rested upon the plaintiff\u2019s case, and prior to the charge requested the court to instruct as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1082-7\">\u201cDefendants\u2019 Counsel: I ask your honor to instruct the jury that they have no right at this time to draw any inferences from the fact that the defendants did not call any witnesses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1082-8\">\u201cThe Court: Gentlemen of the jury, I instruct you to disregard the statements made by counsel for the plaintiff. You must draw no inferences at all from the fact that the defendant did not call any witnesses.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1082-9\">Thereafter, and in the course of his charge, the trial justice instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1082-10\">\u201cNow, gentlemen, it is the duty of both the plaintiff and the defendant to call as witnesses all persons whose attendance in court they could have procured by exercising due diligence, and whose testimony would have been material to the issues in this case, and you have a right to consider the failure of either party to call any witnesses whom they might have called on the question whether or not the evidence of such witnesses would have been favorable or unfavorable to the party.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1082-11\">Upon the conclusion of the charge the counsel for the defendants, specifically excepted as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1082-12\">\u201cDefendants\u2019 Counsel: I except to that portion of your honor\u2019s charge in relation to the witnesses that might be in court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1082-13\">\u201cThe Court: I shall preserve your rights.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1082-14\">These contradictory instructions were certainly misleading, and therefore erroneous, as was likewise the refusal to charge upon request as to the effect of slight contributory negligence, to which exception was taken, as negligence, however slight, on the part of the plaintiff, if contributory, must preclude recovery.,</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-15\">' Judgment reversed'and new trial ordered, with costs to appellants to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b1082-16\">GILDERSLEEVE, P. J.</author>\n<p id=\"A_1\">I concur. In the main charge the rule in reference to absent witnesses was not correctly stated. See Rooder v. Interurban St. Ry. Co., 48 Misc. Rep. 519, 96 N. Y. Supp. <em>255.</em></p>\n<author id=\"b1082-17\">SEABURY, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AAg5\">I think that the refusal of the court to charge a request made by the counsel for the defendants justified the jury in concluding that they were to determine the comparative negligence of the parties. I concur in the view that the judgment should be reversed and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellants to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
