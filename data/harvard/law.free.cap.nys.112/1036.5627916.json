The complaint alleges the making of the contract, the failure of the contractor to carry it out, and perform the terms and conditions thereof, and that plaintiff has thereby sustained damage. The defendant asks to be informed, by a bill of particulars, in what respects th,e contractor failed to carry out its contract, and what items go to make up the plaintiff\u2019s damage. We think that the motion should have been granted. Hopper v. Weber, 84 App. Div. 266, 82 N. Y. Supp. 567; Kelly v. St. Michael\u2019s Church, 124 App. Div. 505, 108 N. Y. Supp. 927. The defendant is not in the position of a plaintiff who alleges that he has fully performed on his part, and seeks to ascertain what the defendant claims has not been performed. In such case a bill of particulars has been refused to a plaintiff because he knows what he agreed to do, and what he did, and must prove, as well as allege, full performance. The defendant surety is not to be presumed to know wherein his principal failed, or what damages resulted therefrom, and is entitled to be informed what plaintiff claims upon these points, in order properly to prepare for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-7\">Order appealed from reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and motion granted, with $10 costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
