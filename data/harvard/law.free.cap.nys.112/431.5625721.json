Notwithstanding an undertaking in conformity with the requirements of this statute was necessary to entitle the respondent to take the proceeding, we think the County Court had power to allow an undertaking to be substituted for the defective one under section 730 of the Code of Civil Procedure, and that the defect was cured by the filing of an undertaking which met all of the requirements of this amendment of the highway law. The section is very broad and comprehensive, and applies to special proceedings, as well as to actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-16\">As to the necessity of the proposed highway and the compensation of the landowners, it is only necessary to say that section 89 of the highway law has made the decision of the County Court, upon an application to confirm the decision of the commissioners, final and conclusive upon those questions.
