The defendant Exner was the plaintiff\u2019s assignor of this stock. The complaint was dismissed upon the pleadings and the plaintiff\u2019s opening.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-20\">The facts as they developed are that, while the three defendants were the sole stockholders, directors, and officers of the corporation, they caused the corporation to issue to themselves 160 shares of stock of the corporation \u201cfor which the said company received no consideration whatever, either in services performed for or property or money turned over to said corporation.\u201d Sixty-six of these shares the plaintiff later bought of the defendant Exner. Plaintiff\u2019s counsel stated in his' opening:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-21\">\u201cWe are now suing to recover the par value of those 66 shares of stock, on the ground that they were absolutely worthless, were issued in defiance of the law, and were issued without any consideration whatever.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b586-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>He also stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-4\">\u201cWe rely entirely upon the representation, contained on the face of the certificate, that it was properly issued stock. We have another suit for false representations at common law. This is an attempt to rely entirely on the face of the certificate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-5\">\u201cThe Court: This is the only representation you claim, is it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-6\">\u201cMr. Tuttle: That is the only one.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-7\">\u201cThe Court: I don\u2019t think you have any cause of action.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b586-8\">And the motion to dismiss was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-9\">It is true that section 42 of the Stock Corporation Law (Laws 1892, p. 1835, c. 688) provides that no corporation shall issue either stock or bonds, except for money, labor done, or property actually received for the use and lawful purpose of such corporation; but nothing in the act contained declares that the stock itself is void where it is issued without such consideration, or that the directors issuing the stock, or a vendor of the particular stock, is liable to a subsequent holder thereof for a violation of the provision of the act. If the corporation itself, and incidentally the plaintiff, has suffered by such unauthorized issue, a proper action doubtless lies for the benefit of the whole corporation; but- here the plaintiff sues in his individual capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-10\">Again, the plaintiff probably has his common-law remedy against his vendor for fraud and deceit; and in fact it appears from the record that such an action is actually pending and undetermined. But the complaint in this case not only falls far short of setting forth such a cause of action, but plaintiff\u2019s counsel distinctly disavowed that this was such a case.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-11\">The judgment should be affirmed, with costs. All concur, except WOODWARD and MILLER, JJ., who dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
