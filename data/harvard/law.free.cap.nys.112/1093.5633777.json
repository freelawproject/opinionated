A few days later the plaintiff, with a witness from- his lawyer\u2019s office, and having some bills in his hands, called at the warehouse, and said to a young woman at the desk that he had come to pay the charges on Zuber\u2019s goods, and was told, according to their account, that she had instructions not to take any money from Mr. Zuber; according to her version, that she could not tell what the charges were. All agree that she unavailingly tried by telephone to find the manager. The plaintiff gave his lawyer\u2019s name and telephone number (4800 Beekman) to be called up. On the manager coming in, he called the number twice that day, and was told they were out. The next day he got, as he says, the plaintiff\u2019s lawyer on telephone, who said they did not want the goods, and would not take them, that they were going to bring action against him to recover the value of the goods, to which the manager replied they would have to sue the carrier, for the goods were held on the carrier\u2019s orders. The lawyer so named tried the case, brought out these answers,, and did not contradict them. Assuming that, when the plaintiff asked for the warehouse charges, the young woman in the office said she was told not to take any money from Mr. Zuber, and that he was thereby relieved from tendering the sum of those charges, it does not appear, although the plaintiff testified he had the money to pay the charges, that he was ready or willing to pay the carrier\u2019s charges for which the goods were deposited. He was not identified and did not afford the warehouseman \u201ca reasonable time to ascertain the validity of the adverse claim or to bring legal proceedings to compel all claimants to interplead.\u201d Section 18, c. 732, p. 1711, Laws 1907. The judgment must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-7\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b1118-8\">SEABURY, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Av8W\">(concurring). To recover damages for conversion against the defendant, it was necessary for the plaintiff to prove that he had tendered the amount of the defendant\u2019s charges. The evidence of a tender was insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-9\">The judgment should be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
