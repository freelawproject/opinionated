A motion was made for an order appointing a temporary receiver upon the complaint alone, unsupported by any affidavit or other evidence. From the order granting such motion, this appeal is taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-14\">This court said, in Kieley v. Barron &amp; Cooke H. &amp; P. Co., 87 App. Div. 317, 84 N. Y. Supp. 306:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-15\">\u201cThe court is authorized to appoint a temporary receiver in such an action (Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 1788); but this does not justify the appointment of a receiver as a matter of right upon the bare allegations of the complaint alone. * * * This relief should not be awarded until final judgment, except in a case where it satisfactorily appears that it is essential to the protection of the plaintiff\u2019s rights. There was no proof before the court of the necessity for the appointment of a receiver prior to final judgment. * * * Facts and circumstances with reference to the condition and management of the corporate affairs, showing the necessity of the receivership pending the action in order to render effectual a final judgment in favor of the plaintiff, should have been shown.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b858-16\">This case was cited with approval in People v. Oriental Bank, 124 App. Div., at page 747, 109 N. Y. Supp., at page 509.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-17\">The order appealed from should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, .and the motion denied, with $10 costs, with leave to renew.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
