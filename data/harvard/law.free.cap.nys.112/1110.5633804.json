It is clear, therefore, that the demurrer was frivolous. We think, however, that the defendant should have been allowed to answer the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b1135-5\">The order appealed from is therefore modified by adding thereto a clause allowing the defendant to withdraw the demurrer and answer the complaint within 20 days after the service of a copy of the order of this court upon payment of the costs of the action, and $10 costs of the motion for judgment, and, as modified, affirmed,.without costs to either party on this appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
