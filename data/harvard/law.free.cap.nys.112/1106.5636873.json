The client has the right without assigning cause to change his attorney, and the on<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1107\">*1107</page-number>ly question before the court on this motion was whether the order should be made unconditionally or conditionally upon the plaintiff\u2019s paying or securing payment of attorney\u2019s fees. Matter of Prospect Avenue, 85 Hun, 257, 32 N. Y. Supp. 1013; Barkley v. N. Y. Central &amp; H. R. R. Co., 35 App. Div. 167, 54 N. Y. Supp. 970. The action was brought in 1905 to partition real property in which the parties had remainder interests. Nothing has ever been done \u00e9xcept to have a guardian ad litem appointed for an infant, and a referee appointed to hear and determine the issues raised by the pleadings. It appears to be undisputed that no further steps can be taken in the action because the whereabouts of the life tenant is unknown, and it is impossible to procure the consent prescribed in section 1533 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The plaintiff desires substitution of attorneys for the purpose of discontinuing the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1131-5\">It is difficult to perceive what benefit the services of the attorney have been to the plaintiff. While we do not say that the attorney has been guilty of neglect or misconduct, we do not think that this is a case in which the plaintiff should be burdened with an expensive reference to ascertain what fee, if any, should be paid him. The plaintiff wishes to discontinue a suit which was prematurely brought and which the attorney concedes cannot now be brought to a successful termination. Under these circumstances we think that justice will be subserved by leaving the attorney to his action to recover whatever he can show his services were worth.</p>\n<p id=\"b1131-6\">The order is reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion is granted, without costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
