The defendant\u2019s driver turned his team to the west, and thereby swung his load, iron girders, projecting about 10 feet from the rear of his truck, easterly across the street, striking and badly injuring one of the plaintiff\u2019s horses, which died therefrom some months later. The defendant\u2019s driver testified he held up his hand to signal the plaintiff\u2019s driver to stop, but the latter says he did not see the signal, or see that the load projected until it swung across to the injury of his team. On that statement, apparently credited by the jury, contributory negligence could not be imputed to the plaintiff\u2019s driver and the fault was of the defendant\u2019s driver, against whose employer the jury found the verdict in damages, the amount of which is not here contested.</p>\n<p id=\"b1127-7\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
