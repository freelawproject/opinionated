This evidence, not contradicted, entitled the defendant to prevail (Kipp v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 41 App. Div. 298, 58 N. Y. Supp. 494; Howard v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 18 Misc. Rep. 74, 41 N. Y. Supp. 33), as there is found in the policy no written waiver of the violated condition, nor does the evidence disclose knowledge of the fact on the part of the defendant upon which to base an estoppel. The judgment should therefore be reversed, and a new trial ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-13\">Judgment reversed and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event.
