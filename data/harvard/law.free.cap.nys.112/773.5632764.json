The actions grow out of different contracts and for different kinds of goods, and will require the determination of a number of different issues. The issues presented by. the action in the Municipal Court, with the sole exception of the statute of frauds, are in no way involved in the action in the Supreme Court. There seems to be no good reason why the plaintiff, suing upon a perfectly independent contract for an entirely different kind and charac- - ter of goods to those involved in- the Supreme Court action, should not be entitled to the prompt trial which it can obtain of those issues in the Municipal Court. It should not be required to suffer the delay incident to the disposition of the different issues in the action in the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-11\">Therefore the order appealed from should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion denied, with $10 costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
