Subsequently plaintiff demanded the repayment of the loan, which was refused, and then demanded the stock, which was also refused; Weidenfeld stating that he had deposited the stock with the defendant bank. The plaintiff then demanded the stock from the bank, which was refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-21\">It is quite evident that the examination of the defendant Bank is not at all necessary to enable the plaintiff to frame his complaint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>especially in view of the very full statement of the facts and circumstances under which the bank has received this stock, and the statement that the bank makes no claim upon it, but is simply' a bailee, contained in the affidavits on which the motion to vacate the order was made. The plaintiff has all the information that can poss,ibly be required to frame his complaint. The order for an examination before the service of a complaint can only be justified where it is necessary to enable the plaintiff to frame his complaint. He claims to be entitled to the possession of this stock, that it is deposited with the defendant bank, and he therefore had knowledge of all the facts necessary to frame the complaint. If the bank had any claim to the stock as against the plaintiff, that could be set up as a defense, and so was no part of the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action. The rules applicable to an examination of an adverse party before the pleadings are framed and that after the case is at issue to obtain evidence to be used upon the trial are entirely different; and where the bank expressly disclaims any interest in the stock, or any right to hold it, as against the depositor, there is nothing to justify an order to compel an examination of the bank before service of the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-3\">The order should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion to vacate the order for an examination of the defendant granted. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
