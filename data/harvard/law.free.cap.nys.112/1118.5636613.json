From that comes this appeal, which is frivolous, as the justice had power to revise or recall his decision. Post v. Cobb, 13 N. Y. St. Rep. 555. In the case (Siegrist v. Holloway, 7 Civ. Proc. R. [N. Y.] 58) cited by the appellant, cited now and again on such motions, and even in a respectable handbook on practice, as authority otherwise, the order was seemingly entered by the clerk who, of course, had no power to enlarge the decision of the county judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-18\">Appeal dismissed, with $10 costs to- the respondent.
