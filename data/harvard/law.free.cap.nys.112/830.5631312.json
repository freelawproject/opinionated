The plaintiff\u2019s claim is that one Rochez Vander Elst was the agent of the defendant, through whom the sales were made. To sustain the plaintiff\u2019s case, it must establish affirmatively that said Vander Elst was the agent of the defendant. The books, papers, and documents of which it desires a discovery and inspection it is claimed contain such, evidence. Plaintiff has brought itself within the provisions of sections 803-809 of the Code of Civil Procedure and rules 14-16 of the General Rules of Practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-16\">We think, however, that the order should be modified by striking therefrom the following clause: \u201cAll letter press or other copies of letters and cables sent by the defendant to Lazard Fr\u00e9res at Paris, and other bankers in Europe, respecting the defendant\u2019s business relations with said Rochez Vander Elst during the same period, now in the defendant\u2019s possession or under his control\u201d\u2014and, as so modified, affirmed, without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
