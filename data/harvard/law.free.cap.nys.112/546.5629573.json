The contract was to convey a plot 40 feet front on' a city street, with houses on it. The complaint alleges that the defendant was unable to convey because the houses overlapped and encroached four inches on the adjoining land. It prayed for specific performance, and as an alternative for a money judgment for the amount paid on the contract and the expense of examining the title.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b570-20\">Argued before JENKS, HOOKER, GAYNOR, RICH, and MILLER, <em>JJ. \u25a0</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b570-21\">A.

The claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>was that the complaint itself showed that the defendant could not perform, and that therefore the case was not of equitable jurisdiction, as specific performance will not be decreed where it is impossible. But it did not appear that it was impossible. The defendant might, for aught that appeared, put himself in a position to perform by acquiring title to the four-inch strip encroached upon. The case is no different than if the defendant had not owned any of the land he contracted to convey. The motion to send the case to the jury calendar was therefore properly denied; and as at the close it appeared that the defendant could not perform, the court had the right to give the money judgment prayed for.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">The judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">Judgment affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
