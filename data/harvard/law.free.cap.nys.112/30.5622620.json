S. was informed by the testimony of plaintiff given in supplementary proceedings that she was the owner of one half the premises, and that T. ivas the owner of the other half, and by the report of the receiver in the proceedings that he collected the half of the rents from the tenant which belonged to plaintiff until her half of the premises was sold on foreclosure.

Shorer became purchasers. Thereafter Louisa B. Treat, who owned the other undivided half of the premises, conveyed the same to said Shorers. Subsequently defendant Minnie H. Stroh acquired title to the property.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"misc\" id=\"b54-15\">The following is the opinion of Nash, Referee:</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b54-16\">The title of the defendant Stroh rests upon the title acquired by the Shorers. The disputed question in the case is whether the Shorers were purchasers of Mrs. Treat\u2019s half of the premises without notice that Mrs. Hilts had previous to their purchase acquired the interest of Sirs. Treat. It is not claimed that the Shorers had any actual notice of the contract of August 5, 1892, or of the deed from Mrs. Treat to Mrs. Hilts made in October, 1893. Sirs. I-Iilts testifies that on the day of the foreclosure sale, in Slarch, 1894, after the sale, in a conversation had with the Shorers and Sir. Ludekins, she stated to them: \u201cRemember, even though I haven\u2019t it now, I have a hold there yet.\u201d This is denied by Mr. Ludekins and by the Shorers; but, even if it was said, it was too vague and indefinite to be regarded as any notice that she had acquired by deed the interest of Sirs. Treat in the premises. It was her duty to state-definitely what her interest was. \u201cSlere loose conversation will not warrant the inference <em>of </em>notice.\u201d 12 John.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b54-17\">It is urged that the plaintiff\u2019s possession was notice to the Shorers of her rights. The Shorers were informed by the testimony of Sirs. Hilts, given in supplementary proceedings, that she was the owner of one half of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>premises, and her sister was the owner o\u00a3 the other half, and by the report of the receiver in the supplementary proceedings that he collected the half of the rents from the tenant which belonged to Mrs. Hilts until her half of the premises was sold on foreclosure. It appears from' the testimony of Mrs. Hilts that the other half of the rents was collected for Mrs. Treat. Mrs. Hilts says: \u201cShe returned it to me; gave me the power of attorney to collect it in that way.\u201d Mrs. Hilts, in her petition for the removal of a tenant, verified November 6, 1893, stated that she was the owner of one half of the premises and was the agent of her sister, who was the owner of the other half, and upon this trial she testifies that she was the agent of her sister, and as such made the lease to the tenant. It is shown by the notice of pendency, filed April 2. 1894, in the action brought by Jeannette S. Lampert against Mrs. Treat to foreclose the mortgage on her half of the premises, that Mrs. Hilts was made a defendant in that suit. The suit was settled by the purchase by the Shorers of Mrs. Treat\u2019s interest. The case shows that Mrs. Hilts did not make any open claim as the owner of Mrs. Treat\u2019s interest in the premises until the recording of her deed in June, after she had been removed by summary proceedings, taken by the Shorers in May under the title they had acquired by deed from Mrs. Treat. . Under the circumstances, it cannot be held that the possession of Mrs. Hilts after the foreclosure sale was notice to the Shorers of the right which she now claims.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b55-5\">It follows that the title of the defendant has not been successfully assailed by the plaintiff, and therefore the complaint should be dismissed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b55-6\">Argued before McLENNAN, P.
