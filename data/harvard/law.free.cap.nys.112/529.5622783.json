The deposit was of $3,000. The deceased kept the bank book, and drew out and used money from time to time during his lifetime.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b553-12\">Argued before WOODWARD, HOOKER, GAYNOR, RICH, and MILLER, JJ.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b553-13\">E.

It is a tentative trust merely, revocable at will, until the depositor dies or completes the gift in his lifetime by some unequivocal act or declaration.\u201d Matter of Totten, 179 N. Y. 112, 71 N. E. 748, 70 L. R. A. 711. It seems that the accident or fact of death turns that which may not have been and could not be found to be the intention of the deceased into his intention. But the gift is completed only at the instant of death. Up to that time the money is that of the-depositor to draw out and do with it as he pleases. That being so it must be subject to his creditors during his lifetime, and for the same reason after his death also. One may no more get his money out of reach <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>of his creditors after his death by depositing it in such a way, not to belong to his cestui until he dies, than he could do so by means of a will giving it to such cestui. His right to the absolute disposition of it during his lifetime makes it his and therefore subject to his creditors. As was said in a recent case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-5\">\u201cAs to my creditors, property is mine which becomes mine for the asking, and no words can make an instrument strong enough to hold it for me and keep it from them.\u201d Ullman v. Cameron, 186 N. Y. 339, 78 N. E. 1074, 116 Am. St. Rep. 553.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">This was said, it is true, of a pretended trust provision for another in a will, but has just as strong an application to a scheme by which one tries to so fix his property that he may have the absolute control and disposition of it up to the time of his death, but keep it away from' his creditors. The deceased did not even have to ask anyone; the money was in his own control.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">No objection is made to the form or maintainability of the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-8\">The judgment should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-9\">Judgment reversed, on question of fact and of law, and new trial granted; costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
