The complaint was dismissed at the trial for not stating facts sufficient, in that there is no allegation that the plaintiff has been in possession of the land for one year. The allegation is that the plaintiff is and has been for more than one year \u201cseized and possessed\u201d of the land; but this is followed by an allegation that the land is \u201cvacant and not actually occupied.\u201d Nevertheless the complaint is good, for possession is alleged, and constructive possession suffices. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1042\">*1042</page-number>said statute at first required \u201cactual possession,\u201d but by amendment in 1891 (section 1, c. 210, p. 403, Laws 1891), the word \u201cactual\u201d was omitted. The phrase was used in the opposite sense of \u201cpossession in law, or constructive possession\u201d (Churchill v. Onderdonk, 59 N. Y. 134). The illustration in Clason v. Stewart, 23 Misc. Rep. 177, 51 N. Y. Supp. 1100, of constructive possession, in reference to this change in the statute, viz., \u201cshowing that a constructive possession, as through tenants, is sufficient,\u201d was inadvertent, for possession through a tenant would be actual possession. .</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-5\">The order should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-6\">Order reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements. \u25a0 All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
