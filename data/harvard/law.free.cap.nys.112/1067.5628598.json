Some of its servants present on the scene did unavailingly try to prevent the accident by warning the driver, and others arriving later with a wrecking wagon endeavored without success with their tackle to rescue the horse injured. These efforts to assist the plaintiff\u2019s driver out of his distress were not part of -the duty of the defendant\u2019s servants, and their failure did not bring them into connection with the accident. The judgment must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-8\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellants to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
