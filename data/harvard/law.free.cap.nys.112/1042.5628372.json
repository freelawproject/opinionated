The defense pleaded was an oral agreement, made before the making and delivery of the note, that the defendant should only be required to pay the sum of $18.75 per week so long as he remained in business and purchased beer of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"Ali\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1043\">*1043</page-number>The evidence of the verbal agreement was not competent to contradict or vary the terms of the written instrument. Jamestown Business College Association v. Allen, 172 N. Y. 291, 64 N. E. 952, 92 Am. St. Rep. 740. However, it was received without objection, and we will consider its effect. The defendant testified that- the arrangement for taking out the license was made with the plaintiff\u2019s collect- or, who informed the defendant that, if he should discontinue taking beer and should close out, he would not have to pay any more license, but that did not amount to an agreement that the note should be considered paid upon the defendant\u2019s discontinuing business. Said statement was not inconsistent with a continuing obligation on the part of the plaintiff to pay any unpaid balance on the note. Upon discontinuing business, the defendant might have obtained a rebate for the enexpired term. It appears, however, that he was convicted of a violation of the liquor tax law (Laws 1896, p. 45, c. 1121, amended by Laws 1897, p. 207, c. 312), thereby forfeiting-the rebate to which he would otherwise -have been entitled. The \u25a0 conversation testified to did not establish an agreement that the note, which was subsequently given, should be deemed paid upon the defendant\u2019s discontinuing business, even had it been competent thus to vary the terms of the written instrument, and it was error to dismiss the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-5\">The judgment should be - reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-6\">Judgment of the .Municipal Court reversed and new trial ordered, costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
