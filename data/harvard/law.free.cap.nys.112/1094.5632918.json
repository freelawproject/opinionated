The complaint is \"action on a check,\u201d and the answer is \u201cgeneral denial and' demand bill.\u201d A bill of particulars was given, which reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1119-8\">The above action is brought to recover the sum of $56.60, with interest from May 16, 1908, due on a check given to plaintiff by Harry Schantz, etc., one of the defendants, and originally made by Sam Goldman. The following is a copy of the check in question:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1119-9\">\u201cNo. -. New York, May 16, 1908.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1119-10\">\u201cThe Corn Exchange Bank.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1119-11\">\u201cEleventh Ward Branch.

Schantz or order Fifty-Six \u00abo/ioe Dollars.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1119-14\">\"$56.6o/100. g.

O. Address: 87 Suffolk St., N. Y. City.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1119-18\">This check was never indorsed by the payee, and therefore never became negotiable. Edelman v. Rams (Sup.) 109 N. Y. Supp. 816. On the trial no effort was made to amend the complaint, but plaintiff sought to show that the check was given as earnest money to bind a contract for the sale of a store, and that defendant refused to complete the bargain on the ground of misrepresentations. Be this as it may, the action was brought on the check itself, which, as we have seen, was never indorsed by the payee.</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-19\">The judgment should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-20\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered with costs to appellants to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
