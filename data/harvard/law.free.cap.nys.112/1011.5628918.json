One of them testified that he ordered a drink of whiskey of the defendant, that the defendant served the same to him from his bar, that he drank it, and that it was whiskey. He was cross-examined as an expert, and because he could not tell the \u201ccomponent parts\u201d of whiskey, or whether the liquor served to him was \u201ca distilled or rectified spirit,\u201d or whether there are \u201cmany medicines\u201d that smell like whiskey, we are asked to hold that he was not competent to know whiskey when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1012\">*1012</page-number>he drank it\u2014and this although he said he had been drinking whiskey for 30 years. This is an old story, and it were well if the courts heard it for the last time. Counsel for the defendant fails even to perceive that the fact that in answer to an order for whiskey the defendant produced a liquid to fill the order, was evidence that it was whiskey. The other policeman testified to the giving and filling of the order, but did not taste or smell the drink.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-5\">The judgment should be affirmed.
