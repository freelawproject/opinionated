The defendant appeals from so much of the order as disallows the mileage of eight witnesses summoned to the city of New York from Buffalo, and the plaintiffs appeal from so much of the order as denied their motion to strike from the bill of costs a sum allowed for commissioner\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-15\">The action involved transactions in Buffalo, and required the attendance of witnesses from that city. The defendant sought to tax mileage, at the rate of $33.84 each, for eight witnesses. A majority of these witnesses either now are, or recently have been, in defendant\u2019s employ, while another is in the employ of a lessee of defendant. The other two are in the employ of other railroad companies. It is conceded that all of these witnesses traveled on free passes issued by defendant, and that defendant has paid no mileage or other sum to any of them, and that no demand therefor has been made. The only plea by which the allowance is sought to be enforced is that perhaps the defendant may hereafter be called upon to pay the mileage. The improbability of such a demand, unless the defendant shall invite it-in order to mulct the plaintiffs, is obvious. This item was properly disallowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-16\">The court should, however, have gone further, and have stricken out the sum allowed for commissioner\u2019s fees. No order appointing a commission was made, but by consent the depositions of certain witnesses were taken in the office of defendant\u2019s attorneys. A notary public in the employ of such attorneys administered the oaths to the witnesses, but did nothing else. Each attorney had his own stenographer present, who took down the testimony, which was not signed by the witnesses. No agreement was made as to the payment of the stenographers\u2019 fees. Eor the fees of the notaries who administered the oaths to the witnesses the sum of $23.20 has been allowed. It should have been disallowed. The notaries were in no sense commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>sioners, and, even if they are to be so considered, section 3256 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides that they shall be entitled to \u201creasonable compensation.\u201d For the services they performed the allowance was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">The order so far as appealed from by the defendant is affirmed, and so far as appealed from by the plaintiff is reversed, and the item of $23.20 is disallowed, with $10 costs and disbursements to the plaintiff appellant. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
