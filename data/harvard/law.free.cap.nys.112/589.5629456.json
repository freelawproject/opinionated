He was carried to a point where another line of th\u00e9 defendant intersected. The two lines ran along separate streets and in different directions. He entered a car of the second line, and when he offered the said transfer ticket for his fare it was refused, and he was compelled to pay a 5-cent fare. He has recovered $50 as a penalty, and 5 cents excess fare. It appears that the said lines were owned by the defendant and that neither was operated under a lease. The judgment cannot' be upheld under section 101 of the railroad law (Laws 1890, p. 1113, c. 565), for the plaintiff was not .seeking a continuous ride or a continuous passage under section 101 of the railroad <em>law; </em>nor did he show that the defendant was within the purview of section 104 thereof. O\u2019Connor v. Brooklyn Heights R. R. Co., 123 App. Div. 784, 108 N. Y. Supp. 471.</p>\n<p id=\"Agm\">It is quite true that the defendant issued a transfer which purported to be valid on the second line; but it does not appear from the record, but the contrary, that it was legally required to do so. If it was not thus required, but could legally require the payment of a 5-cent fare on the second line, then it neither asked nor received more than the lawful rate of fare for the passage upon its second line, and hence it is not subject to an action for the penalty prescribed by section 39 of the railroad law. Its liability, if any, for its voluntary issue of a transfer which it represented as valid upon the second line, its subsequent refusal to accept it upon that line, and its exaction of a fare, presents a question not involved in this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-10\">The judgment is reversed, and a new trial ordered; costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
