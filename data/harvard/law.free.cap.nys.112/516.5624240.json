On that day he went to an office of the defendant in the borough of Manhattan, and after writing a business telegram to Mr. William R. Petze at 623 West avenue, Kensington, Brooklyn, handed it to the operator in charge, with 50 cents. He testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-9\">\u201cShe said the telegram would be 27 cents. Q. She read it, after you wrote it? A. She read it, and she said: \u2018You know we cannot take this, only subject to delay\u2019 I says: \u2018Is that so?\u2019 She says: \u2018Yes.\u2019 I says. \u2018How much delay?\u2019 And she says: \u2018I can\u2019t say. I can\u2019t tell you anything about it.\u2019 She had already marked up the telegram, and I said: \u2018Well, you won\u2019t take it, and deliver it within an hour?\u2019 She said: \u2018No; I can\u2019t say what the delay will be. We will only take it subject to delay.\u2019 And she just handed me back the telegram and my 50-eent piece, after she had marked up the telegram.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b541-11\">The plaintiff took the money and telegram back and made no further effort to procure its transmission. He later brought this action \u25a0 to recover the statutory penalty of $100. When plaintiff rested his case, defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the complaint was granted, and from the judgment accordingly entered this appeal is taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-12\">_No negligence of the defendant is alleged or claimed, and the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action rests solely on the theory that by refusing to accept the telegram, in the manner and under the circumstances stated the defendant made itself liable. I think the evidence was insufficient to establish a cause of action, and that the dismissal of the complaint was justified. It has been held by the courts of this state, in construing the section of the statute quoted, that the penalty is only incurred by acts of partiality, bad faith, or discrimination (Wichelman v. Western Union Tel. Co., 30 Mise. Rep. 450, 63 N. Y. Supp. 491; Hearn v. Western Union Tel. Co., 36 Mise. Rep. 557, 73 N. Y. Supp. 1077; Gifford v. Glen Telephone Co., 54 Mise. Rep. 468,\" 106 N. Y. Supp. 53) ; and the same construction has been given to similar statutes in Arkansas and Indiana (State\" v. Western Union Tel. Co., 76 Ark. 134, 88 S. W. 834; Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Swain, 109 Ind. 405, 9 N. E. 937).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>There is no evidence in the case at bar tending to establish in the slightest degree partiality, bad faith, or discrimination; but it is contended, upon the authority of Marvin v. Same Defendant, decided by the former District Court of the City of New York and reported only in 15 Chi. Leg. N., at page 416, that the omission of defendant\u2019s operator to explain the nature and extent of the possible delay at the time of the presentation of the message was tantamount to the refusal contemplated by the statute; in other words, was an absolute refusal to receive and transmit the message. We are not in accord with this contention; but, if that were the rule, it is plainly apparent in the case at bar that the plaintiff knew the reason and nature of the anticipated delay. It is equally apparent that the operator did not know the extent of the delay, and she so advised plaintiff. His demand was, not for an impartial transmission and delivery, but for a preference for his message, namely, it must be delivered \u201cwithin an hour\u201d; and it was not until after this demand had been made that the operator returned the message and money, with the assertion that she would not receive it under such conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">The judgment must be affirmed, with costs.. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
