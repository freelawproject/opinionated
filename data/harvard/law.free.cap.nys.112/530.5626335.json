On the former trial the driver, Thomas Speedling, Jr., testified that just as he was turning on the track he looked back once before he was run into. A recovery was had, and an appeal to this court was taken. Mr. Justice Gaynor, speaking for the court, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AtU\">\u201cHe does not say he looked back before turning, or that he had completed his turn and was going along on the track before he was run into. It was for the plaintiff to show these things.\u201d 113 App. Div. 673, 99 N. Y. Supp. 946.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b555-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>On the second trial this same witness testifies that he looked back four times in his effort to determine whether any car was approaching. This evidence was apparently given to meet the criticism of the court on his former evidence. No satisfactory explanation of this change in evidence is given and there is no corroboration of him. Examining the facts, we do not think his evidence worthy of belief, and hence the plaintiff has failed to sustain the burden of proof. Edall v. New England R. R. Co., 40 App. Div. 617, 57 N. Y.
