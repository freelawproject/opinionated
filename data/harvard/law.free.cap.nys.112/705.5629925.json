Kleinhaus, 94 Newark avenue, Jersey City, N. J., and took a receipt therefor, in which it was stipulated that the parcel was received upon the condition that defendant\u2019s liability in case of nondelivery should not exceed the sum of $50. The parcel was not delivered, and the plaintiffs have recovered a judgment in the Municipal Court for $131.77 damages, its full value. There is no allegation or claim of any negligence on the part of the express company, and the recovery was had solely because of defendant\u2019s failure to deliver.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-17\">The respondent contends that section 38, c. 429, p. 911, of the Laws of 1907, imposes an absolute liability on every common carrier, including express companies, for goods lost in transit. This cannot be so when the goods are shipped out of the state, because the act cited has no application to interstate or foreign commerce (section 25). No negligence having been shown on the part of defendant, we think plaintiffs are bound by the terms of the agreement, which limits defendant\u2019s liability to the amount it has paid into court.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-18\">The judgment of the Municipal Court must therefore be reversed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b729-19\">GAYNOR, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AhJ\">(concurring in the result). I concur because\u2019there is no allegation of negligence in the complaint, it sounding on contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>only. If there were, we would have before us the question whether the failure to deliver does not in and of itself make out a prima facie case of negligence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
