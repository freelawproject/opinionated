Hapgoods v. Lusch, 123 App. Div. 23, 107 N. Y. Supp. 331, and cases cited. But the plaintiff complains that the loan to th$ corporation was made at the request of the defendants, upon the security and faith of the agreement executed by subscribers, including these defendants, and upon the promises therein contained, which were made in express contemplation of the loan, and which authorized the procurement of the loan upon the faith of such agreement. In view of these allegations, I think that the complaint can be upheld under the judgment in Knickerbocker Trust Co. v. Hard, 67 App. Div. 463, 73 N. Y. Supp. 979. I think that the complaint is not bad, in that it does not contain any allegation of a precedent judgment against the corporation, or any plea of excuse for not obtaining such a judgment. The reason is that the plaintiff does not plead a liability which merely presents the corporation as the \u201cprimary debt- <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>or\u201d and the defendants as \u201cultimate and subsidiary\u201d debtors, to use the expressions of the court in Handy v. Draper, 89 N. Y. 335.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">The interlocutory judgment is affirmed, with costs, with'leave to plead over on the payment of costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
