The policy provides, as a condition precedent to maintaining the action, that the insured should, within 60 days after the fire occurred file with the company sworn <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>proofs of loss. It is conceded that such proofs were not filed, and the respondent\u2019s contention to support the judgment r\u00e9sts upon the conduct of one of the defendant\u2019s adjusters and his conversations with him, which it is claimed establishes a waiver of the requirement of the policy to file such proof of loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">The evidence does not support this contention and the judgment must be reversed, and a new trial ordered; costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
