Seneca Lake Grape &amp; Wine Co., 53 Hun, 174, 180, 5 N. Y. Supp. 136, 139, Justice Barker said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-6\">\u201cThe purpose of the statute is to require notice to be given to the Attorney General of the time and place when the petition will be presented to \"the court, that he may be present and be heard upon the initiatory application, as well as all the other proceedings to be had in the matter, and, unless service of such notice is waived, the court has no jurisdiction to entertain the proceeding, and, as the statute has declared, the order is void.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">No notice of the application for the show-cause order, or of any of the subsequent proceedings, was given to the Attorney General. It appears, however, that subsequent to the entry of the show-cause order, and after the motion was made in this proceeding, the Attorney General admitted due and timely service of the notice of motion and signed waivers antedating the order. The date is unimportant. The question is: Piad the Attorney General the power to validate the proceeding? It is undoubtedly true that he might have conferred jurisdiction by waiving service of the papers before the motion Was brought on for hearing; but this was not done, and I am of the opinion that he was without authority to validate the order by appearing after it had been made, and that the court was without jurisdiction to entertain the proceeding, and that the order made therein and proceedings thereunder-were void. The order was binding upon no one, it was an absolute nullity, and there is no power in the Attorney General to validate it.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-8\">The order must be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and motion granted. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
