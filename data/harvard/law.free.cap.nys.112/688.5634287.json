The alleged abandonment is said to have taken place in the year 1900, and the evidence is far from convincing that the separation which then took place amounted to an abandonment, or to anything more than a separation by mutual consent. Assuming, however, that the abandonment was sufficiently shown, it was not shown that the wife is liable to become a charge upon the public, and it is admitted by the respondent that, to justify the order, this must be shown, as well as the fact of abandonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-14\">For this failure of proof, the order and judgment must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-15\">PATTERSON, P. J., and INGRAHAM and CRARKE, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b712-16\">RAUGHRIN, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A65o\">(dissenting). The evidence, I think, amply sustains the charge of abandonment, and sufficiently shows that, owing to complainant\u2019s ill health and destitute condition, she is liable to become dependent on the public for support and maintenance.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-17\">I therefore vote for affirmance.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
