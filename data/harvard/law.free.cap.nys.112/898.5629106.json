An order like the one in question rests largely in the discretion of the Special Term, but facts and circumstances must appear in the motion papers before such discretion can properly be exercised. The belief of a party in his inability to procure an impartial trial is insufficient, in the absence of facts and circumstances showing such belief to be well founded. The People v. Sammis, 3 Hun, 560; The People v. Wright, 5 How. Prac. 23, 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-5\">The record herein discloses no facts sufficient to invoke the exercise of any discretion on the part of the Special Term. It shows an extensive acquaintance by the defendant, and business and political prominence and activity on his part, and also professional and political prominence of his attorneys. These facts are insufficient to justify the order. Lent v. Ryder, 47 App. Div. 415, 62 N. Y. Supp. 400; Weiant v. Rockland Lake Trap Rock Company, 74 App. Div. 24, 76 N. Y. Supp. 699. Juries are not likely to be influenced, by such unworthy considerations. It sometimes is the case that wide acquaintance and prominence is a disadvantage to the person possessing the same. In this case plaintiff has already procured one judgment against the defendant, which was reversed on appeal. It is quite clear that neither defendant nor his counsel exercised any hypnotic or sinister influence over the jury which rendered that verdict. It appears that there has since been another trial, in which difficulty was experienced in getting a jury, and the jury thus procured disagreed. Neither circumstance is uncommon in the administration of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-6\">The learned, justice at Special Term based his order largely on the fact that the action has attracted wide attention and has been largely discussed, and that its history at Trial Tenns and on appeal had been given wide publication by the newspapers of the county. There is nothing, however, to indicate that any unfair or inaccurate statement has ever been published, or that the newspaper statements have been prejudicial to plaintiff. Non constat they have worked to the prejudice of .defendant. Nor is there any pretense that defendant or any one in his behalf has attempted to manufacture public sentiment or to publish or promulgate colored or inaccurate information. See People v. Sarvis, 69 App. Div. 604, 74 N. Y. Supp. 1067. Even though some people may have formed an opinion, that fact alone does not disqualify them from acting as jurors. Plaintiff failed entirely to make out a prima facie case for the order in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-7\">The order must be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements and the motion denied, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
