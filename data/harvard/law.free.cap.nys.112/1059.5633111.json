J.</author>\n<p id=\"ANr7\">This action is brought to recover damages for breach of contract arising out of defendant\u2019s cancellation of an order for calendars placed by him with plaintiff. The evidence shows that on the 17th day of February, 1908, plaintiff\u2019s salesman, one Camp-stein, procured of the defendant a written order for calendars for which defendant agreed to pay on delivery. The said order was forwarded to plaintiff by its salesman, and on the 30th day of February, 1908, plaintiff notified defendant of its acceptance of said order. The order, signed by this defendant, contained, among others, the following provisions, printed in plain type directly over the space bearing defendant\u2019s signature, viz.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1084-20\">\u201cThese goods are to be specially made, and this order is not subject to countermand after its acceptance by Metropolitan Aluminum Mfg. Co. No special arrangements or promises of any kind by agents will be recognized, unless expressly written in this order and approved of by Metropolitan Aluminum Manufacturing Co.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1084-21\">On or about March 10, 1908, the defendant addressed a communication to the plaintiff, canceling the order signed by him on the 17th day of February, 1908, and claiming that prior to the signing of the order by him he had informed plaintiff\u2019s salesman that he (defendant) had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1061\">*1061</page-number>already placed an order for calendars with another concern, known as Ellery\u2019s, but that he did not fancy the desigfi, and that the plaintiff\u2019s salesman then told defendant that he (defendant) could cancel Ellery\u2019s order, but, should he be unable to do so, then he could countermand the order placed by him with plaintiff, and that defendant had not been able to cancel the order placed with Ellery. This alleged arrangement between the defendant and plaintiff\u2019s salesman does not appear on the order signed by the defendant and accepted by the plaintiff, which order appears to be complete and absolute on its face, and by the provisions above quoted, contained therein, precludes the arrangement between defendant and plaintiff\u2019s agent which is relied on by defendant to defeat plaintiff\u2019s claim. While it is true that parol evidence is admissible to show that a writing which is in form a complete contract was not to become a binding contract until the performance of some condition precedent resting in parol (Reynolds v. Robinson, 110 N. Y. 654, 18 N. E. 127; Mayer v. Dean, 115 N. Y. 556, 22 N. E. 261, 5 L. R. A. 540), still it seems to us under the facts here presented that, when the defendant signed the order containing the above quoted condition, he waived the arrangement, totally inconsistent' therewith, which he had orally made with the plaintiff\u2019s agent. Furthermore, the agent\u2019s promise to defendant did not bind the plaintiff, since defendant had direct notice that in making such promise the agent transcended his authority. Moreover, the position of salesman merely signifies a limited authority, and the defendant was as a matter of law charged with notice thereof, so that before trusting to it he was bound to ascertain its extent. Beck v. Donohue, 27 Misc. Rep. 230, 57 N. Y. Supp. 741; Allen v. Insurance Co., 88 Hun, 461, 34 N. Y. Supp. 872; Michael v. Eley, 61 Hun, 180, 15 N. Y. Supp. 890. It is a well-established rule that third parties dealing with an avowed agent, and more particularly a special agent, are put upon their guard by the very fact, and do so at their own risk. They cannot rely upon the agent\u2019s assumption of authority, but are to be regarded as dealing with the power before them, and must at their peril observe that the act done by the agent is legally identical with the act authorized by the power. Joseph v. Struller, 25 Misc. Rep. 173, 54 N. Y. Supp. 162; 1 Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. of Law (2d Ed.) p. 987. Persons relying upon stipulations and promises made by the agents varying or waiving the printed provisions in the contract do so at their own peril. Allen v. Insurance Co., supra; Legnard v. Insurance Co., 81 App. Div. 320, 81 N. Y. Supp. 516; Messelback v. Norman, 122 N. Y. 578, 26 N. E. 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-4\">Judgment reversed and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
