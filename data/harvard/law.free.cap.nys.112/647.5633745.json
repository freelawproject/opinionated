In 1897 defendants erected a stone and brick structure upon said premises which extends to the building line of the street, beyond the front of the other \u25a0 buildings on the avenue, and it is sought by plaintiff who is the owner of a dwelling house on the opposite side of the street, to perpetually enjoin the defendants from maintaining a building or structure within 10 feet of the northerly line of the street.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">We are at a loss to understand why there should be any disagreement as to the meaning of this clause. There are several separate covenants contained in the deed. The one under consideration, however, may be construed without reference to the others. It runs with the land, and provides that the grantor, his heirs and assigns, should never erect or permit on said premises, or any portion thereof, any building within 10 feet of the land of Bay avenue; that is, within 10 fee of the street line. When the defendants acquired title to the premises, it was subject to this restriction. They undertook to keep the covenant, and cannot complain if neighbors object to its violation. The plaintiff acquired title to the premises owned by her from defendants\u2019 grantor, who was the common grantor of all of the property in that block upon which dwelling houses have been erected; and, if she feels herself aggrieved, the power of the court may be invoked for relief, and judgment is ordered for the plaintiff for the relief demanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">Judgment for the plaintiff on submission of controversy, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
