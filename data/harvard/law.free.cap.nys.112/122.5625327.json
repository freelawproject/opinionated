We think this was not a sufficient reason for making the order appealed from. The privilege may not be insisted upon when the party is called to answer, and as to some or all of the matters his answers might not tend to criminate him at all. The better time to raise the question of privilege is when the examination is had. Ryan v. Reagan, 46 App. Div. 590, 62 N. Y. Supp. 39; Matter of Sayre, 70 App. Div. 329, 75 N. Y. Supp. 286.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">But the respondent claims the order for the examination was properly vacated for the reason that there was no proper service of the order and affidavits upon one of the defendants, Beaty. All the other defendants had appeared in the action and were properly served, Beaty resided in Canada and had not been served with summons. The order for examination directed the service of the order and affidavits to be made upon him by mail, and that such service should be sufficient to comply with section 875 of the Code of Civil Procedure, and service was so made. The respondent claims that such service was insufficient, and no service upon Beaty could be made, so as to comply with the Code, so long as Beaty was a nonresident and had not been served with a summons in the action. The section of the Code (875) provides that, if a party has not appeared in the action, the service shall be made upon him as directed by the order. I think the order and compliance with its terms were a sufficient service in this kind of a proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">The case was here on appeal from a former order, reported in 121 App. Div. 893, 105 N. Y. Supp. 1114. This question was not then passed upon. There had then been no attempted service upon Beaty, and no order directing the manner of such service.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-9\">Order reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and motion denied, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
