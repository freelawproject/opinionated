The only foundation for the order which plaintiff has obtained is the statement contained in his complaint, and reiterated in his petition, that defendants agreed to pay him, in addition to a fixed salary, 20 per cent, of the profits realized in defendants\u2019 business. In an affidavit read in support of his petition plaintiff details the facts relating to his employment, and shows that all that took place respecting any proportion of the profits was that he was promised \u201ca piece of any new business that he (deponent) might be instrumental in obtaining,\u201d and that even a definite arrangement as to such share of the profits was not made. This furnishes no ground for ordering an inspection of books and papers.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-14\">Order reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and motion denied, with $10 costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
