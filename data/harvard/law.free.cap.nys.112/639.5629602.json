The complaint alleges \u201cthat the defendant James Taylor was at all the times hereinafter mentioned engaged in the construction, building, repairing, and placing of certain iron fire escapes and the appurtenances thereto belonging\u201d upon a building in the city of New York. This allegation includes the time of the accident, and is admitted by the failure to deny it. The evidence shows that- between half-past 11 in the forenoon and noon, while the plaintiff was passing along the sidewalk in front of the building upon which the defendant was engaged in constructing the fire escape, an iron worker\u2019s hammer, weighing from eight to ten pounds, \u201cthat they fix those fire escapes with,\u201d as the plaintiff says, fell from above and struck him on the head, inflicting the injuries for which he has recovered. Immediately after the accident tools and instruments used for putting up fire escapes were found lying on the fire escape at the fourth or fifth story of the building\u2014some 40 or 50 feet above the sidewalk\u2014and the witness who found them testified that he did not see any other workmen about and did not see any tools, except on the fire escape. The defendant gave no evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>I think the uncontradicted evidence, in connection with the ad- . mission, sufficiently connected the defendant with the accident to establish a prima facie case. Wolf v. American Tract Society, 164 N. Y. 30, 58 N. E. 31, 51 L. R. A. 241, and Jack v. McCabe, 56 App. Div. 378, 67 N. Y. Supp. 810, cited by, the appellant, are not in point. In those cases the employ\u00e9s of a large number of independent contractors were engaged in work upon the building at the time of the accident, and it was not shown which contractor\u2019s employ\u00e9s were guilty of the negligence resulting in the accident. In the case at bar it does not appear that any work was being done upon the building, except by the servants of the defendant. The distinction is clearly apparent.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">The judgment and order must be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
