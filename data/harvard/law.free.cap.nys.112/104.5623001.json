The indictment charged an assault with a loaded revolver and firing same with intent to kill, which constituted assault in the first degree. The conviction was of assault in the second degree, which was alike assault, but without intent to kill. There was considerable conflict in the evidence as to whether the defendant fired the shot which took effect upon the complainant. It seems to me, however, that there was a large preponderance of evidence that the shot was fired by defendant, and that the jury might well be satisfied of that fact beyond a reasonable doubt, and were fully justified in rendering the verdict they did. They might very properly have believed and found the intent to kill existed also, and have convicted of the hig\u2019her degree of assault in the first degree; but they were empowered to pass upon the question, and very likely had a reasonable doubt as to whether the intent to kill was present. It is not improbable that the jury preferred to convict of the lesser offense, so as to make the punishment lighter. It was their responsibility, and not the court\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-19\">There are no exceptions which call for special consideration, except perhaps one\u2014the refusal by the court to charge the jury that they might convict of assault in the third degree, and the remark by the court that there was no evidence in the case which would justify such a verdict. This remark was entirely correct. The defendant, if he fired the shot, was guilty of assault in the first or second degree. If he did not fire it, he was guilty of no offense under the indictment. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>The court was, therefore, justified in the refusal to charge as requested. People v. De Garmo, 73 App. Div. 46, 76 N. Y. Supp. 477. This case was decided in this department, and seems to be in point here. There were no reversible errors committed by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">Judgment of conviction, affirmed. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
