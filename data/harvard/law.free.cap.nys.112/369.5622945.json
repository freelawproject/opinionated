Defendant has been charged with negligence in the killing of plaintiff\u2019s intestate, where the manner of the killing is at the best speculative. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>The verdict has been reached upon the testimony of a brother-in-law, whose evidence is not sufficiently credible to sustain a verdict in view of the testimony which he gave upon the former trial. The report of the deceased upon the morning of the accident, failing to disclose any defect the night before in the lamp at which he was killed, either negatives the evidence that the lamp was not burning the night'before, or shows negligence on the part of the deceased in failing to discover the defective lamp. The company should not be charged with notice of a defect which it was the duty of the deceased to report, and which he failed to report. Moreover, it has not been proven that the failure of the light to burn the night before was due to any defect which caused the decedent\u2019s death upon the following night.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">Judgment and order reversed and a new trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
