Thereupon the plaintiffs excepted, and requested to go to the jury upon certain questions of fact. The motion was denied'as too late; the court saying, \u201cYou should have made that before the court directed its verdict\u201d; and exception was taken. While the motions for direction were not specifically passed upon, the direction by the court was, in effect, a denial of one and a granting of the other, and the immediate request of the plaintiffs was apparently timely, and, although the trial justice was clothed with the functions of a jury, the plaintiffs were not precluded, if there was evidence to submit, as there was herein, from requesting to go to the jury upon facts that were disputed (Shultes v. Sickles, 147 N. Y. 704, 41 N. E. 574), because the record does not disclose that the verdict had been both directed and entered at the time of the request for submission. \u201cWhere, however,\u201d this court has said, \u201cupon the trial of an action both parties asked the court to direct a verdict, and after the verdict has been ^directed and entered by the clerk, and the defeated party excepts to the direction, he cannot subsequently insist upon his right to go to the jury upon a disputed question of fact.\u201d Zajic v. Elian, 50 Misc. Rep. 289, 98 N. Y. Supp. 652, 653. The judgment and order appealed from must therefore be reversed, and a new trial granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-9\">Judgment and order reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to the appellants to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-10\">GILDERSEEEVE, P.
