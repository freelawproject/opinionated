There was no such issue. It was alleged in the 38th subdivision of the amended complaint that such notice had been filed. There was no denial of this in the answer. The denial that the defendant \u201chas any knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief as to any of the allegations in said amended complaint,\u201d except, etc., was not a denial of it. It was a frivolous denial in respect of it. If the notice was filed it was in a public office of the city, and the city is therefore presumed to have knowledge, whether it was filed or not. In such a case such a denial is not permissible. Rochkind v. Perlman, 123 App. Div. 808, 108 N. Y. Supp. 224, 1151; Purdy v. City of New York, 126 App. Div. 320, 110 N. Y.
