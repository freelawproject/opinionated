The sales were testified to by four witnesses, special excise agents of the state. There seemed to be no doubt as to the sales of liquor; but it was claimed the service of the liquor was in connection with genuine meals ordered by and served to the witnesses. The evidence given in behalf of defendant to sustain this claim was very unsatisfactory, and in our judgment entirely failed to overcome the evidence given by the petitioner\u2019s four witnesses. These men knew what the truth was. They went to defendant\u2019s place for the express purpose of ascertaining whether he was violating the law. They could not be mistaken as to the evidence they gave, and if it was untrue they were guilty of deliberate perjury. They were performing a duty as state agents, were under no obligation to testify to anything that was untrue, and we cannot believe the evidence they gave in this proceeding was untrue.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-17\">We do not regard it as necessary to enter upon an analysis of the evidence given for defendant; but a careful reading of it fails to throw any doubt upon the evidence given for petitioners. This being so, we cannot permit this order to stand. The excise law must be enforced, and the courts should not permit any flimsy pretexts to prevent the revocation of licenses that have been violated. We think this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>a case where even the apparently well-considered determination of the Special Term should be reversed, and an order substituted which is in accord with the truth.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">Order reversed, with costs, and order directed revoking and canceling the liquor tax certificate, with $30 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
