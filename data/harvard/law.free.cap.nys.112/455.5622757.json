The question seriously debated is the application of the ordinance under the circumstances; it being conceded that the defendant\u2019s excavation was 5 feet from the plaintiff\u2019s wall.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">The ordinance provides that where the excavation goes below 10 feet, if the other party permits entrance, it shall be the duty of the party excavating to \u201cpreserve any adjoining or contiguous wall or walls, structure or structures, from injury,\u2019\u2019 etc. The defendant urges that its excavation was not contiguous, within the meaning of the ordinance or regulation, because 5 feet away. The learned referee has entered into a careful consideration of the word and its use, as well as into the history of the provision in the Code, and reaches the conclusion that the excavation was contiguous, a conclusion which seems well within reason and authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-8\">All the words of a statute are to be given some meaning, if possible, and if it were intended to require that the walls should be adjoining there was no occasion for using the word \u201ccontiguous\u201d disjunctively, and if contiguous has a larger meaning, and the situation is within the mischief to be remedied, it is clearly within the statute. Mr. Crabb, in his English Synonyms, classifies together \u201cadjacent,\u201d \u201cadjoining,\u201d and \u201ccontiguous,\u201d and, after giving the etymology of these words, illustrates the difference between them in the following manner:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-9\">\u2018/What is adjacent may be separated by the intervention o\u00ed some third object: \u2018They have been beating up for volunteers at York, and the towns adjacent, but nobody will list\u2019\u2014Grenville. What is adjoining must touch in some part: \u2018As he happens to have no estate adjoining, equal to his own, his oppressions are often borne without resistance.\u2019\u2014Johnson. What is contiguous must be fitted to touch entirely on one side: \u2018We arrived at the utmost boundaries of a wood, which lay contiguous to a plain.\u2019\u2014Steele. Lands are adjacent to, a house or town; fields are adjoined to each other; houses contiguous to each other.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-10\">That is, the word contemplates nearness, but with intervening spaces, as between houses; and when we are contemplating a local city provision, designed to apply to city lots, with contiguous buildings, it seems entirely proper that we should hold that any wall is contiguous which is near enough to be disturbed by the excavation.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-11\">The judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-12\">Judgment affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
