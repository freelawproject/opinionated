The determination of the Supreme Court was based upon its interpretation of contract provisions and its determination that the arbitrator\u2019s findings were insufficient. Such reasoning, which \u201csecond-guesses\u201d the factual findings and legal conclusions of the arbitrator, was improper <em>(see, Matter of Troy Police Benevolent &amp; Protective Assn. [City of Troy], </em>271 AD2d 926; <em>Ingber v Statewide Ins. Co., </em>97 AD2d 397).</p><p id=\"b509-6\">However, it is apparent from the record that the arbitrator exceeded his authority <em>(see, </em>CPLR 7511 [b] [1] [iii]), by not affording the respondents an opportunity to be heard. Accordingly, the award was properly set aside <em>(see, Matter of Dandy Dan Taxi v Insurance Co., </em>155 AD2d 458). O\u2019Brien, J. P., Krausman, Goldstein, Schmidt and Crane, JJ., concur.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"
