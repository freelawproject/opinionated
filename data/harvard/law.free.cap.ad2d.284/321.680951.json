Solla et al., Appellants.</parties>\n<citation id=\"A17\">[725 NYS2d 383]</citation>\n<p id=\"AffZ\">\u2014In an action to recover damages for personal injuries, etc., the defendants appeal from so much of an order of the Supreme Court, Suffolk County (Kitson, J.), as denied that branch of their motion which was for summary judgment dismissing the cause of action based on Labor Law \u00a7 240 (1).</p>\n\n\n\n<opinion><p id=\"b361-7\">Ordered that the order is reversed insofar as appealed from, on the law, with costs, that branch of the motion which was for summary judgment dismissing the cause of action based on Labor Law \u00a7 240 (1) is granted, and that cause of action is dismissed.</p><p id=\"b361-8\">The plaintiff William Sanacore was replacing a broken fluorescent light ballast when he was hit on the head by a falling object and fell from a ladder. Contrary to the conclusion of the Supreme Court, the activity in which Sanacore was engaged when he fell constituted mere routine maintenance. Therefore, that branch of the defendants\u2019 motion which was for summary judgment dismissing the cause of action based on Labor Law \u00a7 240 (1) should have been granted <em>(see, Bermel v Board of Educ., </em>231 AD2d 663).</p><p id=\"b361-9\">In light of our determination, the defendants\u2019 remaining contention is academic and, in any event, without merit <em>(see, Thompson v Marotta, </em>256 AD2d 1124). O\u2019Brien, J. P., Altman, Luciano and Adams, JJ., concur.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"
