Walis, the plaintiffs in Action No. 2, appeal from an order of the Supreme Court, Nassau County (Martin, J.), entered July 11, 2000, which denied their motion for leave to serve a second amended complaint.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\"><p id=\"b531-4\">Ordered that the order is reversed, on the law and as a matter of discretion, without costs or disbursements, the motion is granted, and the second amended complaint is deemed served.</p><p id=\"b531-5\">The Supreme Court improvidently exercised its discretion in denying the appellants\u2019 motion for leave to serve a second amended complaint. The appellants sufficiently demonstrated the merits of their proposed pleading and the respondents failed to establish any prejudice resulting from the delay in seeking leave to amend <em>(see, Castle v Gaseteria Oil Corp., </em>263 AD2d 523; <em>Bobrowsky v Lexus, </em>215 AD2d 424). Further, the fact that the case was certified as ready for trial does not preclude an amendment of the complaint <em>(see, Barraza v Sambade, </em>212 AD2d 655).</p><p id=\"b531-6\">We decline to award costs in this case, in light of the inadequate appendix submitted by the appellants. Altman, J. P., S. Miller, Friedmann and Smith, JJ., concur.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>",
