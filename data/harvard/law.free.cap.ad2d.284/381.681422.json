Inst. [King], </em>244 AD2d 486). The unambiguous language of the agreement at issue provided that the plaintiff would be paid upon payment to the defendant from the third-party telephone company <em>(see, Matter of Wallace v 600 Partners Co., </em>86 NY2d 543, 548; <em>W. W. </em>W. <em>Assocs. v Giancontieri, </em>77 NY2d 157, 162; <em>Cannistra v Kramer &amp; Shapiro, </em>242 AD2d 653, 654; <em>see also, Menorah Nursing Home v Zukov, </em>153 AD2d 13, 20; <em>Schuler-Haas Elec. Corp. v Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., </em>49 AD2d 60, <em>affd </em>40 NY2d 883). Thus, the referee properly calculated the amount of damages in accordance with the agreement.</p><p id=\"b421-7\">Under the facts of this case, the allocation of the referee\u2019s fee between the parties was an improvident exercise of discretion. The fee should be divided equally between the parties <em>(see, H &amp; Y Realty Co. v Baron, </em>193 AD2d 429).</p><p id=\"b422-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>The plaintiffs remaining contentions are without merit. Altman, J. P., Goldstein, Friedmann and Cozier, JJ., concur.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"
