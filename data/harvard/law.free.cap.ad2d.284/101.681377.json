However, such allegations do not show conduct so wantonly dishonest and morally reprehensible as to warrant an award of punitive damages (see, <em>Rocanova v Equitable Life Assur. Socy., </em>83 NY2d 603, 613), and we accordingly modify to strike the demands therefor under the fraud causes of action. Nor were the individual defendants\u2019 alleged failure to return the individual plaintiff\u2019s telephone calls and alleged repeated false promises of payment so extreme and outrageous as to support a cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress <em>(see, Howell v New York Post Co., </em>81 NY2d 115, 121-122), and we accordingly also modify to dismiss that cause of action.
