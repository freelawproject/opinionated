A landlord is under no duty to safeguard a tenant against an attack by another tenant or his invitee if the landlord did not have the authority to control the assailant <em>(see, Adelstein v Waterview Towers, </em>250 AD2d 790; <em>Perry v Northwestern Realty Co., </em>236 AD2d 378; <em>Siino v Reices, supra). </em>Here, the defendants established that they owed no duty to the plaintiffs since the assailant was an invitee of the resident superintendent <em>(see, Provenzano v Roslyn Gardens Tenants Corp., </em>190 AD2d 718).</p><p id=\"b364-5\">Moreover, the plaintiffs\u2019 opposition papers failed to raise an issue of fact that even if the assailant could be considered an intruder, the criminal conduct was reasonably predictable based upon prior occurrences of similar criminal activity at the premises <em>(see, Novikova v Greenbriar Owners Corp., </em>258 AD2d 149; <em>Ospina v City of New York, </em>214 AD2d 551).
