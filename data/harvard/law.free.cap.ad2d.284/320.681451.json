Therefore, the Supreme Court properly dismissed the action on the ground that the plaintiffs failed to exhaust their administrative remedies (see, <em>Sloane v Annunziato, </em>234 AD2d 281).</p><p id=\"b361-4\">The plaintiffs\u2019 motion, characterized as one for reargument and renewal, was properly determined by the Supreme Court to be one for reargument (see, <em>Piacentini v Mineola Union Free School Dist., </em>279 AD2d 513). Accordingly, the appeal from the order denying that motion must be dismissed, as no appeal lies from the denial of a motion for reargument (see, <em>Piacentini v Mineola Union Free School Dist., supra).</em></p><p id=\"b361-5\">The plaintiffs\u2019 remaining contentions are without merit. Krausman, J. P., Florio, Feuerstein and Cozier, JJ., concur.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"
