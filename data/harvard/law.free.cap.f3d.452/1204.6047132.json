That conviction was imposed in 1989 by a Florida state court following a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-16\">We note at the outset that, even though Alexandre is a convicted felon, we do have jurisdiction to hear his claims on appeal because they are constitutional and legal in nature. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C), (D) (stripping us of jurisdiction to review a final removal order against an alien convicted of certain criminal offenses except to the extent that a petitioner raises a constitutional question or a question of law).</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-17\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-18\">Alexandre contends that \u00a7 106 of the REAL ID Act Pub.L. No. 109-13, 119 Stat. 231 (2005) violates the Suspension Clause of the United States Constitution because it expressly forecloses any habeas review, and a petition for review is not the equivalent of one seeking habeas corpus relief since the reviewing court is not allowed to take evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-19\">The Suspension Clause provides that \u201c[t]he Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended.\u201d U.S. Const, art. I, \u00a7 9, cl. 2. The Supreme Court has held that, \u201cthe substitution of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1206\">*1206</page-number>collateral remedy which is neither inadequate nor ineffective to test the legality of a person\u2019s detention does not constitute a suspension of the writ of habeas corpus.\u201d <em>Swain v. Pressley, </em>430 U.S. 372, 381, 97 S.Ct. 1224, 1230, 51 L.Ed.2d 411 (1977). If a substitute remedy provides the same scope of review as a habeas remedy, it is adequate and effective. <em>Id. </em>at 381-82, 97 S.Ct. at 1229-30. \u201cCongress could, without raising any constitutional questions, provide an adequate substitute through the courts of appeals.\u201d <em>Immigration and Naturalization Serv. v. St. Cyr, </em>533 U.S. 289, 314 n. 38, 121 S.Ct. 2271, 2287 150 L.Ed.2d 347 (2001). \u201cHabeas review available in \u00a7 2241 petitions by aliens challenging removal orders\u201d includes constitutional issues and errors of law, but \u201cdoes not include review of administrative fact findings or the exercise of discretion.\u201d <em>Cadet v. Bulger, </em>377 F.3d 1173, 1184 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-4\">Section 106 of the REAL ID Act amended 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a) so that a petition for review filed with the appropriate court is now an alien\u2019s exclusive means of review of a removal order. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(5), as amended by the REAL ID Act of 2005, Pub.L. No. 109-13, 119 Stat. 231 (2005). While limiting the avenues of judicial review, the REAL ID Act expanded courts of appeals\u2019 jurisdiction to consider constitutional and legal questions presented in a petition for review. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D). Congress believed that \u201c[b]y placing all review in the courts of appeals, [the REAL ID Act] would provide an \u2018adequate and effective\u2019 alternative to habeas corpus.\u201d The thinking was that the Act \u201cwould not change the scope of review that criminal aliens currently receive, because habeas review does not cover discretionary determinations or factual issues that do not implicate constitutional due process.\u201d 151 Cong. Rec. H2813-01, H2873. Because Congress gave courts of appeals jurisdiction to review all legal and constitutional errors in a removal order, habeas review became unnecessary. <em>See Balogun v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>425 F.3d 1356, 1360 (11th Cir.2005) (deciding that we had jurisdiction to review whether the BIA legally erred in determining that alien\u2019s conviction was an aggravated felony).</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-6\">We can find no fault in Congress\u2019 reasoning. Section 106 of the REAL ID Act does not violate the Suspension Clause of the Constitution because it provides, through review by a federal court of appeals, an adequate and effective remedy to test the legality of an alien\u2019s detention. Even though habeas corpus relief is precluded by the REAL ID Act, a deportable alien can still seek review of constitutional and legal claims by moving the BIA to reopen or reconsider its previous ruling, and if unsuccessful, by filing a petition for review in the court of appeals. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(e); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(5), (2)(D). This procedure offers the same review as that formerly afforded in habeas corpus which provided legal, but not factual or discretionary, determinations. <em>See Cadet, </em>377 F.3d at 1184. Since the substitute remedy of a petition for review offers the same scope of review as a habeas remedy, it is adequate and effective. <em>See Swain </em>at 381-82, 97 S.Ct. at 1229-30.</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-7\">Alexandre had the opportunity in his motion before the BIA to offer evidence to prove his eligibility for \u00a7 212(c) relief. As the BIA noted, he failed to do so. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.44(f) (noting that an alien filing a motion under this section must submit \u201csupporting documents\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-8\">Because Alexandre brought only constitutional and legal claims on appeal, it was not error for his habeas petition to be construed as a petition for review and transferred to us by the district court where he filed it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1207\">*1207</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-5\">Alexandre argues that the BIA erred as a matter of law in concluding that his \u00a7 212(c) motion to reopen was barred because he had already served five years of his sentence, and for that reason he was precluded from receiving relief based on the Immigration Act of 1990, which provided that an alien convicted of an aggravated felony who had served at least five years of his sentence could not seek a waiver of inadmissibility under then INA \u00a7 212(c), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(c). <em>See </em>Pub.L. No. 101-649, \u00a7 511(a), 104 Stat. 4978, 5052 (IMMACT-90). Alexandre argues that applying the five-year bar to him produces an impermissibly retroactive effect. We have not yet been called upon to identify the standard of review applicable to a denial of a motion to reopen brought pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.44. However, it is unnecessary for us to determine which standard of review is appropriate in this case, because Alexandre is clearly not eligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief under any standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-6\">The provisions that repealed discretionary relief from deportation under \u00a7 212(c) do not apply retroactively to an alien who pleaded guilty to criminal charges, in reliance on the possibility of \u00a7 212(c) relief, prior to the enactment of the repealer provisions. <em>St. Cyr, </em>533 U.S. at 326, 121 S.Ct. at 2293. If an alien pleaded guilty or <em>nolo contendere </em>to certain crimes before April 1, 1997, he may file a motion to reopen his deportation proceedings in order to seek \u00a7 212(c) relief. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.44. An alien is ineligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief if he has been convicted of an aggravated felony, unless he was convicted between 1990 and 1996 and served less than 5 years of his sentence, or he was convicted pursuant to a guilty plea before 1990. \u00a7\u00a7 1003.44(c), 1212.3(f)(4)(i)-(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-7\">This \u00a7 212(c) relief is not available to aliens who were convicted after a trial instead of on a guilty plea. \u00a7 1003.44(a). We have upheld, as consistent with <em>St. Cyr, </em>the distinction between aliens who pleaded guilty and those who proceeded to trial. <em>Brooks v. Ashcroft, </em>283 F.3d 1268, 1274 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-9\">The BIA did not err in finding that Alexandre was ineligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief. From the record, it is clear that Alexandre was convicted in 1989 of an aggravated felony after a jury trial and he served more than five years of his sentence. It is also clear that relief under former \u00a7 212(c) was not available to him when deportation proceedings were instituted against him in 1994 because he had served at least 5 years of his sentence. <em>See </em>IMMACT-90, \u00a7 511(a). However, the retroactivity rationale of <em>St. Cyr </em>does not apply to IM-MACT-90. Thus, at the time of his deportation proceedings, he was ineligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief because of the five-year bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-10\">Alexandre argues that the five-year bar produces an impermissible retroactive effect because he committed his crime before the statute including it was passed, but that argument was resolved in Alexan-dre\u2019s initial appeal before the BIA, and for that reason it is not properly before us now. Even if the retroactivity rationale of <em>St. Cyr </em>did apply to IMMACT-90, it would not apply to Alexandre because he did not plead guilty to his drug trafficking charges, but instead proceeded to trial and was convicted by a jury. Even without the five-year bar, the plain language of \u00a7 1003.44 also precludes those who did not plead guilty from relief. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1003.44(a); \u00a7 1212.3(f)(4)(h); <em>Brooks, </em>283 F.3d at 1274.</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-11\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1219-13\">. In September 1996, the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA) repealed \u00a7 212(c), which allowed deportable aliens to seek a waiver of inadmissibility. <em>See </em>Pub.L. No. 104-132, \u00a7 304(b), 110 Stat. 3009-546.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
