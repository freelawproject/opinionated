Greenberg (Frederic) filed a modification complaint seeking to terminate alimony payments to Suzanne Greenberg (Suzanne), his former wife. A judge of the Probate and Family Court reduced Frederic\u2019s alimony payments from $1,050 to $400 per week. We conclude that, in the circumstances of this case, Frederic\u2019s retirement was not a sufficient change in circumstances to warrant modification, and we reverse the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-15\"><em>Procedural background. </em>After a marriage of twenty-four <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>years, during which three children were born, Suzanne and Frederic were divorced by a judgment nisi that entered following trial, on December 14, 1994.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Among other things, the divorce judgment ordered Frederic to pay to Suzanne (eight years his junior and a full-time homemaker throughout most of the marriage) alimony and child support totaling $2,200 per week. Alimony in the amount of $1,500 per week was to continue \u201cfor so long as both [Frederic] and [Suzanne] are alive .... The alimony payments shall terminate upon the death or remarriage of [Suzanne], or the death of [Frederic].\u201d The judgment makes no provision for cost of living increases. Child support was subject to specified downward adjustments as each child became emancipated. See note 1, <em>supra. </em>The parties were to share equally the cost of the children\u2019s private school and college costs not covered by other sources, and the children\u2019s uninsured medical expenses (after the first $100 per year, for which Suzanne would be responsible).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\">Four years later, in February, 1999, Frederic sought a modification of his support obligations, alleging that his \u201cearned income and rental income ha[d] decreased by approximately $80,000.00 per year.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> By agreement of the parties, in September, 2000, the divorce judgment was modified and alimony reduced to $1,050 per week.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">The modification action that is the subject of this appeal was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>commenced by Frederic in April, 2004. He sought by this complaint to terminate his alimony obligation and alleged, as a material change in circumstances, that he would soon be retiring from his medical practice. After a trial, the probate judge made the following findings of fact. Frederic, who had been a physician with a specialty in ophthalmology, retired on August 31, 2004; his retirement \u201cwas a result of a confluence of health problems and certain practice problems.\u201d Since retiring, \u201cFrederic\u2019s income as proffered by his financial statement. . . shows [weekly] income from the following sources: a. Dividends and interest $322.00[;] b. Social security $416.00[;] c. Rental income $580.00[;] d. Miscellaneous $29.00[;] TOTAL $1,347.00.\u201d The parties\u2019 three children are now emancipated, the youngest graduated from college in May, 2005 (during the trial), and \u201ccertain costs for Suzanne have been reduced or eliminated.\u201d Suzanne is currently employed as an administrative assistant at Newton Wellesley Hospital, earning $830 per week; she has investment income in the amount of $206 per week.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The judge found that Suzanne could not presently access her retirement funds but that Frederic could access his retirement funds.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">The judge concluded that Frederic had failed to \u201cdemonstrate[] a material change of circumstances sufficient to justify a full termination of alimony\u201d but that his retirement from full-time employment did \u201cconstitute a material change in circumstances sufficient to allow for a reduction of his obligation.\u201d A modification judgment entered reducing alimony from $1,050 to $400 per week, and Suzanne appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">Because we conclude that the modification judgment will not permit Suzanne to meet her needs (as measured by the parties\u2019 marital standard of living), and because Frederic is able to meet <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>his support obligations (established at the time of the last modification judgment) without diminishing his capital assets or affecting his ability to maintain his standard of living, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>\u201cTo be successful in an action to modify a judgment for alimony . . . , the petitioner must demonstrate a material change of circumstances since the entry of the earlier judgment.\u201d <em>Schuler </em>v. <em>Schuler, </em>382 Mass. 366, 368 (1981). \u201cIn determining whether to modify a support or alimony order, a probate judge must weigh all relevant circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 370. Where a reduction in the alimony is sought, this includes consideration of \u201cthe financial status of the support provider, and the station in life of the respective parties,\u201d <em>ibid., </em>as well as whether, on all of the economic circumstances, the obligor spouse has \u201cthe present ability to pay the amounts required by the agreement and judgment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 375-376. \u201cA substantial and permanent decrease in the income of the support provider is one of the material circumstances to be considered in a request for reduction of a support reward. . . . However, while a substantial decrease in income or financial status may warrant a modification, such a decrease does not alone compel a modification.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 370-371. The judge must \u201ckeep in mind \u2018the fundamental purpose of alimony: to provide economic support to the dependent spouse.\u2019 \u201d <em>Katz </em>v. <em>Katz, </em>55 Mass. App. Ct. 472, 478 (2002), quoting from <em>Gottsegen </em>v. <em>Gottsegen, </em>397 Mass. 617, 623 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">A dependent spouse\u2019s support needs, whether at the point of initial determination or later, when a modification is sought, are to be \u201cmeasured by the \u2018station\u2019' of the parties \u2014 by what is required to maintain a standard of living comparable to the one enjoyed during the marriage.\u201d <em>Grubert </em>v. <em>Grubert, </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. 811, 819 (1985), and cases cited. See <em>Cooper </em>v. <em>Cooper, </em>62 Mass. App. Ct. 130, 138 (2004) (in modification action, judge properly focused on parties\u2019 marital lifestyle in assessing wife\u2019s current needs). Cf. G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 34 (enumerating factors affecting equitable distribution of property and award of alimony on divorce).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">We undertake our review in light of the foregoing principles, recognizing that \u201cin fashioning an appropriate modification judgment, the probate judge enjoys considerable discretion, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>the judgment will not be reversed unless it is \u2018plainly wrong.\u2019 . . . This standard is deferential to a judge\u2019s decision, but that deference is not without limit.\u201d <em>Cooper, supra </em>at 134, quoting from <em>Schuler, supra </em>at 368. It would constitute an abuse of discretion if findings of fact were not supported by the record or conclusions failed to reflect consideration of applicable legal principles. See <em>Rosenberg </em>v. <em>Merida, </em>428 Mass. 182, 189 (1998) (reversal in absence of findings concerning support amount in modification action, \u201c[bjecause ... we cannot determine if the judge followed the approach that we have prescribed here\u201d); <em>Freedman </em>v. <em>Freedman, </em>49 Mass. App. Ct. 519, 521 (2000) (\u201c[e]rror of law apparent on the record, such as the failure of a judge\u2019s findings to support the judge\u2019s action,\u201d constitutes an abuse of discretion). The \u201c\u00a1judge\u2019s] reasoning and the basis of his decision[s]\u201d must be apparent in his findings and rulings. See <em>Trenz </em>v. <em>Norwell, ante </em>271, 277-278 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">Because unchallenged evidence establishes that Frederic has the ability to meet his alimony obligations from income generated by his retirement assets (which he has chosen not to draw on for the time being) or out of investment assets (which he currently uses to meet his own expenses), without affecting his own standard of living, the fact that he has retired is not a sufficient basis to reduce the alimony award. See <em>Schuler, </em>382 Mass. at 376; <em>Barron </em>v. <em>Barron, </em>28 Mass. App. Ct. 755, 759 (1990); <em>Katz, </em>55 Mass. App. Ct. at 481. This is especially true where, as here, \u201chis [former] wife\u2019s expenses and income have not changed.\u201d <em>Schuler, supra </em>at 372.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">1. <em>Frederic\u2019s financial circumstances. </em>The judge made no finding as to the value of Frederic\u2019s assets or the potential income to be derived from his substantial retirement funds, and we therefore cannot say that the judge gave appropriate consideration to this important factor in deciding as he did. The parties are in agreement that Frederic\u2019s assets at the time of the present modification trial included nearly $2 million in retirement accounts and just under $900,000 in cash and investment accounts; the total value of all his assets was $3,135,182, including an office condominium allocated to him by the divorce judgment. It is also not disputed that since the prior modification in 2000, Frederic\u2019s retirement accounts have appreciated, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>without additional contribution from him, at an average annual rate of twelve per cent per year. Frederic testified that he has elected not to draw on his retirement funds (all currently invested in various individual retirement accounts) to supplement his weekly income of $1,347 and that he intended to do so but had not decided when or in what amounts.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The judge found that Frederic was currently able to draw upon his retirement. Frederic\u2019s expenses (exclusive of alimony, child support, and education costs) are about $1,365 per week.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> He lists no liabilities. In reducing alimony, the judge makes no finding that the $1,050 weekly alimony payment cannot be met without depleting (or even diminishing) Frederic\u2019s assets or adversely affecting his standard of living, and nothing in the evidence would support such a finding.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\">It is also relevant as part of an over-all assessment of the par<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>ties\u2019 financial circumstances that, when alimony was reduced in 2000, Suzanne commenced full-time employment and incurred mortgage loans in excess of $250,000 in order to meet her needs and those of the children. At the same time that Frederic was paying $23,400 less in annual alimony (as well as reduced child support as the children became emancipated), his income in each of the three years following entry of the 2000 modification judgment was, on average, well over $100,000 per year more than it was when he sought a reduction in his support obligations. Cf. <em>Huddleston </em>v. <em>Huddleston, </em>51 Mass. App. Ct. 563, 565 (2001) (proper to increase alimony where findings reflected that husband\u2019s income immediately following divorce far exceeded $80,000 in annual earnings he anticipated earning as result of \u201creduced pace\u201d).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">It was, as we have said, Frederic\u2019s burden to establish that a material change in his circumstances prevented him from meeting his current alimony obligations out of income and assets. See <em>Schuler, </em>382 Mass. at 368. There was unchallenged evidence that his individual retirement accounts had been appreciating at the rate of some twelve per cent per year for the past four years. At one-half that rate, the interest income from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>his retirement accounts would be in excess of $2,000 per week. The ineluctable conclusion to be drawn from these facts, as well as from evidence of the value of Frederic\u2019s other assets, is that Frederic has sufficient financial resources to meet his alimony obligations in the amount of $1,050 per week, as well as his own needs.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> See <em>Pagar </em>v. Pagar, 9 Mass. App. Ct. 1, 7 (1980), quoting from <em>Kay </em>v. <em>Kay, </em>37 N.Y.2d 632, 636 (1975) (\u201c[A]s to alimony . . . , if it were necessary for the husband here to utilize his capital or other assets, they would not be exempt from the requirement that he maintain the marital standard of living simply because he voluntarily maintains his finances in a form that limits the income they produce\u201d). See also <em>Binder </em>v. <em>Binder, </em>7 Mass. App. Ct. 751, 755 (1979) (no changed circumstances where wife\u2019s needs and husband\u2019s income unchanged, taking into account direct and indirect compensation as well as increased net worth); <em>Wolfe </em>v. <em>Wolfe, </em>21 Mass. App. Ct. 254, 257 (1985) (\u201cprobate judge need not undertake to direct specifically what the source of the ordered payments shall be\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">2. <em>Suzanne\u2019s financial circumstances. </em>Suzanne\u2019s needs have not materially altered since the entry of the earlier modification judgment. Although the judge found that \u201ccertain\u201d of Suzanne\u2019s expenses would be reduced now that the youngest was emancipated, he did not find by how much. Frederic did not challenge evidence that Suzanne\u2019s current weekly expenses, exclusive of child-related costs, are $2,622 per week (including $99 in deductions from income for medical, dental, disability, and life insurance costs). At the time of the 2000 modification, when two children were not yet emancipated, Suzanne\u2019s expenses were $2,428 per week; child-related expenses added $502.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">Nor has Suzanne\u2019s income increased materially. In 2000, she was earning $304 per week working part time as an assistant curator; with interest income, child support, and alimony, her total weekly income was $2,712. At the time of the trial on this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>modification complaint, Suzanne was earning $830 per week (from which was deducted $402 for tax withholding; medical, dental and life insurance; and similar deductions) from full-time employment as an administrative assistant; she had $206 in interest income. With alimony reduced to $400 per week, and no child support, the gap between Suzanne\u2019s available income and expenses is $1,186 per week, or $61,672 per year.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">The judge made no finding (nor could he) that Suzanne\u2019s current expenses are inconsistent with the standard of living the parties enjoyed during the marriage.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> That standard includes the real estate, capital assets, and pensions allocated to each party in the divorce judgment (and from which, according to findings issued by the judge presiding over the divorce, the wife could expect to derive income). Twelve years ago, at the time of the divorce, the $2,200 weekly support award plus investment income permitted Suzanne to meet her needs without depleting her assets or seeking employment.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Nothing in the parties\u2019 current, over-all financial circumstances supports a conclusion that Suzanne can now meet her current needs (as defined by the marital standard of living) without depleting as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>sets allocated to her as part of the divorce judgment or reducing her standard of living.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">There is also no finding, nor evidence to suggest, that Suzanne will be able to earn more than she does currently. \u201cShe shares with the husband the limitations age places upon one\u2019s ability to continue to earn income. What future security which is available to her from her assets will quickly be lost when her alimony ends.\u201d <em>Barron </em>v. <em>Barron, </em>28 Mass. App. Ct. at 759. The judgment requires that the $75,452 annual shortfall be made up, at least until Suzanne retires, by resort to her assets; this will likely deplete her cash and investment accounts and reduce the value of her retirement accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">A reduction in alimony is not justified by the finding that Suzanne now earns $830 per week from employment. That income will be available to her at some point from her retirement accounts is not a permissible basis upon which to make the present modification in the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">3. <em>Other issues. </em>We disagree with Frederic that the modification in 2000 supersedes the provision in the divorce judgment that provides for continuation of alimony until Frederic\u2019s death, Suzanne\u2019s death, or her remarriage. All that was modified was the amount of the alimony obligation. Based on that modification judgment, and because Suzanne did not here seek an increase (either to account for inflation or to resume prior levels of alimony when Frederic\u2019s income increased), the sole issue at the trial on the within complaint was whether a further reduction in alimony was warranted because of material changes in the parties\u2019 circumstances occurring since the prior modification judgment. As our earlier discussion of relevant cases indicates, measuring a change in the parties\u2019 circumstances since the prior judgment does not take place in a vacuum, but occurs against the backdrop of the parties\u2019 station in fife when married.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\"><em>Conclusion. </em>Neither the findings nor the uncontroverted evidence support the conclusion that there was a change in the parties\u2019 circumstances justifying a downward modification in Frederic\u2019s alimony obligation. Frederic\u2019s, request for double costs and attorney\u2019s fees related to this appeal is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-8\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b373-6\">The judgment was amended on January 10, 1995, on joint motion of the parties, to reflect that Frederic\u2019s child support payments to Suzanne, who had custody, would be reduced from $700 per week to $500 per week upon emancipation of the first child, and to $400 when the second became emancipated. It would terminate altogether when the youngest became emancipated (an event that occurred prior to the end of the trial on this modification complaint).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b373-7\">Frederic claimed that as a further material change in circumstances, the parties\u2019 oldest child was emancipated. The modification action was resolved by an agreement of the parties, dated July 27, 2000, that provided that \u201cparagraph 14 [of the judgment relating to alimony] shall remain the same in all respects except alimony is changed from $1,500 per week to $1050 per week effective 7-28-2000\u201d; it was further agreed that Suzanne would make a gift to the parties\u2019 daughter of $10,000 in the year 2000 and $10,000 in the year 2001. The divorce judgment was otherwise unchanged. The parties\u2019 agreement was, by amended modification judgment dated September 13, 2000, merged in the judgment and does \u201cnot survive and have independent legal significance.\u201d See <em>Huddleston </em>v. <em>Huddleston, </em>51 Mass. App. Ct. 563, 564 n.2 (2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b374-6\">The judge also included in Suzanne\u2019s income weekly child support the sum of $250, a number drawn from her financial statements. According to the judgment of divorce, as amended, the amount of the weekly child support obligation was $400, see note 1, <em>supra-, </em>according to Frederic\u2019s testimony and financial statements, see note 6, <em>infra, </em>he was making child support payments in the amount of $375 per week at the start of trial. Whatever the actual amount being paid, all child support terminated on the youngest child\u2019s emancipation during trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b374-7\">Frederic reached age sixty-five on October 14, 2004.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b377-5\">To questions on cross-examination regarding his retirement, Frederic responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-6\"><em>Q: </em>\u201cDo you intend on taking anything out of those retirement vehicles, Doctor, at any time post-retirement, after retirement?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-8\">A: \u201cI intend to at some point.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-9\"><em>Q: </em>\u201cHave you made a decision, Doctor, as to how much you would be taking out?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-11\">A: \u201cI have not.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-12\"><em>Q: </em>\u201cWhen, Doctor, are you going to start taking some of the income or appreciation from your [individual retirement accounts]?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-14\">A: \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b377-15\">Pressed to answer why he had not made the decision as to when he would begin to access retirement funds, Frederic answered: \u201cI have no need to make a decision yet at this time. ... I have enough money in the bank for now.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b377-16\">Frederic\u2019s expenses are set forth on financial statements submitted during the proceedings. While unchallenged, mistakes in the entries are apparent. On one form, consistent with Frederic\u2019s testimony, \u201c$375.00\u201d is inserted as the amount of weekly child support; on others \u201c$0.00\u201d is inserted and \u201c$375.00\u201d appears on the line above (for cable television); on another, \u201c$375.00\u201d is inserted (for the first time) as the weekly amount for vacation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b377-17\">Nor does the judge\u2019s stated rationale reflect a sufficient basis for the reduction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-18\">\u201cThe reason that the Court will not terminate the obligation rests primarily in the age disparity between the parties, the fact that. . .

However, the issue before the Court relates to the present change in circumstances and not some hypothetical future event.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b378-13\">The impact of the prior reduction in alimony on Frederic\u2019s current economic health is reflected in the fact that, by the time of the current modification action, he had no debts, whereas at the time of the 2000 modification he had over $80,000 in liabilities. His liquid assets significantly increased in value during this time frame: nonretirement cash and investments increased by more than $200,000 (from a value of $744,674 in 2000 to a high of $957,024), and retirement assets increased by nearly $700,000 (from $1,254,265 in 2000, to $1,952,067 in 2005). Increases in the value of Suzanne\u2019s liquid assets were modest in comparison. Her cash and nonretirement investments increased by less than $60,000 (from $616,353 to $675,499); retirement assets increased by less than $43,000 (from $1,498,750 in 2000 to $1,541,689 at the time of the within modification action).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b379-7\">That Frederic\u2019s expenses are currently less than Suzanne\u2019s does not affect our outcome; Frederic is not required to spend less, and in light of the income generated by his retirement accounts, he could meet his $1,050 weekly alimony obligations while increasing his own expenses by at least $1,000.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b380-5\">We have exercised discretion and obtained a copy of the findings of fact issued in support of the divorce judgment, which was not included in the record appendix. These findings reflect that during the marriage, \u201c[t]he husband and wife lived an upper middle class station in life. They had a nice home in Newton. They scheduled one vacation trip per year to such places as Greece, England, Mexico, Disney World, [and] white water rafting in Colorado. They ate out four to five times per month. The children are all attending private schools.\" The judge found that Suzanne\u2019s \u201creasonable needs can be met on the combination of child support and alimony provided for in the judgment.\u201d In <em>Greenberg </em>v. <em>Greenberg, </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. 1101 (1996), an unpublished memorandum and order issued pursuant to our rule 1:28, we affirmed the divorce judgment and held that the judge, in making financial allocations under G.

Suzanne still lives in the former marital home (which has substantially increased in value; the current net equity totals $827,397), and continues to use the income from investments (currently valued at $670,652) to meet expenses.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
