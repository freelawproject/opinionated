The plaintiffs (abutters) appealed that decision to Superior Court pursuant to G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 21 (abutters\u2019 appeal). The developers appealed the same decision to the Housing Appeals Committee (HAC), G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 22 (HAC appeal). After the HAC acted on the developers\u2019 appeal, the abutters appealed that HAC decision to Superior Court pursuant to G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 22, and G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14. After the judge granted the developers\u2019 motion for summary judgment in the abutters\u2019 appeal, the abutters appealed to this court. This case requires us to construe the relationship between the abutters\u2019 and the developers\u2019 separate rights when each appeals the same decision of the local board pursuant to G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 21, and G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 22, of the Low and Moderate Income Housing Act (Act),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\"><em>Comprehensive permitting. </em>The general statutory scheme governing applications for comprehensive permits pursuant to the Act is described by the Supreme Judicial Court in <em>Board of Appeals of Hanover </em>v. <em>Housing Appeals Comm., </em>363 Mass. 339, 345-346 (1973). See <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Wellesley </em>v. <em>Ardemore Apts. Ltd. Partnership, </em>436 Mass. 811, 814-816 (2002). Accordingly, we set forth the relevant portions of the Act only briefly.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">In an effort to provide a streamlined process for the issuance of permits required to construct affordable housing and to avoid the lengthy delays that sometimes pervade the permitting process, see <em>Milton Commons Assocs. </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Milton, </em>14 Mass. App. Ct. 111, 117 (1982), G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7\u00a7 20-23, allows \u201cqualified builder[s] wishing to build low or moderate income housing [to] file with a local board of appeals an application for a comprehensive permit instead of filing separate applications with each local agency having jurisdiction over the project.\u201d <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Wellesley </em>v. <em>Housing Appeals Comm., </em>385 Mass. 651, 656 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">If the local zoning board approves the application, but does so with conditions that a developer alleges render the project uneconomic, or if the board denies the permit in its entirety, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 22, provides that developer with a right of appeal to the HAC.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> *6See <em>Board of Appeals of Hanover </em>v. <em>Housing Appeals Comm., supra </em>at 345. When, as here, a developer appeals the issuance of a permit with conditions, the HAC\u2019s review is limited to determining \u201cwhether such conditions and requirements make the construction or operation of such housing uneconomic and whether they are consistent with local needs.\u201d G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 23. At its discretion, the HAC \u201cmay allow any person showing that he or she may be substantially and specifically affected by the proceedings to intervene as a party in the whole or in any portion of the proceedings.\u201d 760 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 30.04(2) (2004). If the HAC concludes that a board\u2019s conditions to approval render the project uneconomic and inconsistent with local needs, \u201cit shall order such board to modify or remove any such condition or requirement so as to make the proposal no longer uneconomic and to issue any necessary permit or approval.\u201d G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 23. The HAC decision may be reviewed in Superior Court in accordance with G. L. c. 30A. G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">In contrast, an abutter or other party aggrieved by the issuance of a comprehensive permit or approval may appeal to a court pursuant to the zoning appeal procedures provided for in G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 17<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (\u00a7 17 appeal) rather than to an administra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>live agency. G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 21. The \u00a7 17 appeal contains abbreviated notice provisions in order \u201c[t]o avoid delay,\u201d and the court is required to hear, without jury, \u201call evidence pertinent to the authority of the board\u201d and to \u201cdetermine the facts, and, upon the facts as so determined, annul such decision if found to exceed the authority of such board ... or make such other decree as justice and equity may require.\u201d G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 17. The statute provides that \u201cthe parties shall have all rights of appeal and exception as in other equity cases.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Finally, the statute provides that \u201c[a]ll issues in any proceeding under [\u00a7 17] shall have precedence over all other civil actions and proceedings.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">The Act, therefore, creates two separate appeal mechanisms, and the relevant mechanism to be employed in a given situation is dependent upon the identity of the appealing party. For aggrieved parties such as the abutters here, a right of appeal is provided to the courts. Permit applicants, by contrast, must appeal to a specialized administrative tribunal, the HAC. This case requires us to consider how these two distinct avenues of appeal interact when, as here, both the abutters and the developers timely exercise their statutory rights to appeal, and both parties challenge the same action of the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\"><em>Background facts and proceedings. </em>Given their relevance to our disposition, the factual background and procedural history of the dispute must be set forth in some detail. On January 31, 2002, the developers applied to the board for a comprehensive permit to construct forty-eight units of residential housing (project) on land located at 536-540 Lowell Street in Lexington. The permit application was filed pursuant to G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7\u00a7 20-23.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Public hearing commenced on March 14, 2002, and continued through December 12, 2002. On or about July 31, 2002, the developers submitted a revised application, reducing the number of proposed units from forty-eight to thirty-six.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">On January 23, 2003, the board issued a comprehensive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>permit with conditions, including a reduction in the number of units from thirty-six to twenty-eight, and a mandate that eight of those twenty-eight units be designated for persons with low or moderate incomes as determined by Massachusetts Housing Finance Agency (MHFA) guidelines.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The developers appealed to the HAC pursuant to G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 22, while the abutters appealed that same decision to Superior Court pursuant to G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 21. On March 31, 2003, a Superior Court judge granted the parties\u2019 assented-to motion to stay the abutters\u2019 appeal pending disposition of the HAC appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">Meanwhile on March 19, 2003, the abutters moved to intervene in the HAC appeal. Although their motion was not ruled upon until the HAC issued its decision on June 14, 2005, the abutters, through counsel, were permitted to participate in the HAC proceedings as amici.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The HAC conducted nine days of de nova evidentiary hearings. Ultimately, the HAC approved the developers\u2019 comprehensive permit application to build thirty-six units, designating nine as affordable, and striking some of the conditions imposed by the board. The abutters appealed the HAC decision pursuant to G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 22, and G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14. That appeal is now pending in Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">After obtaining the aforesaid decision from the HAC, the developers filed a motion for summary judgment on October 19, 2005, seeking to dismiss the abutters\u2019 appeal. The developers asserted that the comprehensive permit originally issued by the board, which was the subject of the abutters\u2019 appeal, was no longer operative and had been extinguished and superseded by a different comprehensive permit bearing the modifications imposed by the HAC. The judge accepted this analysis and concluded that the HAC modification decision rendered the abutters\u2019 appeal moot, and that the abutters\u2019 only available <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>vehicle for redress was the administrative appeal pursuant to G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14. In support of the compression of both appeals into one c. 30A administrative appeal, the judge reasoned that \u201cboth 40A [the abutters] and 40B [the developers] appellants are treated equally with the same de nova standard of review,\u201d and that \u201conce the HAC determines that the Board\u2019s decision is \u2018consistent with local needs\u2019 and \u2018not otherwise uneconomic,\u2019 its final decision is binding for both appeals under chapters 40A and 40B.\u201d The judge further reasoned that permitting the abutters\u2019 appeal to proceed could allow communities to engage in exclusionary zoning<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> practices that the Act was intended to prevent. Accordingly, the judge granted the developers\u2019 motion for summary judgment, dismissing the abutters\u2019 appeal. This appeal followed. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">On appeal, the abutters argue that the judge erred in allowing the developers\u2019 motion for summary judgment both because genuine issues of material fact are extant, and because it was error to conclude that their G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 21, appeal to the Superior Court was mooted by the decision of the HAC.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\"><em>Summary judgment standard. </em>A motion for summary judgment should be granted \u201cif the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and responses to request for admission under [Mass.R.Civ.P. 36, 365 Mass. 795 (1974)], together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Mass.R.Civ.P. 56, 365 Mass. 824 (1974). The developers, as moving parties, have the burden of establishing \u201cthat there are no material issues of fact and that [it] is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Highlands Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Aerovox, Inc., </em>424 Mass. 226, 232 (1997). On appeal, \u201c[a]n <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>order granting or denying summary judgment will be upheld if the trial judge ruled on undisputed material facts and his ruling was correct as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>One 1987 Mercury Cougar Auto., </em>413 Mass. 534, 536 (1992). \u201cAll the grounds underlying the [developers\u2019] motion are open for appellate review.\u201d <em>Gallant </em>v. <em>Worcester, </em>383 Mass. 707, 709 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b537-4\"><em>Discussion. </em>The judge concluded that the entirety of the abutters\u2019 appeal was moot as matter of law, and thus he did not address their assertion of the existence of genuine issues of material fact. Given this basis for the court\u2019s allowance of the developers\u2019 motion, we must address the somewhat perplexing question of the interaction between an abutter\u2019s appeal filed directly in Superior Court and a developer\u2019s appeal filed initially with the HAC and then subject to further judicial review in Superior Court under G. L. c. 30A.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">In the appeal before this court, the two sides advance different theories of how appellate rights are to be pursued when there are concurrent proceedings in Superior Court and before the HAC. The developers urge that the appropriate analysis is relatively simplistic, that is, when a modified comprehensive permit is issued by the HAC, a rather mechanical mootness analysis applies, i.e., the abutters\u2019 appeal directed at the original permit is per se mooted because there is in effect a \u201cnew\u201d comprehensive permit, with different terms and conditions. In contrast, the abutters assert that there are more complex matters at hand that involve different standards of review, less fulsome rights of intervention and varying legal challenges available in one venue of appeal, but not in the other. The abutters contend that the procedural and jurisdictional distinctions between the two mechanisms for appeal, as well as the deferential standard of review applicable in G. L. c. 30A judicial review of the HAC \u201cadministrative\u201d decision, make clear that participation in a HAC proceeding does not provide the procedural and substantive protections afforded an aggrieved abutter under a zoning appeal litigated in Superior Court pursuant to G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">We turn then to the differing rights of appellate review extant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>under G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 17, zoning appeals to the Superior Court (as provided for in G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 21) and administrative appeals to the HAC followed by review in Superior Court as provided for in G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 22, and G. L. c. 30A.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">We begin with the point that the Act does indeed provide for two distinct avenues of appeal. While developers may challenge unfavorable zoning board decisions in the HAC, \u201cpersons aggrieved\u201d may pursue relief only in the courts. See G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7\u00a7 21-22; G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 17. Both routes of appeal permit de nova review of the board\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Wellesley </em>v. <em>Ardemore Apts. Ltd. Partnership, </em>436 Mass. at 815; <em>Landers </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Falmouth, </em>31 Mass. App. Ct. 939, 940 (1991); <em>Board of Appeals of Hanover </em>v. <em>Housing Appeals Comm., </em>363 Mass. at 369-371. Given the explicit statutory provision of a right to judicial appeal and review for aggrieved parties, on the facts and circumstances of this case we determine as matter of law that judicial review for these abutters, provided explicitly by statute, is not per se mooted by the developers\u2019 expeditious appeal to the HAC and that body\u2019s determination that a revised comprehensive permit is to issue. Although not controlling, the fact that the extent of an abutter\u2019s participation in HAC proceedings differs in some respects from an appeal to the court, provides additional support for our ruling in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">To hold (as the developers urge) that the abutters\u2019 appeal is automatically rendered moot by the HAC\u2019s modification of the original permit effectively renders a statutory enactment, the provision in G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 21, of a right to appeal for persons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>aggrieved, a nullity. Application of the statute in this way constitutes a distinct departure from well settled rules of statutory construction. Indeed, \u201c[a] basic tenet of statutory construction requires that a statute be construed so that effect is given to all its provisions, so that no part will be inoperative or superfluous.\u201d <em>Wolfe </em>v. <em>Gormally, </em>440 Mass. 699, 704 (2004) (quotations omitted). See <em>Volin </em>v. <em>Board of Pub. Accountancy, </em>422 Mass. 175, 179 (1996), quoting from <em>Adamowicz </em>v. <em>Ipswich, </em>395 Mass. 757, 760 (1985) (\u201cWe do not \u2018interpret a statute so as to render it or any portion of it meaningless\u2019 \u201d). Relatedly, it is clear that a court may not ignore a statute\u2019s plain words.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>Shabshelowitz </em>v. <em>Fall River Gas Co., </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. 769, 773-774 (1991), <em>S.C., </em>412 Mass. 259 (1992) (\u201cWe cannot ignore any provision of a statute when we are engaged in the interpretation of a legislative enactment\u201d); <em>Hollum </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>53 Mass. App. Ct. 220, 225 (2001). With these principles in mind, we cannot disregard the Legislature\u2019s insistence that those parties constituting \u201cpersons aggrieved\u201d pursuant to G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7\u00a7 20-21, are entitled, literally, to their day in court.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">Furthermore, the differences between zoning appeals to the courts under G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 17, and administrative appeals to the HAC, followed by an appeal pursuant to G. L. c. 30A, are not insignificant.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We discuss three such differences for illustrative purposes here. First, \u201c[t]he Committee, as provided in [G. L.] c. 30A, \u00a7 11, need not follow the rules of evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>observed by the courts . . . .\u201d 760 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 30.10 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">Second, although parties such as the abutters here may be permitted to intervene in an HAC proceeding, intervention is allowed at the discretion of the presiding officer<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and is not permitted when a proposed intervener\u2019s \u201cinterests are substantially similar to those of any party and no showing is made that one or more of the parties will not diligently represent those interests.\u201d 760 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 30.04(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">Third, when a zoning board grants a comprehensive permit but attaches conditions thereto, the HAC\u2019s review is confined to a determination whether the conditions imposed by the zoning board render the proposed development uneconomic, and whether those conditions are consistent with local needs. G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 23. See, e.g., <em>Board of Appeals of Hanover </em>v. <em>Housing Appeals Comm., supra </em>at 346. When permitted to intervene in HAC proceedings, aggrieved persons are thus limited to addressing only these two questions. Further, additional limitations on the scope of a party\u2019s intervention may be imposed by the presiding officer at her discretion. See 760 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 30.04(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">By contrast, while the local need for affordable housing is certainly relevant in an appeal filed by an abutter or other aggrieved person under G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 17 (as directed by G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 21), no statutory or regulatory language limits such an appeal to the narrow questions whether conditions are uneconomic and inconsistent with local needs.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">Such distinctions between the G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 21, and G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 22, appeals, and most importantly the unambiguous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>statutory provision of the right of aggrieved persons to appeal to a judicial forum, mandate that the abutters\u2019 right to an appeal in Superior Court cannot be mooted here.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">We are mindful of the developers\u2019 concern that allowing the abutters\u2019 appeal to proceed could, in some cases, impede the statutory purpose of creating affordable housing without undue delay. As the Supreme Judicial Court has stated, \u201cthe Legislature\u2019s intent in passing [the Act] was to provide relief from exclusionary zoning practices which prevented the construction of badly needed low and moderate income housing.\u201d <em>Board of Appeals of Hanover </em>v. <em>Housing Appeals Comm., supra </em>at 353-354. See, e.g., <em>Dennis Hous. Corp. </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Dennis, </em>439 Mass. 71, 76 (2003). \u201cIn addition to streamlining the permitting process itself, the clear intent of the Legislature was to promote affordable housing by minimizing lengthy and expensive delays occasioned by court battles commenced by those seeking to exclude affordable housing from their own neighborhoods.\u201d <em>Standerwick </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Andover, </em>447 Mass. at 29. See <em>Milton Commons Assocs. </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Milton, </em>14 Mass. App. Ct. at 118 (noting \u201cthe legislative intent to effect an expedited procedure\u201d). Yet, effectuation of the Act\u2019s purpose of providing affordable housing is not limitless. For example, \u201cthe interest in the provision of critically needed affordable housing must be balanced against the statutorily authorized interests in the protection of the safety and health of the town\u2019s residents, development of improved site and building design, and preservation of open space.\u201d <em>Standerwick </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Andover, supra </em>at 31. The abutters\u2019 statutorily authorized right to appeal must likewise be balanced against the Act\u2019s principle objective. Indeed, while crafting legislation primarily aimed at alleviating the Commonwealth\u2019s affordable housing crisis, see <em>Board of Appeals of Hanover </em>v. <em>Housing Appeals Comm., supra </em>at 349 (referencing Report of the Legislative Research Council relative to Restricting the Zoning Power to City and County Governments, 1968 Senate No. 1133), within the same statute the Legislature also provided both developers and aggrieved persons with the ability to appeal. See G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7\u00a7 20-23.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">There can be no doubt that the realization of both parties\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>rights to appeal may result in additional time between a developer\u2019s application for a comprehensive permit and the ultimate creation of affordable housing when such a permit is granted. But, in a case such as this, where there is no indication that the abutters\u2019 claims are being pursued in bad faith or for dilatory purposes, their statutory right to appeal in a judicial tribunal cannot be eliminated by the HAC\u2019s order that a revised permit issue. We are also not disposed to accept the assertion that delay in such cases is inevitable, especially when the parties cooperate with the judge in the manner that is both suggested and required by the remand in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">Because the Act may be interpreted in a way that renders the provision of an aggrieved party\u2019s right to appeal ineffective only if it is impossible to provide \u201ca construction that would lead to a logical and sensible result,\u201d see <em>Adamowicz </em>v. <em>Ipswich, </em>395 Mass. at 760, quoting from <em>Lexington </em>v. <em>Bedford, </em>378 Mass. 562, 570 (1979), and given that there has been no adequate showing of impossibility here, it was error for the court to conclude that the HAC decision mooted the abutters\u2019 right to appeal. The case is therefore remanded for further consideration in light of this opinion.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">We note that the HAC directed the board to issue an amended comprehensive permit, and that because the HAC\u2019s order was not acted upon by the board within thirty days, that order is now deemed the action of the board. See G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 23. The developers assert that if the abutters pursue a judicial appeal of the board\u2019s grant of the original comprehensive permit now that the HAC has ordered modification of that permit, either the abutters\u2019 appeal or the HAC decision is rendered futile and could result in wasted judicial or administrative resources. However, because we hold that on the facts and circumstances of this case the abutters\u2019 right to judicial appeal is not destroyed by the developers\u2019 success in obtaining a modified permit in the HAC, the fact that the version of the permit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>emerging from the HAC is different from that originally issued by the board does not annihilate the abutters\u2019 appeal rights pursuant to G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">On remand, the parties may wish to assist the court by providing suggestions as to how both parties\u2019 rights to appeal may be effectuated meaningfully and without jeopardizing the important interests of creating affordable housing and furthering judicial efficiency. For example, the abutters suggest that they could amend the complaint in their G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 21, appeal to reflect changes to the comprehensive permit as it emerged from the HAC, and that the Superior Court could stay that appeal pending disposition of their G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14, appeal of the HAC decision. Further consideration of this matter on remand might be greatly facilitated by the parties\u2019 participation in a conference pursuant to Mass.R.Civ.P. 16, 365 Mass. 764 (1974),<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and a consolidation of the two Superior Court actions. We leave the creative problem solving to the parties, in the first instance, in the context of their cases.

A combination of zoning measures such as \u201cminimum lot size requirements, green space zoning, minimum frontage and setback requirements . . . [and] building height limitations\u201d may result in such exclusionary zoning. See <em>Board of Appeals of Hanover </em>v. <em>Housing Appeals Comm., supra </em>at 348.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b538-7\">By contrast, when a party appeals from a decision of the HAC pursuant to G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14, the administrative body\u2019s decision \u201cmust be upheld if it is supported by substantial evidence. Substantial evidence is such evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Wellesley </em>v. <em>Housing Appeals Comm., </em>385 Mass. at 657. See G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 1(6). Given the deference to be paid to the agency\u2019s findings and rulings, this review is markedly different from the depth of review provided by a trial de nova. See <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Wellesley </em>v. <em>Housing Appeals Comm., supra </em>at 657. Thus, the G. L. c. 30A appeal of an abutter permitted to intervene in a HAC proceeding cannot be characterized as affording the abutter with judicial review equal to that afforded by G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 21, and G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 17.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b539-6\">This rule is related to the notion that we must construe the statute in its entirety, \u201c[so] that no clause, sentence or word shall prove superfluous, void or insignificant, if, by any other construction they may all be made useful and pertinent.\u201d <em>Board of Appeals of Hanover </em>v. <em>Housing Appeals Comm., supra </em>at 364, quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McCaughey, 9 </em>Gray 296, 297 (1857).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b539-7\">While the Supreme Judicial Court has observed that \u201cthere are no substantial differences between the alternative methods of review,\u201d this statement was made in the limited context of assessing whether the two routes of appeal violate Federal and State equal protection guarantees. <em>Board of Appeals of Hanover </em>v. <em>Housing Appeals Comm., supra </em>at 371. See <em>Mahoney </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Winchester, </em>366 Mass. 228, 231-232 (1974). Further, this equal protection challenge \u201cwas premised upon the view that the hearing before the committee,\u201d unlike that in the court, was not de nova. <em>Board of Appeals of Hanover </em>v. <em>Housing Appeals Comm., supra </em>at 371.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b540-9\">The Supreme Judicial Court \u201chas repeatedly recognized that agencies have broad discretion to grant or deny intervention.\u201d <em>Tofias </em>v. <em>Energy Facilities Siting Bd., </em>435 Mass. 340, 346 (2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b540-10\">Indeed, while effectuation of the purposes of the Act requires that the term \u201cpersons aggrieved\u201d as appearing in G. L. c. 40B be construed more narrowly than the identical term appearing in G. L. c. 40A, such individuals have standing to pursue G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 21, appeals if they posit \u201ca plausible claim of a definite violation of a private right, a private property interest, or a private legal interest\u201d that is protected by the statute pursuant to which the plaintiff claims he or she is aggrieved. See <em>Standerwick </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Andover, </em>447 Mass. at 27-29, quoting from <em>Harvard Sq. Defense Fund, Inc. </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Cambridge, </em>27 Mass.

L. c. 40B, \u00a7 21, was moot, the judge did not reach the abutters\u2019 assertion that the existence of genuine issues of material fact precludes entry of summary judgment for the developers. Accordingly, we decline to reach that contention here, and it remains properly before the court on remand.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b543-6\">In relevant part, rule 16 provides that: \u201cIn any action, the court may in its discretion direct the attorneys for the parties to appear before it for a conference to consider: (1) [t]he simplification of the issues . . . and (8) [s]uch other matters as may aid in the disposition of the action.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
