G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13B.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The convictions were based on evidence that the child, induced by the defendant, touched the defendant\u2019s penis with her hand and rubbed it with her nose. We conclude that a finding that such actions occurred establishes offenses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>under the statute. Accordingly, we affirm the defendant\u2019s convictions of two counts of indecent assault and battery on a child.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">That the touching occurred is not in dispute, and the jury were warranted in finding the following facts. The defendant was the victim\u2019s mother\u2019s boyfriend and lived with the mother and the victim when she was ten years old. On several occasions during that period, when the child was alone with the defendant, they would play hide and seek, the defendant in his underwear and she in her clothes. After the game, when he found her, she \u201chad to touch the thing.\u201d She also rubbed his \u201cprivate\u201d with her nose. It was not her idea and she did not want to do it; she thought it was his idea. These touchings or rubbings took place in the bathroom with the defendant watching the victim while she touched him. She touched him with her hand on three occasions, each lasting about six minutes; the touching with her nose occurred twice, each episode lasting \u201cprobably five minutes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">The defendant told her not to tell anybody. He and the victim\u2019s mother gave her a \u201cpicture of God\u201d which the victim placed above her bottom bunk bed, on the underside of the upper bunk. When she went to bed, she would pray with the defendant. He asked her to \u201c \u2018[rjepeat after me,\u2019 to say I will always not tell anybody what happened.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">1. <em>Commission of the battery. </em>Several times during the trial, the defendant moved for required findings of not guilty,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and he also objected to the judge\u2019s instructions, claiming that the offenses required that the defendant touch the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">It is true that our cases discussing indecent assault and battery often state that the Commonwealth is required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant committed an intentional, unprivileged, and indecent touching of the victim. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mosby, </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. 181, 184 (1991); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vazquez, </em>65 Mass. App. Ct. 305, 306 (2005). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McCan, </em>277 Mass. 199, 203 (1931) (assault and battery is the \u201cintentional and unjustified use of force upon the person of another, however slight\u201d). In those cases, and in most cases involving indecent assault and battery, it is the defendant who directly commits the battery. It was therefore unnecessary in those cases to discuss the more unusual situation, as here, where the battery (that is, the touching), although induced by the defendant, is committed by the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">In those less frequent situations, however, our cases do not require that the defendant himself perform the touching. Thus in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nuby, </em>32 Mass. App. Ct. 360, 362 (1992), we held that a defendant who forced the victims \u201cto fondle their mother\u2019s breasts\u201d was guilty of indecent assault and battery upon two children under the age of fourteen under G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13B. We also held adequate the judge\u2019s instruction that the perpetrator need not himself perform the indecent touching if he directs or commands the victim to touch a third person in a manner that would be offensive. <em>Id. </em>at 363-364.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> 5Clearly, the defendant in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nuby, supra, </em>would have been equally guilty if he had induced the children to fondle him in an indecent manner. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>50 Mass. App. Ct. 901 (2000), takes this position. That case was tried on the theory that \u201ceither the defendant had \u2018made\u2019 the victim touch his penis, or that he touched the victim\u2019s buttocks with his penis.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 902. While there was evidence that the defendant had touched the victim\u2019s buttocks, \u201cthere was <em>no evidence that the defendant had asked the victim to touch his penis or intended that the victim touch his </em>penis\u201d (emphasis supplied).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Ibid. </em>Since it was unknown on which theory the jury had reached their verdict, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>reversed the conviction. <em>Ibid. </em>Contrary to the defendant\u2019s contention, the discussion in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Taylor, supra, </em>is, in our view, an implicit statement that the statute would be violated if a defendant induced a child to touch his penis.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">The defendant would have us limit <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nuby, supra, </em>to cases involving force or threat of force. The explicit foreclosure of the defense of consent in G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13B,* *<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> see note 1, <em>supra, </em>by the legislative establishment of the element of nonconsent, obviates the requirement that the touching was physically harmful or potentially physically harmful to the victim. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burke, </em>390 Mass. 480, 483-485 (1983). Absence of consent establishes the crime where there is an offensive touching. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">The Supreme Judicial Court \u201cheld that in Massachusetts, as under the common law, \u2018the words \u201cagainst [the victim\u2019s] will,\u201d in the standard definitions [of rape], mean exactly the same thing as \u201cwithout the victim\u2019s consent.\u201d \u2019 <em>[Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burke, </em>105 Mass. 376, 377 (1870)].\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Helfant, </em>398 Mass. 214, 220-221 (1986). Also, in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Colon, </em>431 Mass. 188, 191 (2000), the court held that a twelve year old child was incapable of consenting to kidnapping. The taking away of the child from his rightful custodian \u201cis in law deemed to be forcible and against the will of the child.\u201d <em>Ibid., </em>quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nickerson, </em>5 Allen 518, 526 (1863).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">We view similarly the legal effect of the child\u2019s incapacity to consent under G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13B, and consider <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nuby, supra </em>(where the children committed the touching), controlling, even in the absence of force. It is the nonconsensual \u201caffront to the victim\u2019s personal integrity,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burke, </em>390 Mass. at 483, that makes the child\u2019s touching of the defendant\u2019s penis, when induced by the defendant, an offense. \u201c[T]he gravity of the conduct rises to the level which the[] statute[] [was] designed to prohibit.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number><em>Nuby, </em>32 Mass. App. Ct. at 362. \u201cLike other statutes enforcing \u2018community values [that] still strongly condemn the sexual victimization of minors,\u2019 the purpose of G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13B, is to protect minors from sexual exploitation.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Conefrey, </em>37 Mass. App. Ct. 290, 300 (1994), <em>S.C., </em>420 Mass. 508 (1995), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Benoit, </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. 641, 645 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">Our conclusion is also supported by cases which, albeit without discussion, treat actions induced by the defendant, similar to those of the victim in this case, as offenses under G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13B. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, </em>445 Mass. 217, 219, 225-226 (2005), cert. denied, 126 S. Ct. 1433 (2006) (defendant asked child to scratch his penis because it was \u201citchy\u201d). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fuller, </em>399 Mass. 678, 681, 685-686 (1987) (child put her mouth on or around defendant\u2019s penis).</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">2. <em>Judge\u2019s instructions. </em>The defendant also faults certain of the judge\u2019s instructions, set forth in the margin,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> because the jury were allowed \u201cto convict [him] of assault and battery on proof that he intentionally permitted [the victim] to touch him.\u201d For the reasons discussed in part 1 of this opinion, the judge did not err in giving the objected-to instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">3. <em>Other matters. </em>The defendant\u2019s claim that the prosecutor misstated the evidence is refuted by the child\u2019s direct testimony, noted earlier, that she \u201chad to touch the thing.\u201d The defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>additional claim that the unobjected-to fresh complaint evidence created a substantial miscarriage of justice is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b100-15\">In relevant part, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13B, as amended through St. 1986, c. 187, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-16\">\u201cWhoever commits an indecent assault and battery on a child under the age of fourteen shall be punished ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-17\">\u00cd4</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>\u201cIn a prosecution under this section, a child under the age of fourteen years shall be deemed incapable of consenting to any conduct of the defendant for which said defendant is being prosecuted.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b101-10\">Count 2, based on a touching of the victim by the defendant, was nol pressed by the prosecution because of insufficient evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b101-11\">He filed such motions after the Commonwealth\u2019s opening, after the Commonwealth\u2019s case, and after the defendant\u2019s case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b102-6\">Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Guy, </em>24 Mass. App. Ct. 783, 786 (1987), a case in which the victim was forced by the defendant, a pimp, to engage in oral sex with two women. We held that there was no requirement under G. L. c. 165, \u00a7 <em>22(a), </em>that the sexual contact involve penetration of the victim <em>by the perpetrator.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b102-7\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Taylor, supra </em>at 901, the mother testified that the defendant was naked in front of their daughter and that on some occasions the daughter had reached for the defendant\u2019s penis. We pointed out that \u201c[t]he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>mother, however, never testified that the defendant had said or done anything to cause the victim to touch his penis.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b103-10\">This provision was enacted in response to <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burke, </em>390 Mass. 480, 485 (1983), a case holding that nonconsent was an element of the crime and that the Legislature had not established an age of consent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b104-8\">\u201cThe second element the Commonwealth must prove beyond a reasonable doubt is that the Defendant intended to commit the touching, in other words, that the Defendant intended that [the child] touch his penis with her hands with respect to Count 1, and with her face with respect to Count 3. The Commonwealth must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the touching was not accidental or inadvertent. You, the jury, may or may not infer the Defendant\u2019s intent to do the act by considering all of the facts and circumstances as well as the evidence of the Defendant\u2019s conduct offered during the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-9\">\u201cNow, the third element. Third, the Commonwealth must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the Defendant did in fact engage in a touching, however slight. This means in this particular case you must be satisfied that the Commonwealth has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the Defendant intended and permitted [the child] to touch his penis with her hands, that is Count 1, and touch his penis with her face, that is Count 3. The touching can be done with any part of the Defendant\u2019s body.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
