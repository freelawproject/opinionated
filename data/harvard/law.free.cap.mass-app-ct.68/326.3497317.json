The judge\u2019s findings do not reflect whether he gave \u201ccontinued consideration of the quality of Ufe of the custodial parent,\u201d <em>Pizzino </em>v. <em>Miller, 61 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 865, 875 (2006), in deciding as he did. In addition, certain findings appear to rely on statements of the child, then eleven years old, made in an unrecorded, in camera interview with the judge to which the mother objected. We therefore vacate the judgment and remand for further proceedings.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\"><em>Background facts and proceedings. </em>The parties married in 1988 and have two children: a daughter, bom October 31, 1989, and a son, bom October 23, 1993. Following a \u201chotly contested trial,\u201d the parties were divorced in December, 2003. The divorce judgment provides that the parties were to \u201cshare physical custody of their children\u201d in accordance with a court-imposed parenting schedule, pursuant to which the children were to reside primarily with the mother.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The judgment and parenting schedule entered even though the divorce judge (not the same judge who heard the complaint for modification) was aware that at the time of trial the daughter was, in fact, Uving with the father in Newton. As the divorce judge found, this came about because of the father\u2019s anger with the mother, who was having an affair, which \u201ccaused him to seek an ex parte order for custody of [the daughter], removing the child from the marital home and separating her from her brother.\u201d The mother was found to have been \u201cthe primary homemaker and child rearing parent\u201d during the marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">Since the divorce, the son has continued to reside primarily with the mother who, as found by the judge who presided over the modification action, is the son\u2019s \u201cprimary care parent,\u201d whereas the daughter continues to live with the father. The son <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>visits with the father in accordance with the parenting schedule set forth in the divorce judgment. The mother has become engaged to marry James Seder, and as of September, 2004, they have resided together with the son in the former marital home.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The father denied the mother\u2019s request to relocate with the son to Arizona, where her fianc\u00e9 plans to move,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and on August 25, 2004, the mother filed a complaint seeking authority to remove. The father filed a counterclaim for modification seeking physical custody of both children and an award of child support from the mother. After a three-day trial beginning on July 11, 2005, the judge dismissed the mother\u2019s complaint; denied the father\u2019s complaint as to physical custody of the son; amended the divorce judgment by awarding physical custody of the daughter to the father; and reduced the father\u2019s child support obligation from $400 to $200 per week. The trial judge\u2019s findings and conclusions of law supporting denial of the mother\u2019s request are set forth in an amended memorandum of decision<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> dated September 13, 2005.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>Neither party maintains that the facts of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>present case are governed by <em>Mason </em>v. <em>Coleman, </em>447 Mass. 177, 178 (2006), where the parties had \u201cjoint physical and legal custody\u201d* ******<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> of their children. During the marriage in the <em>Mason </em>decision, \u201ceach parent took the part of a \u2018primary caretaker,\u2019 \u201d and the \u201cparents divided physical custody of the children approximately equally\u201d after the divorce judgment entered. <em>Id. </em>at 178-179. The <em>Mason </em>case is relevant to circumstances where \u201cneither parent has been exercising a clear majority of custodial responsibility.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 185, quoting from the American Law Institute\u2019s (ALI) Principles of the Law of Family Dissolution: Analysis and Recommendations \u00a7 2.17(1), (4)(c) (2002) (Principles of the Law of Family Dissolution).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In such a case, \u201cthe \u2018best interest\u2019 calculus pertaining to removal is appreciably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>different,\u201d <em>Mason </em>v. <em>Coleman, supra </em>at 184, from those in which a primary custodial parent seeks removal, as here.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">In cases such as the one before us, the \u201creal advantage\u201d test applies. See <em>Yannas </em>v. <em>Frondistou-Yannas, </em>395 Mass. 704, 705, 706, 711 (1985) (parents had \u201cjoint legal custody,\u201d but mother had \u201cphysical custody\u201d). Cf. Principles of the Law of Family Dissolution, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 2.17(4)(a) (\u201cThe court should allow a parent who has been exercising the clear majority of custodial responsibility to relocate with the child if that parent shows that the relocation is for a valid purpose, in good faith, and to a location that is reasonable in light of the purpose\u201d). Under the real advantage test, \u201c[sjhould it be found that there is a genuine, recognizable advantage to the custodial parent from the move, the inquiry then turns to whether the move is consistent with the children\u2019s best interests. It is important to emphasize that consideration of the advantages to the custodial parent does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>disappear, but instead remains a significant factor in the equation.\u201d <em>Pizzino </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>67 Mass. App. Ct. at 870.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">a. <em>Good, sincere reason to move. </em>\u201c[T]he first consideration [in the process of determining the best interests of a child] is whether there is a good reason for the move, a \u2018real advantage.\u2019 \u201d <em>Yannas </em>v. <em>Frondistou-Yannas, supra </em>at 711. This requires that the custodial parent establish \u201ca good, sincere reason for wanting to remove to another jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The judge must consider both \u201cthe soundness of the reason for moving, and the presence or absence of a motive to deprive the noncustodial parent of reasonable visitation.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>See <em>Rosenthal </em>v. <em>Maney, </em>51 Mass. App. Ct. 257, 267 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">Here, the judge found that \u201cif [the mother] marries Dr. Seder, [she] will have more economic security than she presently has,\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and that \u201cthe [mother] would benefit emotionally and socially if she moved to Arizona because she wishes to reside with her fianc[\u00e9], and it would appear that she is looking for a fresh start away from her extended family.\u201d The judge did not find that the mother had any motive to deprive the father of reasonable visitation; indeed, the parties are in agreement that the father\u2019s time with the son has been consistently maintained in accordance with the court ordered schedule. The findings that the mother would \u201cbenefit emotionally and socially\u201d from the move, as well as financially, establish that the mother had a good, sincere reason to move.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">Despite these findings, the trial judge concluded that the <em>Yannas </em>standard did not focus sufficiently on the child\u2019s best inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>est, which he felt should be \u201cthe sole focus.\u201d This view may have influenced the judge\u2019s ultimate determination that removal would not be in the son\u2019s best interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">b. <em>Collective consideration of remaining factors. </em>\u201cIf the custodial parent establishes a good, sincere reason for wanting to remove to another jurisdiction, none of the relevant factors becomes controlling in deciding the best interests of the child, but rather they must be considered collectively.\u201d <em>Yannas </em>v. <em>Frondistou-Yannas, </em>395 Mass. at 711-712. <em>Rosenthal </em>v. <em>Maney, </em>51 Mass. App. Ct. at 267-268. \u201c[Bjecause the best interests of a child are so interwoven with the well-being of the custodial parent, the determination of the child\u2019s best interest requires that the interests of the custodial parent be taken into account.\u201d <em>Yannas </em>v. <em>Frondistou-Yannas, supra </em>at 710, quoting from <em>Cooper </em>v. <em>Cooper, 99 </em>N.J. 42, 54 (1984). See <em>Hale </em>v. <em>Hale, </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 812, 815 (1981); <em>Rosenthal </em>v. <em>Maney, supra </em>at 266. At this second stage, \u201c[ejvery person, parent and child, has an interest to be considered. The judicial safeguard of those interests lies in careful and clear fact-finding . . . .\u201d <em>Yannas </em>v. <em>Frondistou-Yannas, supra </em>at 712.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">In addition to making findings relative to the initial \u201creal advantage\u201d determination, the judge stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-7\">\u201cThe Court finds that [the son] would not benefit from a move to Arizona as he does not wish to move to Arizona thereby being separated from the [father, his sister], his extended family and Mends. If removal were granted, the Court finds that if [the son] were to visit the [father] and [his sister] on a monthly or bi-monthly basis as opposed to a daily or weekly basis, it would weaken his relationship with them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-8\">\u201cThe Court finds that the educational system of the Newton public schools is superior to the educational system of the Tucson public schools, hence it is beneficial for [the son] to remain in the Newton system. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-9\">\u201cIf removal were granted, the Court finds that reasonable alternative visitation would be problematic in that [the son] would be asked to perform most of the travel because [the daughter] refuses to live with Dr. Seder, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>therefore she would be living in a motel during her visits with the plaintiff. Nevertheless, reasonable alternative visitation could be worked out with [the son] traveling to Newton. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-5\">\u201cThe Court further finds that it would be in the best interest of [the son] to reside with either parent. Presently, [the son] has a shared living arrangement, wherein he spends more time with the [mother]. [The son] has a close relationship with the [father] and his sister. [The son] is a happy, intelligent, well-adjusted child who wishes to continue to reside in the Newton area.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">The judge concluded that \u201cit would be detrimental to the relationship between [the son, his sister,] and the [father] to grant the [mother\u2019s] request to remove [the son] to Arizona. Moving to Arizona would adversely affect the emotional needs of [the son]. Hence, there is no reason to disturb or disrupt [the son\u2019s] life or living arrangement just so the plaintiff may move to Arizona to live with her fianc[\u00e9]. The overriding concern and issue in this case is what is in [the son\u2019s] best interest, and the Court finds it is [the son\u2019s] best interest to deny the [mother\u2019s] request to remove him to Arizona.\u201d These ultimate findings, or conclusions, do not adequately reflect consideration of each of the interests \u2014 those of the mother, as well as the father and the child \u2014 that inform the best interests determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">Apart from the conclusory observation that \u201c[m]oving to Arizona would adversely affect the emotional needs of [the son],\u201d there is no subsidiary finding regarding the potential advantages or disadvantages of the move to him,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> no mention of the mother\u2019s interests and no finding as to her relationship with the son. In contrast, the findings take particular note of the son\u2019s good relationship with his father and sister, and focus on the negative impact on this relationship of a \u201cmonthly or bimonthly\u201d visitation schedule (although the judge also found that \u201creasonable alternative visitation could be worked out with [the son] traveling to Newton\u201d). See <em>Cartledge </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>67 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>Mass. App. Ct. 577, 581 (2006) (disruption in visits with noncustodial parent \u201ccannot be controlling or no removal petition would ever be allowed\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">This is similar to what we found lacking in the findings in <em>Hale </em>v. <em>Hale, </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. at 815 (also involving custodial arrangement in which father had custody of older child and mother had custody of younger children). What we said in the <em>Hale </em>decision applies with equal force here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-6\">\u201cAll of the findings and rulings concerning removal were directed to the husband\u2019s relationship with his children and the relationship between the [siblings]. The judge made no findings as to the relationship of the mother to the child[], nor did he discuss the effect on the child[] of the advantages or disadvantages of the move except as it affected [his] relation to the[] father.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b362-7\"><em>Ibid. </em>See <em>Signorelli </em>v. <em>Albano, </em>21 Mass. App. Ct. 939, 940 (1985) (remand required to consider <em>Yannas </em>factors, where judge gave insufficient \u201cweight to the quality of life of the custodial parent by reason of the separations enforced on her, on her husband, and on her other child\u201d); <em>Rosenthal </em>v. <em>Maney, </em>51 Mass. App. Ct. at 268, quoting from <em>Yannas </em>v. <em>Frondistou-Yannas, </em>395 Mass. at 711 (no findings reflecting consideration of relationship of mother to child or \u201cany improvement flowing from an improvement in the quality of the custodial parent\u2019s life\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">Because the findings focus primarily on the negative effects of the move upon the son\u2019s relationship with his father and sister, and because it is not apparent from the conclusions regarding the son\u2019s best interests that the judge included within the best interests calculation appropriate \u201cconsideration of the quality of life of the custodial parent,\u201d <em>Pizzino </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>67 Mass. App. Ct. at 875, we must vacate the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-9\">c. <em>Other issues. </em>The mother objected at trial to the judge conducting an in camera interview of the children without the guardian ad litem present.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> That interview was not recorded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>and the judge rejected the mother\u2019s request that the court-appointed guardian ad litem be present.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">Rules of the Probate and Family Court permit a judge of that court to \u201chear motions and other interlocutory matters in chambers or in open court.\u201d See Rule 15 of the General Rules of the Probate Court; Rule 101 of the Supplemental Rules of the Probate Court. However, \u201call courtroom proceedings, with certain exceptions for matters of a preliminary or administrative nature, shall be recorded electronically .... Motion hearings, including ex parte matters, and pretrial conferences shall also be recorded.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Rule 201 of the Supplemental Rules of the Probate Court. The only exception to the recording requirement is the \u201c[ujncontested adoption hearing[] held in the lobby.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Nothing in these rules exempts a judge interviewing children in camera from making an electronic record of the proceedings. See also Uniform Marriage and Divorce Act \u00a7 404(a), 9A (Part II) U.L.A. 380 (Master ed. 1998) (requiring \u201ca record of the interview to be made and to be part of the record in the case\u201d); Principles of the Law of Family Dissolution, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 2.14, comment a (\u201cThe practice in most jurisdictions is to require a transcript, videotape, or other reliable means of recording the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>complete interview, which may be reviewed by the parties and becomes part of the record on appeal\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">The requirement that an in camera interview be recorded is consistent with our expressed concern about due process and fundamental fairness when children are interviewed in camera. \u201cAny opportunity to rebut [a witness\u2019s] testimony is lost when the judge allows a witness to testify in a private session, such as occurred here.\u201d <em>White </em>v. <em>White, </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. 132, 142 (1996). Cf. <em>Duro </em>v. <em>Duro, </em>392 Mass. 574, 581 (1984) (judgment awarding custody of two minor children was reversed because judge had received private oral reports from probation officer, and parent had no opportunity to cross-examine probation officer); <em>Adoption of Mary, </em>414 Mass. 705, 710 (1993) (\u201cDue process concerns and fundamental fairness require that a parent have an opportunity effectively to rebut adverse allegations concerning child-rearing capabilities, especially in a proceeding that can terminate all legal parental rights\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">Here, the judge\u2019s finding that the son \u201cwould not benefit from a move to Arizona as he does not wish to move to Arizona thereby being separated from the [father, his sister], his extended family and friends,\u201d appears to have been based largely on the son\u2019s statements made during the unrecorded in camera interview with the judge.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> As such, it figured significantly in the judge\u2019s determination of best interests. In any subsequent proceeding, if the judge conducts an in camera interview of the son, the interview must be electronically recorded and that record made available to the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">We are confident that the trial judge was motivated solely by a desire to obtain as much helpful information as possible in order to decide the difficult issues before him involving the son\u2019s best interests. Indeed, over one and one-half centuries <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>ago, the Supreme Judicial Court determined that in cases involving \u201cthe liberty and welfare of [] children . . . , the judge who hears the case ought to satisfy himself whether the children are improperly restrained, and whether their comfort and education are properly attended to. ... If the children [are] of suitable age, he might to some extent be influenced by their opinions and preferences.\u201d <em>Dumain </em>v. <em>Gwynne, </em>10 Allen 270, 275 (1865).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> It is to this case that we trace subsequent decisions citing the same exception to \u201cthe ordinary modes of trial.\u201d See, e.g., <em>White </em>v. <em>White, </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. at 140-141 (no objection to in camera interview; limited exception not applicable to twenty-two year old child); <em>Ardizoni </em>v. <em>Raymond, </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. 734, 735-736, 741 (1996) (parties consented to in camera interview; case remanded where judge\u2019s \u201carticulated reasoning manifests an excessive reliance upon the preferences of two eleven year old children as to which parent each would like to live with\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">There has been no decision in the last decade discussing in camera interviews of children, nor has any decision of our appellate courts considered current research as to the circumstances which contribute to or detract from the reliability of children\u2019s statements made during in camera interviews conducted by a judge.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">We recognized in the <em>Hale </em>decision that \u201cthe preferences of children of these ages must be treated with caution. . . . It is natural for children of nine and thirteen to prefer not to leave their school and friends.\u201d <em>Hale </em>v. <em>Hale, </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. at 820. In addition to citing numerous cases, we referenced the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>work of Wallerstein &amp; Kelly, Surviving the Breakup 314-315 (1980), in which the \u201cauthors show the defects of relying on the opinions or preferences of children of these ages.\u201d <em>Hale </em>v. <em>Hale, supra. </em>See Principles of the Law of Family Dissolution, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 2.08 comment f (child\u2019s preference can be \u201cunreliable, short-sighted or irrational\u201d). On the other hand, while cautioning against reliance on the stated preferences of young children, the ALI would extend to judges the \u201cdiscretion to interview the child, or direct another person to interview the child, in order to obtain information relevant to the issues of the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 2.14. That section goes on to state: \u201cCounsel for a parent or for a child should be permitted to propose questions to the court that may be asked of the child.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">Some jurisdictions limit or prescribe the circumstances in which in camera interviews by judges may be conducted.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Although we have set forth in the margin articles and decisions discussing these issues, we do not suggest that this reflects exhaustive research of the subject or that any of the approaches proposed in these materials should be adopted in this Commonwealth. We think the issues worthy of attention, but they have not been sufficiently raised and argued in this appeal to enable us, at this time, to determine whether to impose new <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>rules governing the conduct of an in camera interview of minor children in custody proceedings or whether in some circumstances such interviews ought not to be conducted.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">The mother also challenges the judge\u2019s focus on the son\u2019s relationship with his sister, as failing to provide a proper basis to deny removal. There is nothing in the findings to suggest that the son\u2019s relationship with his sister or other members of this extended family \u201care so important to [his] emotional well-being that they deserve primacy over his relationship with his mother.\u201d <em>Rosenthal </em>v. <em>Maney, </em>51 Mass. App. Ct. at 270. On the other hand, consideration of a sibling relationship may be one of the many factors to be considered when deciding what is in a child\u2019s best interests, so long as the judge makes \u201cspecific or detailed findings based on evidence within the record, apart from the children\u2019s own statements of preference.\u201d <em>Ardizoni </em>v. <em>Raymond, </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. at 741.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\"><em>Conclusion. </em>The report is discharged. We vacate the judgment and remand this matter for further hearing so that findings may be made, consistent with this opinion, as to all of the relevant interests. It is within the judge\u2019s discretion to consider evidence regarding the current circumstances of the parties and the son.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b355-6\">The trial judge having retired, the matter must be reassigned to a new judge for further hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b355-7\">In general, the children were to stay overnight with the father on Tuesdays, returning to school the next day, and alternating weekends from Friday until the next school day.

These functions include physical supervision, feeding, grooming, discipline, transportation, direction of the child\u2019s intellectual and emotional development, and arrangement of the child\u2019s peer activities, medical care, and education. . . . Because caretaking functions involve tasks relating directly to a child\u2019s care and upbringing, it is assumed that they are likely to have a special bearing on the strength and quality of the adult\u2019s relationship with the child. For this reason, the Chapter [setting forth principles governing allocation of custodial and decision-making responsibility for minor] makes each parent\u2019s share of past caretaking fiinctions central to the allocation of custodial responsibility at divorce.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b359-8\">The judge also found that, \u201cif she does not marry Dr. Seder, she will have less financial security than she presently has, because she would be giving up her employment here where she earns $810 per week without securing employment in the Tucson area.\u201d There is nothing in the record to suggest that the mother will not be working in Tucson and earning at least the amount she presently earns, or that Seder and the mother will not then be married (when considerations of multiple house moves are no longer an impediment, see note 4, <em>supra).</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b359-9\">Despite the findings clearly supporting the determination that the mother has established a real advantage to the move, the modification judgment, dated August 4, 2005 (which predated the findings by one month), concluded that the mother \u201chas failed to sustain her burden that there is a \u2018real advantage\u2019 in removing\u201d the son to Arizona.

See <em>Dickenson </em>v. <em>Cogswell, </em>66 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>Mass. App. Ct. 442, 449 (2006); <em>Pizzino </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>67 Mass.

App. Ct. at 872.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">I need not recite the legal standard that must be satisfied before we can conclude that a judge has abused his discretion. Suffice it to say that in this case, it is my belief that such a conclusion is not warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">In a nutshell, the judge found that the son:</p>\n<p id=\"b368-8\">a. expressed a desire to stay in Massachusetts and not move to Arizona<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>;</p>\n<p id=\"b368-9\">b. was well-adjusted in his current setting;</p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>c. had a close relationship with his sister (who is remaining in the Commonwealth* ****<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>), which would be weakened if he were removed;</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">d. had a close relationship with his father, which also would be weakened if he were removed;</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">e. had an extensive social circle of friends and family in Newton;</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">f. had a strong relationship with his local extended family, including his uncles, cousins and grandparents, who played an important supportive and developmental role; and</p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">g. was attending a superior school system.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b369-9\">The mother had no family in Arizona,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> although her retired fianc\u00e9, James Seder (who testified that he would move to Arizona even if the mother\u2019s request for removal were denied),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> had family that had recently relocated there. While the mother, who had not obtained work in Arizona, asserted that she would have greater employment opportunities in Arizona as a compounding pharmacist (whereas she had only obtained work in Massachusetts as a part-time \u201cordinary\u201d pharmacist), and that she would have opportunities to create a nutriceuticals business in Arizona (having failed in such an attempt in Massachusetts), the judge found that the market for compounding pharmacists in the Tucson, Arizona, area was substantially the same as in the Newton area, and that there was no reason to speculate that the mother would be any more successful in run<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>ning a nutriceuticals business in Arizona than she had been in Massachusetts. Finally, while the son had a good relationship with Seder, his sister, who apparently blamed Seder for breaking up her parents\u2019 marriage, plainly did not, refusing to stay in the couple\u2019s newly purchased home in Arizona.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">The father currently lives within one and one-half miles of his son, allowing him to participate in his son\u2019s life on a regular basis through sports, school events, and other traditional modes of parental involvement. The boy\u2019s sister, with whom the boy has, as noted, a \u201ctight\u201d relationship, resides with the father, and her inability to accept her mother\u2019s new fianc\u00e9 would prevent easy visitation between the siblings.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> A cross-country visitation program would impose significant stress on the son,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> exceeding the speculative benefit of the stress relief cited by the mother as an impetus for her relocation.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">The situation here is markedly similar to <em>Dickenson </em>v. <em>Cogswell, </em>66 Mass. App. Ct. at 444-446. The mother in <em>Dickenson </em>sought to move to California with her new husband. In affirming the denial of her request for removal, this court expressed concerns with cross-country visitation, removal of a child from his network of extended family, termination of the father\u2019s common interactions with his son through sports and school-related activities, and the strength of the father-son bond \u2014 the very concerns raised here.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">Here, as in <em>Dickenson, </em>the mother\u2019s proffered reasons for removal, balanced against the relevant factors weighing against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>relocation, simply do not provide for the best interests of her two children.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">On the merits, given the judge\u2019s findings, this does not appear to me to be a particularly close case. Indeed, most of the mother\u2019s arguments address weight, typically a losing proposition. This appears to be a straightforward instance where the advantage of relocation to the mother is outweighed \u2014 clearly, I would assert \u2014 by doing what is best for her children. The interests of all of the parties were appropriately addressed and a decision rendered thereupon, which reached a correct conclusion: that it is in the best interests of both children that the son not be removed. I would, thus, affirm the decision of the trial judge.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b367-10\">The trial judge was fully aware of the pertinent statute and case law, incorporating them by name and principle in his decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b368-10\">Both the <em>Dickenson </em>and <em>Pizzino </em>cases involved the mother of children seeking to relocate to be with her new husband. Whether a different analysis should be applied where the mother seeks to move to join her fianc\u00e9, as here, is best left for another day.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b368-11\">The court indicates that neither party maintains that <em>Mason </em>v. <em>Coleman, </em>447 Mass. 177 (2006), controls, each relying instead upon <em>Yannas </em>v. <em>Frondistou-Yannas, </em>395 Mass. 704 (1985). In <em>Yannas, </em>\u201cwe addressed removal where one parent had <em>sole </em>physical custody of the children. Today we consider the appropriate standard where parents have joint physical and legal custody\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Mason </em>v. <em>Coleman, supra </em>at 178. It would appear, thus, that the case at bar is more analogous to <em>Mason </em>than <em>Yannas.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b368-12\">In every case, some findings are more significant than others, upon which the judge is permitted to rely heavily. Here, the siblings enjoyed a close relationship, upon which removal would have a negative effect. The judge was permitted to give more weight to that determination than others. This, of course, does not mean that he was free to ignore other factors that should be considered.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b368-13\">The majority downplays the son\u2019s preference to remain with his father and sister in the Commonwealth where he has lived his life to date. The majority indicates that the son\u2019s preference came from an interview with the judge. While that meeting may have been a source of the information, it was not the only source; the guardian ad litem (GAL) testified as to the son\u2019s preference. As we give children who have reached the age of twelve in termination cases the ultimate determination as to whether to approve adoption, see G. L. c. 210, \u00a7 2; <em>Adoption of Ramona, </em>61 Mass. App. Ct. 260, 266 n.13 (2004), a judge is free to place whatever weight, including significant weight, on the wishes of the child, especially an older one. I recognize that the son was born on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>October 23, 1993, and the judge\u2019s amended memorandum of decision was issued September 13, 2005.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b369-12\">The daughter lives with her father, notwithstanding the divorce judgment order indicating that she was to live primarily with her mother.

Countering this was the report of the family service clinic which indicated \u201cthat if [the son] was removed to Arizona, it would result in undue stress for both children.\u201d The GAL and the family service clinic had many differing conclusions.
