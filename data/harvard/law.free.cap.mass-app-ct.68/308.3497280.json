Background.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The parties are an unusually mobile, financially successful couple with ties to both the United States and China. They were bom in China and married there in 1984. In the mid-1990\u2019s, they immigrated to the United States and settled in Westborough. They have two children, an older daughter, bom in China, who has reached her majority, and the subject child, who was bom in the United States on January 28, 1997, and is a United States citizen. Both parents are \u201cpermanent residents\u201d of the United States \u2014 that is, they hold \u201cgreen cards.\u201d They are highly educated* <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> international entrepreneurs, whose businesses and property are located in both the United States and China. Insofar as living arrangements are concerned, they jointly own a home in Westborough, and they each maintain an apartment in Beijing. They have registered motor vehicles in both Massachusetts and Beijing. The parties\u2019 older daughter received most of her schooling in the United States and now attends college here. Before difficulties arose between them, the parties apparently agreed that the younger child, Mona, would receive her elementary school education in China and thereafter be educated in the United States. In China, Mona attends a school where she boards four days per week. She spends the balance of the week with her father.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> She returns to the United States during school vacations.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">2. <em>The legal proceedings. </em>On June 10, 2005, the wife filed a complaint for divorce against her husband in the probate court. She also requested custody of their nine and one-half year old daughter Mona and a division of marital assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">On July 29, 2005, the husband was served, in hand, with the complaint and the wife\u2019s motion for temporary orders. He and Mona then left for Beijing, where the child was enrolled in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>school according to the parties\u2019 agreement. The husband was not present at the hearing on the wife\u2019s motion for temporary orders, held on August 22, 2005. By order of that date, the probate judge awarded temporary legal and physical custody of the child to the wife, but did not order the husband to return the child to Massachusetts.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">About the same time, through local counsel in Beijing, the wife filed a divorce complaint with the Intermediate People\u2019s Court of Beijing (Beijing court), together with a copy of the probate court\u2019s temporary order. That complaint also sought a division of marital assets and custody of Mona, who, as previously noted, was then in Beijing for the school term.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">On March 9, 2006, the husband moved in the probate court to vacate or modify that court\u2019s temporary order. A judge other than the judge who granted the temporary custody order issued a sua sponte order requiring the parties to attend a status conference on July 19, 2006, where the issue of jurisdiction was to be addressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">On July 4, 2006, prior to the status conference in the Massachusetts action, the Beijing court granted the parties a divorce, divided their property in China (but not elsewhere), and granted the husband custody of Mona. The Beijing court stated that the child, although bom in the United States, is and has been living in China since 2002, and that it is to the \u201cbenefit of the child\u2019s life and growth\u201d that the father have custody. The available translation of that decision does not explain the rationale by which the benefit to the child was determined, nor does it contain any provision for visitation by the wife.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">By the time of the probate court status conference on July 19, 2006, the child had returned to the United States following completion of her school term in Beijing, and was in the care of the wife in Westborough. Both the wife and the husband appeared and were represented by counsel.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> 6The judge inquired of counsel and the parties, who were sworn. The parties and counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>made representations to the court, but no formal evidentiary hearing was held, nor was cross-examination afforded.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\">On August 6, 2006, the probate judge, relying on G. L. c. 209B, dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction. She concluded that the probate court did not have jurisdiction to enter the temporary order (which she vacated) because the child \u201chad not been domiciled in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts for six months proceeding the filing.\u201d She concluded further that dismissal was warranted because the wife had submitted herself to the jurisdiction of the Beijing court where the matters at issue had been adjudicated and a judgment entered. The judge ordered the wife to \u201cimmediately return the child\u2019s passport documents and/or cooperate with obtaining a duplicate passport such that the child is returned to the father forthwith.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">Thereafter, the judge denied the wife\u2019s various motions to vacate and for reconsideration, to enter a stay, and to appoint a guardian ad litem and an attorney for the child. The wife then filed a request for a stay with a single justice of the Appeals Court. In granting a stay of the judgment, the single justice reasoned that potentially significant facts may not have been fully developed or given adequate consideration in the probate court. We agree substantially with that assessment. We conclude that the judge misunderstood and misapplied relevant legal principles and failed to make the careful factual findings necessary for determining (1) whether the probate court had the authority to exercise jurisdiction to decide the custody of the child; and (2) if such authority existed, whether it should be exercised. See <em>Khan </em>v. <em>Saminni, </em>446 Mass. 88, 91, 96 (2006). The judge also erred in dismissing the wife\u2019s divorce complaint insofar as it sought division of certain marital property.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">Accordingly, we reverse and remand to the probate court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. The judge shall receive additional evidence as may be necessary to make the requisite factual findings. See <em>Tazziz </em>v. <em>Tazziz, </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. 809, 813-814 (1988) (when judge failed to recognize discretion to hear custody dispute, case remanded for evidentiary hearing to insure adequate basis for determination of jurisdictional issues).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>3. <em>The custody determination. </em>The probate court unquestionably has personal jurisdiction over the husband and subject matter jurisdiction over the wife\u2019s complaint. The husband was served in hand, and the parties lived together as husband and wife in the Commonwealth for the requisite period. See G. L. c. 215, \u00a7 3; G. L. c. 208, \u00a7\u00a7 4, 5. That jurisdiction is not extinguished by a subsequent proceeding in China.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">With regard to a custody and visitation determination, the issue is not whether the probate court had jurisdiction, but whether the judge had authority to exercise that jurisdiction. See <em>Khan </em>v. <em>Saminni, </em>446 Mass. at 91; <em>E.N. </em>v. <em>E.S., </em>67 Mass. App. Ct. 182, 191-192 &amp; n.20 (2006). To make this determination, the judge was required to apply G. L. c. 209B, the Massachusetts Child Custody Jurisdiction Act (MCCJA),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and determine, in the first instance, whether Massachusetts had \u201chome state\u201d jurisdiction, pursuant to G. L. c. 209B, \u00a7 2(a)(1), at the time that the wife filed the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">General Laws c. 209B, \u00a7 1, as inserted by St. 1983, c. 680, \u00a7 1, defines \u201chome state\u201d as \u201cthe state in which the child immediately preceding the date of commencement of the custody proceeding resided with his parents, a parent, or a person acting as parent, for at least 6 consecutive months .... Periods of temporary absence of any of the named persons are counted as part of the 6-month . . . period.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">As an initial matter, the probate judge did not decide the child\u2019s home State by reference to where the child \u201cresided\u201d as required by the statute. Rather, the judge found that \u201cat the time of the filing of the divorce the minor child . . . had not been <em>domiciled </em>in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts for six months proceeding the filing\u201d (emphasis added). On that basis, the judge determined that the previous order granting the wife temporary custody of the child had to be vacated because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>court did not have jurisdiction. Because the judge did not address the issue framed by the statute, it is open to question whether she evaluated the determinative issue properly. See <em>Pizzino </em>v. <em>Miller, 61 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 865, 872-873 (2006) (court questioned whether \u201cfact finding ha[d] taken place in the light of properly applied legal principles\u201d). Accepting, as we must, that G. L. c. 209B applies in circumstances where the custody dispute is between a \u201cState\u201d (as therein defined) and another nation (as to which the statute is silent), the judge\u2019s decision may not stand. See <em>Khan </em>v. <em>Saminni, </em>446 Mass. at 91, 96. Compare S.W. v. <em>D.P., post </em>901, 903 (2007) (declining to address applicability of G. L. c. 209B to custody dispute involving \u201cState\u201d and foreign nation).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">Also absent from the judge\u2019s determination are the requisite factual findings and analysis whether the child\u2019s elementary schooling in Beijing, agreed on by the parents, constituted a \u201ctemporary absence\u201d within the meaning of the statute. The judge did not consider that Massachusetts could remain the child\u2019s home State even though the child was attending school in Beijing. Being sent to another jurisdiction for purposes of attending school has been viewed elsewhere as only a \u201ctemporary absence,\u201d at least under circumstances where it was not intended that the child remain there indefinitely, and where the child returned home during school vacations. See <em>In re Howard, </em>291 Ill. App. 3d 675, 681 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">Careful factual findings and thoughtful analysis of the entire constellation of facts bearing on the issue of the child\u2019s home State, including whether her elementary schooling in China amounted to a \u201ctemporary absence\u201d within the meaning of the statute, must be undertaken. In this regard, the judge should consider, without limitation, the parents\u2019 intentions and understanding regarding the child\u2019s elementary education in Beijing and education in the United States thereafter, her return to Massachusetts when school was not in session, the parties\u2019 living arrangement before and after their separation (including their commitment to maintaining residency in the United States <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>for naturalization purposes and their residence in the Westborough home), the wife\u2019s (as well as the husband\u2019s) visitation and contact with the child during the school year in China, the child\u2019s relationship with her sibling, and her United States citizenship.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">Having concluded without adequate factual basis that Massachusetts was not the home State for G. L. c. 209B, \u00a7 2, purposes, the judge did not then undertake the necessary factual analysis to decide, pursuant to G. L. c. 209B, \u00a7\u00a7 7 and 14, whether Massachusetts should exercise such jurisdiction as it had or defer to the Beijing court\u2019s subsequent judgment. Under G. L. c. 209B, \u00a7 14, even if Massachusetts has home State jurisdiction to address a custody dispute, it may, for reason of comity, lack authority to exercise such jurisdiction in the face of a judgment rendered by a foreign country. \u201c[Section] 14 compels a judge to \u2018grant due recognition\u2019 to custody determinations rendered by a court of a foreign country \u2018if those determinations have been rendered in substantial conformity with G. L. c. 209B.\u2019 \u201d <em>Khan </em>v. <em>Saminni, </em>446 Mass. at 95, quoting from <em>Custody of a Minor (No. 3), </em>392 Mass. 728, 735 (1984).* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The \u201csubstantial conformity\u201d test requires the satisfaction of three procedural components: whether the foreign court (1) had jurisdiction over the parties and the subject matter; (2) applied procedural and substantive law reasonably comparable to ours; and (3) based its order on the \u201cbest interests of the child.\u201d See <em>Khan </em>v. <em>Saminni, supra </em>at 95, citing <em>Schiereck </em>v. <em>Schiereck, </em>14 Mass. App. Ct. 378, 380 (1982). While the parties do not dispute that the Beijing court had jurisdiction, whether the procedural and substantive law of China is \u201creasonably comparable\u201d to our laws is far from certain on this limited record.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Nor is it apparent that the Chinese judgment, a translation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>of which we have examined, reflects the \u201cbest interests of the child,\u201d who is an American, but not a Chinese citizen.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Beyond a cursory look at the conclusions set forth in the Beijing court judgment, the judge engaged in no consideration of the procedural and substantive comparability of Chinese law to our own, or of China\u2019s willingness to accord due recognition to a custody determination of our courts.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">Similarly, the judge did not consider whether exercising jurisdiction would violate the purposes of G. L. c. 209B or constitute an inconvenient forum. See G. L. c. 209B, \u00a7 7(o)(i), (iii). Nor did the judge address any of the factors set forth in G. L. c. 209B, \u00a7 <em>1(d), </em>for arriving at her determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">We also find unpersuasive the other ground for the judge\u2019s decision to dismiss the case \u2014 that the wife \u201csubmitted to\u201d the jurisdiction of the Beijing court, which then entered a judgment adjudicating custody as well as dividing property held in China. The premise of the judge\u2019s conclusion that the wife voluntarily invoked the jurisdiction of the Beijing court to decide custody anew is open to question. While the wife submitted herself to the personal jurisdiction of the Beijing court, it is far from clear that her resort to that forum on the issue of custody was anything more than an effort to retrieve the child, based upon the temporary order that she had just obtained from the probate court, and to protect assets in China that might not otherwise be protected by a probate court order. See note 14, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\"><em>4. Division of marital assets. </em>Both parties concede that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>probate court has jurisdiction to assign their property interests.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> See G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 34. Having personal jurisdiction over the husband, the probate court may consider property both in and out of the Commonwealth. See <em>Rice </em>v. <em>Rice, </em>372 Mass. 398, 399-400 (1977).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> For this reason, if no other, dismissal of the wife\u2019s complaint for division of marital property was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">5. <em>Conclusion. </em>The judgment of dismissal is vacated, and the case is remanded to the Probate and Family Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b337-7\">The undisputed background facts are set forth in the limited findings of the probate judge as developed further in the memorandum of decision and order of the single justice staying the judgment and order of the probate court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b337-8\">Both parents have postgraduate educations.
