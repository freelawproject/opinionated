Zanini, </em>Assistant District Attorney, for the Commonwealth.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b285-20\"><em>Stuart Alford </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"Am9\">Meade, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AqRL\">Eighteen years after admitting to sufficient facts to warrant his conviction of possession of cocaine,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the defendant moved to vacate his plea based on his claim that he did not receive the \u201cimmigration warning\u201d required by G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 29D. On April 22, 2004, a District Court judge allowed the motion and ordered a new trial. The Commonwealth appeals. Determining that the defendant\u2019s circumstances do not qualify him for a remedy under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 29D, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>On December 20, 1985, the defendant was charged by complaint with possession of a class B controlled substance with the intent to distribute. On January 23, 1986, he admitted to sufficient facts on the reduced charge of possession of a class B controlled substance, and he was sentenced to serve a six-month sentence in the house of correction, suspended for one year. On March 18, 2004, the defendant moved to vacate his plea and requested a new trial. The defendant, a native of Haiti, is married to a United States citizen. Motivated by his desire to become a United States'citizen himself, he needed to wipe clean his criminal slate.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>In </em>his affidavit in support of his motion, he alleged that he did \u201cnot recall being given any notice or warnings with regard to the immigration consequences\u201d of his plea. He claimed that if he had been so advised, he would not have admitted to sufficient facts. After a hearing, but without findings, a District Court judge allowed the motion, and the Commonwealth\u2019s appeal followed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b286-20\">No record of the defendant\u2019s 1986 plea colloquy exists, and the parties have made no effort to reconstruct it. Because the Commonwealth makes no argument that the presumption contained in G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 29D, does not apply,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> we shall assume, without deciding, that this defendant was not provided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>the immigration warning. However, this alone does not provide the defendant with a basis for relief. \u201cThe remedy clause of G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 29D, is triggered only when a defendant can ... demonstrate that he \u2018may\u2019 become subject to one of the immigration consequences enumerated in the statute. We construe this requirement to mean that a defendant must demonstrate more than a hypothetical risk of such a consequence, but that he actually faces the prospect of its occurring.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Berthold, </em>441 Mass. 183, 185 (2004). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barreiro, 67 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 25, 26 (2006). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Agbogun, </em>58 Mass. App. Ct. 206, 208 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"AMI\">In his motion to vacate his plea, the defendant claimed that as a consequence of his plea, he is prevented from becoming a lawful permanent resident and he is subject to removal from the United States. However, he offered no evidence to the motion judge that removal proceedings have been initiated against him or that he has been denied naturalization because of his narcotics conviction. Merely being \u201csubject\u201d to removal or that he \u201cmay\u201d be denied citizenship is insufficient. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rzepphiewski, </em>431 Mass. 48, 50 n.6 (2000) (insufficient basis to vacate plea where there was \u201cno evidence in the record to suggest that this defendant has been taken into custody by the Federal Immigration and Naturalization Service [INS], is currently in deportation proceedings before the INS, or has even been notified by the INS that he is now subject to deportation\u201d). As stated, the defendant posits a hypothetical or, at best, an eventuality, but not a circumstance that he actually, and currently, faces. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barreiro, supra </em>at 26.</p>\n<p id=\"AXW\">Because there has been no showing that the defendant is actually facing any of the enumerated consequences that trigger the allowance of a motion to withdraw a guilty plea pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 29D, i.e., deportation, exclusion from the United States, or the denial of naturalization, his claim is not ripe. Thus, it was error for the District Court judge to have allowed his motion. Finally, because it is possible that the defendant may, in the future, actually face one of the enumerated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>consequences, we leave open the possibility for a court, on an appropriate motion and record, to fashion a remedy at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">The order allowing the defendant\u2019s motion to vacate his guilty plea is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b285-26\">The defendant admitted to sufficient facts and was found guilty in the bench session under the trial de nova system in effect at the time and did not appeal to the jury session. An admission to sufficient facts in such circumstances is the functional equivalent of a guilty plea. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mahadeo, </em>397 Mass. 314, 316-317 (1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b286-25\">An alien who has been convicted of a controlled substance offense is \u201cinadmissible\u201d to the United States, see 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(B)(i)(2000), which in turn makes the alien ineligible for permanent resident status, see U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(a) (2000), and ultimately disqualified from becoming a naturalized citizen. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1427(a)(2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b286-30\">Preceding the instant appeal, the Commonwealth sought relief from the allowed motion to vacate the plea from a single justice of the Supreme Judicial Court pursuant to G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3. Because a motion to vacate or withdraw a guilty plea is properly treated as a motion for a new trial from which an appeal may be taken, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DeMarco, </em>387 Mass. 481, 482 (1982); Smith, Criminal Practice and Procedure \u00a7\u00a7 1250-1251 (2d ed. 1983 &amp; Supp. 2006), the single justice denied the petition; that denial was affirmed on appeal to the full court. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Casimir, </em>442 Mass. 1031 (2004). Less than a year following the allowance of the motion, a single justice of this court permitted the Commonwealth to notice a late appeal. See Mass.R.A.P. 14(b), as amended, 378 Mass. 939 (1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b286-35\">Section 29D provides that in the absence of the official record of the plea, \u201cthe defendant shall be presumed not to have received [the] advisement.\u201d G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 29D. The Commonwealth makes no claim that the presumptian of regularity, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>426 Mass. 657, 664-665 (1998), affects either the presumption contained in G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 29D, or the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>resolution of this case. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pryce, </em>429 Mass. 556, 559 (1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
