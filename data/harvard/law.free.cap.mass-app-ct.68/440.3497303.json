Raedy, was convicted of one charge of assault by means of a dangerous weapon (in violation of G. L. c. 265, 15A), arising out of an incident at the home of Barbara <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>Barry early in the morning of April 24, 2005.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Raedy was sentenced to two and one-half years in the house of correction, with six months suspended pending completion of four years\u2019 probation, drug counselling, and batterer\u2019s counselling. Raedy argues on appeal that the trial judge erred in denying his motion for a required finding of not guilty because the evidence was insufficient to establish that he was the perpetrator of the assault, and that the conviction should be overturned because it was obtained through the Commonwealth\u2019s use of (unobjected-to) hearsay identification testimony, resulting in a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\"><em>Background. </em>We summarize the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O\u2019Laughlin, </em>446 Mass. 188, 190 (2006). On the evening of April 23, 2005, between five and ten people gathered at Barry\u2019s Hingham residence to socialize. Around midnight, Barry retired to one of the rear bedrooms of the house with her boyfriend, Matthew Bradbury, and the victim, Michael Griffin. At approximately 1:00 a.m., they heard \u201csome commotion\u201d from the front part of the house. Griffin heard shouting and banging that sounded like someone attempting to enter the residence. Barry testified that she recognized Raedy\u2019s voice yelling, \u201cWho\u2019s the man of the house, who\u2019s the bouncer.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> His voice sounded heated and upset. Barry had known Raedy for about one and one-half years, during part of which time he had been her boyfriend. Raedy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>had not been invited to the gathering and had not been present earlier in the evening.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">Griffin went part way down the hallway to investigate the cause of the commotion, then retreated to the back bedroom and closed the door. The people in the bedroom heard furniture being thrown and the sound of glass breaking in the hallway. Griffin then either opened the door again, or it was pushed open from the outside, and someone in the hallway reached inside the room and smashed a glass liquor bottle over Griffin\u2019s head.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Griffin testified that he could not see who struck him. Barry testified that she saw the assailant\u2019s white forearm wielding the bottle that struck Griffin, but that she could not see the assailant\u2019s face.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">Hingham police Officer Philip Emmott was dispatched to Barry\u2019s house within minutes after the attack. By the time he arrived on the scene, at approximately 1:12 a.m., Raedy and his companion were no longer at the house. Emmott testified that, moments after his arrival, Barry reported to him that Raedy (whom she identified by name) had \u201cbroke[n] a bottle over [Griffin\u2019s] face.\u201d Emmott testified that Barry also told him where Raedy lived, which led to unsuccessful police efforts to locate him at his residence.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\"><em>Discussion. Motion for a required finding of not guilty. </em>Raedy argues that the trial judge erred in denying his motion for a required finding of not guilty on the charge of assault by means of a dangerous weapon. He advances not merely the general claim that there was insufficient evidence identifying him as the assailant, but also the specific contention that there was no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>evidence \u201cthat any person had witnessed the perpetrator commit the assault and battery.\u201d Raedy\u2019s thesis reflects a fundamental misconception of our law, which does not unalterably require percipient eyewitness testimony to the crime charged in order to submit the case to the jury for its verdict. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lao, </em>443 Mass. 770, 779-780 (2005) (\u201c[T]he evidence of a defendant\u2019s guilt may be . . . entirely circumstantial. . . . Any weaknesses in . . . identification [evidence] were for the jury to weigh, and did not constitute grounds for a required finding of not guilty\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">The Commonwealth\u2019s evidence against Raedy warranted such submission here under applicable standards. \u201cIn reviewing the denial of a motion for [a required finding of not guilty], we determine whether the evidence offered by the Commonwealth, together with reasonable inferences therefrom, when viewed in its light most favorable to the Commonwealth, was sufficient to persuade a rational jury beyond a reasonable doubt of the existence of every element of the crime charged.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>378 Mass. 680, 686 (1979), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Doherty </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>502 U.S. 1094 (1992). Although \u201c[t]he question of guilt must not be left to conjecture or surmise,\u201d circumstantial evidence, without the buttress of direct evidence, is, as noted above, \u201ccompetent to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt,\u201d even in cases charging premeditated murder unwitnessed by anyone. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lodge, </em>431 Mass. 461, 465 (2000), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>396 Mass. 306, 312 (1985). Further, inferences \u201cdrawn from circumstantial evidence \u2018need only be reasonable and possible; [they] need not be necessary or inescapable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lodge, </em>431 Mass. at 465, quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bush, </em>427 Mass. 26, 30 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">To prove the crime of assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon under G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 15A(6), the Commonwealth had to establish that (1) the defendant intentionally touched the victim, however slightly; (2) the touching was unjustified; and (3) the touching was done by means of (i.e., with) a dangerous weapon. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Appleby, </em>380 Mass. 296, 306-307 (1980). The only element at issue in this case was, and is, the identity of the offender. As noted earlier, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>Raedy\u2019s central argument \u2014 that the Commonwealth\u2019s case failed because it presented no eyewitness who testified that he (or she) saw Raedy\u2019s face as he committed the assault \u2014 is meritless, because no such direct, contemporaneous evidence was required. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>436 Mass. 799, 806-807 (2002) (witness\u2019s telephonic identification to police of former husband\u2019s voice on answering machine threatening her as his next shooting victim admissible); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lao, </em>443 Mass. at 773, 778-779 (identification of defendant waiting away from victim\u2019s apartment building close to time when crime occurred, with door to building left open, allowed inference that defendant had just been in victim\u2019s building); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ferrer, </em>47 Mass. App. Ct. 645, 646-647 (1999) (sufficient evidence although no one actually saw gun in defendant\u2019s hand or flash of gunshot from his immediate vicinity); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Melton, </em>50 Mass. App. Ct. 637, 645-646 (2001), <em>S.C. </em>436 Mass. 291 (2002) (sufficient evidence even though no one directly identified defendant as shooter). \u201cThe identity of a third person always is a matter of inference and opinion .... It presents a judgment [for the jury] which may vary indefinitely in the degree of its certainty . . . .\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cappellano, </em>392 Mass. 676, 679 (1984), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kennedy, </em>170 Mass. 18, 24 (1897) (Holmes, J.).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">The precise question before us \u201cis whether, after viewing the [Commonwealth\u2019s] evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, <em>any </em>rational trier of fact\u201d (emphasis in original) could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that it was Raedy\u2019s arm that swung the injurious bottle. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 677 (1979), <em>S.C. </em>423 Mass. 129 (1996), quoting from <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 318-319 (1979). On the evidence presented by the Commonwealth, supported by reasonable inferences that the jury were entitled to draw, the jury could find beyond a reasonable doubt that Raedy was the perpetrator as charged. In sum, the jury could reasonably have concluded that someone barged into Barry\u2019s home at approximately 1:00 a.m. on April 24, 2005, and that it was that person, rather than any of the people who had been present throughout the evening, who was responsible for the violent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>intrusion into the back bedroom and assault on Griffin. The only people seen in the vicinity of the back bedroom at or near the time of the assault who were not present earlier were Raedy and his friend, Charles, who could not have been the assailant because he was black, while the attacker had a white forearm. From the nature of the heated yelling by the intruder \u2014 recognized as Raedy by Barry \u2014 and Raedy\u2019s past relationship with Barry, the jury could rationally infer that he was motivated by jealousy to attack whichever man he found sequestered with Barry.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\">Raedy\u2019s presence in the immediate area of that crime at or near its commission was a significant additional factor supporting his guilt. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bush, </em>427 Mass. at 30 (defendant\u2019s voice heard from area of murder just before shots fired); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lodge, </em>431 Mass. at 465-466 (defendant admittedly present at time of murder); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Conkey, </em>443 Mass. 60, 72-74 (2004) (evidence established defendant entered victim\u2019s home near time of murder). Also telling were the facts that Raedy had left Barry\u2019s residence by the time police arrived within minutes after the assault and that he could not be found at his own residence \u2014 circumstances that the jury could readily view as flight from the scene revealing his consciousness of guilt. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ferrer, </em>47 Mass. App. Ct. at 647.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">Despite Barry\u2019s ultimate denial of making an identification of the perpetrator to Officer Emmott, a reasonable jury could credit Emmott\u2019s contrary testimony, that Barry did indeed identify Raedy as the assailant at the crime scene, over Barry\u2019s conflicting denial. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clements, </em>436 Mass. 190, 192, 195 (2002) (reliability of extrajudicial identification disavowed in court is question for jury, despite witness\u2019s claims at trial that assailant\u2019s face was obscured, it was too dark to make identification, and he was drunk); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cong Due Le, </em>444 Mass. 431, 439-440 &amp; n.8 (2005) (\u201cwhere the jury are confronted with disputed testimony concerning identification, they can determine whose version to believe \u2014 the wit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>ness who claims not to remember or disavows the prior identification ... or the observer who testifies that the witness made a particular prior identification\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">Thus, not only was there evidence that Raedy had been quickly identified as the assaulter, but the Commonwealth additionally provided the jury with evidence allowing them to conclude that Raedy had motive to commit the crime as well as opportunity and had manifested consciousness of guilt. We consequently affirm the trial judge\u2019s denial of Raedy\u2019s motion for a required finding of not guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\"><em>Hearsay. </em>Raedy argues that he is nonetheless entitled to a reversal because the Commonwealth was erroneously permitted to introduce Officer Emmott\u2019s testimony regarding Barry\u2019s extrajudicial statement that he was the assailant. That, he claims, was inadmissible hearsay and created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">Testimony by a third party, such as a police officer, regarding a witness\u2019s extrajudicial identification is substantively admissible if the identifying witness is unable or unwilling to identify the perpetrator in court and is available for cross-examination. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cappellano, </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 272, 276-277 (1983), <em>S.C., </em>392 Mass. 676 (1984).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cong Due Le, </em>444 Mass. at 441, the Supreme Judicial Court overruled its previous holding in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Daye, </em>393 Mass. 55, 61 (1984),<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> to the extent that it had required an identifying witness to acknowledge having made the extrajudicial identifica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>tian in order for it to be admitted substantively (rather than only for impeachment) at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\">Under <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cong Due Le, 444 </em>Mass. at 440, it is immaterial that the identifying witness disavows having made a prior extrajudicial identification, or even denies having any basis for making an identification. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clements, </em>436 Mass. at 191-195 (court attributed no evidentiary significance to witness\u2019s insistence that he had never known identity of shooter due to intoxication and poor lighting at scene, and had only identified defendant\u2019s photograph based on what he had heard from others and pressure from victim\u2019s family). \u201cIf the jury are convinced that a prior identification was made, their use of that identification should not be artificially limited merely because a witness the jury do not believe has denied making that identification.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cong Due Le, supra </em>at 441.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The \u201cmere fact\u201d that Barry\u2019s testimony conflicted with Officer Emmott\u2019s account of Barry\u2019s express extrajudicial identification of Raedy \u201cdoes not make it unhelpful to the jury in evaluating the over-all evidence as to whether the defendant on trial was the one who committed the charged offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 440. It is up to the jury whose version to believe. <em>Id. </em>at 439-440.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">Raedy contends that Barry\u2019s extrajudicial statement was inadmissible even under <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cong Due Le, supra, </em>because Officer Emmott testified only to having heard Barry name Raedy as the assailant (which Raedy speculates might have been the product of Barry\u2019s \u201csurmise\u201d), rather than hearing Barry state that she had directly observed Raedy commit the assault. The <em>Cong Due Le </em>decision, however, made no such distinction. Rather, it dealt generally with disputes between a declarant who disavows making a prior identification and a witness \u201cwho testifies that the [declarant] made a particular prior identification.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 440. In the circumstances, the judge and the jury could permissibly infer that Barry\u2019s extrajudicial statement (as testified to by Emmott) was based upon her own per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>ception. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Galicia, </em>447 Mass. 737, 748 (2006). Moreover, extrajudicial identifications have been held admissible as probative evidence even when they were made by the declarant in the form of a conclusory statement or accusation. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cappellano, </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. at 275 n.4, 276 (\u201cJimmy Cappellano shot me,\u201d said by victim to police officer, admissible as statement of identification).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">Raedy attempts to distinguish <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cong Due Le, supra, </em>from the present case, asserting that there, a police officer observed the declarant \u201cpick out\u201d the defendant\u2019s photograph from an array that the officer had shown him, whereas here, the officer did not personally observe the act of Barry\u2019s identification as it occurred. This purported distinction arises from the provision in Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(1)(C) and its unofficial State cognate, Proposed Mass.R.Evid. 801(d)(1)(C), that an extrajudicial \u201cstatement\u201d is not hearsay (assuming the declarant is available for cross-examination) if it is \u201cone of identification of a person made after perceiving him\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> \u2014 a provision that (he stresses) was quoted and discussed in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cong Due Le, </em>444 Mass. at 437-439. Raedy argues that such language renders third-party testimony as to an extrajudicial identification by a declarant inadmissible for probative (as opposed to impeachment) purposes unless the third party was a percipient observer of the entire identification process, including observing the declarant in the very act of perceiving and identifying the particular person (or an image of that person). In effect, Raedy\u2019s position is that such testimony is substantively admissible only when the extrajudicial identification was the product of contemporaneously observed photographic array, lineup, or one-on-one showup procedures.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">The court in the <em>Cong Due Le </em>case did not, however, so limit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>its ruling,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> but rather relied on the fundamental premise that \u201c[p]rior identification evidence is of substantive value, even in the absence of any in-court identification, because it has occurred under nonsuggestive circumstances and closer in time to the offense,\u201d when there is less chance that the identification has been influenced by fading memories or any sort of outside pressure on the witness. <em>Id. </em>at 441. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Weichell, </em>390 Mass. 62, 71 (1983), cert. denied, 465 U.S. 1032 (1984); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Warren, </em>403 Mass. 137, 140-141 (1988); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martinez, </em>431 Mass. 168, 176 n.6 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">That rationale \u2014 closer in time equals superior probative worth \u2014 applies at least as much when the identification is contained in an apparently impromptu and unprompted statement to the police moments after the crime, as here, as it does to later identifications made after the police have had time to set up a photographic array or lineup.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Its application is peculiarly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>apposite in the instant situation, where the declarant was very familiar with the defendant because of their past romantic relationship, enhancing the reliability of her identification. Requiring the police to observe such a declarant undertaking an essentially pointless exercise of examining a photographic array<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> to pick out a picture of someone the declarant knows well in order to qualify subsequent police testimony regarding the declarant\u2019s identification \u2014 which the defendant\u2019s argument essentially would mandate \u2014 would add little, if anything, to the reliability of the identification, exalt form over substance, and \u201cconstitute a restraint on the police that neither the Federal nor State Constitution requires.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>447 Mass. 274, 283 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">More to the point, no Massachusetts case has ever held that such a restriction is a precondition to the substantive admission of an extrajudicial identification. To the contrary, such identifications have frequently been admitted substantively when, as here, they were made as a part of a witness\u2019s general statement to the police shortly after the crime. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martinez, </em>431 Mass. at 175; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Greene, </em>9 Mass. App. Ct. 688, 689, 692 (1980); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Maioli, </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. 179, 183-184 (1981); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cappellano, </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. at 275-277; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Peterson, 61 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 49, 53-54 (2006).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\"><em>Conclusion. </em>The Commonwealth\u2019s evidence was sufficient to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>allow the jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was the perpetrator of the crime charged, without requiring jury speculation or conjecture; and Officer Emmott\u2019s testimony as to Barry\u2019s extrajudicial identification of the defendant as the wrongdoer was admissible as substantive evidence and did not create a risk of a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b469-6\">On April 25, 2005, Raedy was charged with (1) entering a dwelling at night with intent to commit a felony, G.

Counts one, five, and six were dismissed before the jury were empanelled. At the conclusion of the trial, the judge directed a verdict of not guilty on the charge of assault. Raedy was also acquitted by the jury on the charge of destruction of property exceeding $250.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b469-7\">On direct examination, Barry denied recognizing the voice that she heard as Raedy\u2019s. On redirect, however, she conceded that she did recognize Raedy as the shouter. The jury, aware that Barry was an unwilling witness whose attendance at the trial had to be compelled, could infer her hostility to the Commonwealth and were free to credit her later testimony.

See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Whelton, </em>428 Mass. 24, 26-27 (1998) (improper admission of victim\u2019s pretrial statement inculpating defendant did not create substantial risk where victim took stand and was subject to cross-examination about statement).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b474-11\">Both the declarant, Barry, and the victim, Griffin, testified at trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b474-12\">Here, as in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Daye, </em>393 Mass. at 57-58, at trial the declarant either could not remember or denied making any prior statements identifying the defendant as the perpetrator. At several points, Barry\u2019s statement of inability to identify the defendant as the bottle wielder \u201cwas as consistent with lack of memory as with lack of perception.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cappellano, </em>392 Mass. at 679.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b475-6\"> As long as Raedy\u2019s confrontation and due process rights were satisfied by Barry taking the stand and being subject to cross-examination, the extrajudicial identification was admissible substantively. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Blaney, </em>387 Mass. 628, 631 (1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b476-6\">Proposed Mass.R.Evid. 801(d)(1)(C) omits the word \u201cmade.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b476-7\">Raedy notes that <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cong Due Le, </em>441 Mass. at 433-435, involved a police officer\u2019s testimony that he had shown the declarant a photographic array containing the defendants\u2019 photographs, and that the declarant had \u201cpicked out\u201d the defendants\u2019 photographs from the array and identified the defendants as the assailants (an identification that the declarant denied at trial).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b477-6\">Even the plain meaning of Proposed Mass.R.Evid. 801(d)(1)(C) relied on by Raedy does not support his reading that the testifying witness has to observe the declarant in the very act of identifying the defendant. The rule\u2019s requirement that, to be nonhearsay, the statement be \u201cone of identification of a person [made] after perceiving him\u201d focuses on the nature of the statement as an act of communication by the declarant to the witness identifying the person after the <em>declarant </em>has perceived that person, not as an act of the declarant perceived by the witness as it occurs. As noted earlier, both the judge and jury here could readily and reasonably infer that Barry\u2019s unequivocal statement to Officer Emmott soon after the crime was committed, identifying Raedy as the bottle assailant, was the product of her own perception. Whether that identification had some other basis beyond Barry\u2019s perception was a matter for the jury to decide. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cong Due Le, </em>444 Mass. at 439-440.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b477-7\">The court in the <em>Cong Due Le </em>case suggests that the former type of extrajudicial identification may be more trustworthy than the latter types, since it \u201c \u2018takes place before the defendant or some other party has had the opportunity, through bribe or threat, to influence the witness to change his mind\u2019 .... [A] witness\u2019s testimony about the identification procedure itself \u2014 what the witness was asked to do, what selection (if any) the witness made, and what the witness said about that selection \u2014 is also susceptible to improper influences.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cong Due Le, </em>444 Mass. at 441 (citation omitted). Such an on-the-scene identification is arguably more reliable than police-observed photographic array, lineup, and showup identifications, all of which raise greater due process concerns, or at least the greater likelihood of due process challenges, on the ground of unnecessarily suggestive police conduct. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Simmonds, </em>386 Mass. 234, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>235-240 (1982) (lineup); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thornley, </em>400 Mass. 355, 362-364 (1987) (photographic array); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>447 Mass. 274, 278-284 (2006) (showup). Indeed, the circumstances of the extrajudicial identification here involved a lesser degree of suggestiveness than that which inheres in any in-court identification. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Napolitano, </em>378 Mass. 599, 604 (1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b478-8\">In this case, a showup or lineup was not feasible because of the defendant\u2019s flight and evasion of the police.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b478-9\">Statements admissible as pretrial identifications extend beyond specific identifications of particular individuals and include descriptions of an unarmed perpetrator\u2019s physical characteristics or clothing. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martinez, </em>431 Mass. at 175; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Weichell, </em>390 Mass. at 72 (physical description and resulting composite drawing); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. 685, 690 (1991) (clothing). Although there are a few decisions from other jurisdictions which appear to support Raedy\u2019s interpretation of rule 801, the Commonwealth has convincingly demonstrated that there are far more substantial and persuasive cases outside our jurisdiction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>for admitting identifications made during police questioning shortly after the crime. See particularly <em>United States </em>v. <em>Owens, </em>484 U.S. 554, 564 (1988) (identifications during interview and then through photographic array both held substantively admissible without distinction); Weinstein\u2019s Evidence Manual \u00a7 15.01[4], at 15-10 (2006) (\u201cRule 801 [d][l][C] applies regardless of when the prior identification was made \u2014 whether at the scene of the crime, at a later chance encounter, or at a police line-up\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
