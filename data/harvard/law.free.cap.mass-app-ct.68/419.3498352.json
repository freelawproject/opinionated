Famum, appeals from an order of the single justice of this court, affirming an award pursuant to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6F, by a Land Court judge of $218,537.29 in attorney\u2019s fees and costs to defendant Mesiti Development (Mesiti) based on a finding in the Land Court that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>Farnum\u2019s claim was wholly insubstantial, frivolous, and not advanced in good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\"><em>Background. </em>Mesiti sought a special permit from the planning board of North Andover (board) to construct ninety-six town houses on a locus across the street from land owned by Famum. Famum, an objecting abutter, claimed as his principal basis for standing that the project\u2019s water drainage system would have a negative effect on his land; he also complained of adverse vehicular traffic consequences. After a hearing, the board granted a special permit to Mesiti.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">In an action brought in the Land Court pursuant to G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 17, Famum sought to overturn the board\u2019s decision. Following a three-day trial, a Land Court judge ruled in a thirteen-page decision that Farnum did not have standing because he was not aggrieved and, therefore, could not assert a claim under G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 17. Famum appealed and this court affirmed the judgment in an unpublished memorandum and decision pursuant to our rule 1:28. <em>Farnum </em>v. <em>Mesiti Dev., </em>64 Mass. App. Ct. 1113 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">On September 22, 2005, almost fifteen months after the Land Court judgment entered, and while the appeal therefrom was pending, defendants Mesiti and the town of North Andover (town) filed motions for attorney\u2019s fees, costs, and expenses under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6F. A hearing was held on the motions on October 18, 2005. On October 26, 2005, the decision on the direct appeal was rendered by this court (with the rescript issuing to the Land Court on November 23, 2005). On November 14, 2005, the trial judge issued her decision on the \u00a7 6F motions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The judge\u2019s order awarded to Mesiti a total of $218,537.29, including $154,558.20 in legal fees and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>$37,753.16 in costs.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The order also awarded $6,886.46 in attorney\u2019s fees and costs to the town. Famum took an appeal from the award to a single justice of this court, who affirmed the order on February 1, 2006. Famum has appealed from the single justice\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">On appeal, Famum primarily argues that (1) Mesiti and the town\u2019s \u00a7 6F motions were not timely filed; and (2) the award to Mesiti of over $200,000 in attorney\u2019s fees and costs is excessive.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">According finality to the findings and decision of the single justice, \u201cwe limit our review of the single justice\u2019s order to any alleged error of law or abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Karellas </em>v. <em>Karellas, </em>61 Mass. App. Ct. 716, 720 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">1. <em>Famum\u2019s claim that the defendants\u2019 motions were untimely. </em>General Laws c. 231, \u00a7 6F, does not specify when a motion for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>attorney\u2019s fees and costs must be filed. Famum claimed in his appeal to the single justice from the order of the Land Court judge that the \u00a7 6F motions for fees and costs were not timely filed because the motions were filed almost fifteen months after the entry of the judgment in the Land Court. The single justice rejected the contention, noting that \u00a7 6F does not specify any time period within which a motion must be filed and that no appellate court has imposed a requirement that the motion be filed within a reasonable time after the entry of a judgment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In the circumstances, we do not reach Famum\u2019s timeliness argument because it was waived through his failure to raise it before the trial judge.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> See <em>Custody of Kali, </em>439 Mass. 834, 839 (2003); <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Hastings &amp; Koch Enterprises, Inc., </em>38 Mass. App. Ct. 271, 281 n.10 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">2. <em>Famum\u2019s claim that Land Court lacked jurisdiction to award attorney\u2019s fees and costs. </em>As a corollary to Famum\u2019s claim that Mesiti and the town\u2019s motions were untimely, he claims that the Land Court was divested of jurisdiction to award attorney\u2019s fees and costs once the appeal from the judgment had been docketed in this court. Because we view this claim as a challenge to the subject matter jurisdiction of the Land Court, and because subject matter jurisdiction can never be waived, it may be raised for the first time on appeal. See <em>Chestnut-Adams </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number><em>Ltd. Partnership </em>v. <em>Bricklayers &amp; Masons Trust Funds of Boston, Mass., </em>415 Mass. 87, 90 (1993), and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">Although Famum correctly claims that the docketing of the appeal divests the Land Court of jurisdiction to act on motions relating to the judgment, this well-recognized procedural rule generally relates only to motions to rehear or vacate the judgment. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cronk, </em>396 Mass. 194, 197 (1985); <em>Springfield Redev. Authy. </em>v. <em>Garcia, </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. 432, 434-435 (1998). A motion under \u00a7 6F is a collateral proceeding, separate from but not entirely divorced from the underlying judgment. See <em>Ben </em>v. <em>Schultz, </em>47 Mass. App. Ct. 808, 814 (1999). See also <em>Budinich </em>v. <em>Becton Dickinson &amp; Co., </em>486 U.S. 196, 200 (1988) (\u201cAs a general matter, at least, we think it indisputable that a claim for attorney\u2019s fees is not part of the merits of the action to which the fees pertain\u201d). As such, it does not affect the underlying judgment, and the docketing of the appeal from that judgment does not divest the lower court of subject matter jurisdiction to entertain a \u00a7 6F motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">3. <em>The reasonableness of the amount of Mesiti\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees and costs. </em>Mesiti\u2019s lead counsel requested an award of $218,537.29 for attorney\u2019s fees and costs: $180,784.13 in attorney\u2019s fees and $37,753.16 in costs. In support of his request, counsel submitted twenty-one invoices from two law firms with whom he was employed during the pendency of the action in the Land Court and the subsequent appeal by Famum to this court.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The invoices set out in considerable detail the amount of time spent by lead counsel and his associates and staff on each task associated with preparation for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">After the nonevidentiary hearing on the \u00a7 6F motions, the judge issued a memorandum of decision, in which she stated her finding that the hourly rates of Mesiti\u2019s lawyers and their legal staff were reasonable. The judge also found that \u201cthe amounts requested by Mesiti are reasonable, given the number of hours required for Mesiti\u2019s lawyer[s] and expert witnesses to prepare properly for an action where Mesiti bore the burden of going forward and persuasion in a de nova trial.\u201d The judge al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>lowed the request and awarded $218,537.29, the amount sought by Mesiti.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">Famum claims that the attorney\u2019s fees and costs awarded to Mesiti were unreasonable as a matter of law.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Famum does not challenge the competence, reputation, and ability of Mesiti\u2019s lawyer and his associates or the hourly rates charged or the result obtained by counsel. Instead, he contends that the number of hours expended in the preparation for the trial, and the trial itself, was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">In a single paragraph in his brief, Farnum argues that the number of hours was excessive because (1) the trial lasted only three days; (2) there were few substantive motions and relatively few depositions; (3) Mesiti\u2019s experts at trial were the same experts it used at the hearing before the board; and (4) Mesiti could have sought the same result by moving for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">We hold that the above \u201creasons\u201d do not rise to the level of acceptable appellate argument within the meaning of Mass. R.A.P. 16(a)(4), as amended, 367 Mass. 921 (1975). See <em>Powers </em>v. <em>H.B. Smith Co., </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. 657, 664-665 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">Farnum had information from the invoices submitted by Mesiti as to the time spent by lead counsel and his associates in preparation for trial. Yet, despite the information, Famum did not cite in his brief to any particular occasion where he claims that the time spent was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-9\">We are not obliged, nor is the single justice obliged, on appeals concerning the award of fees pursuant to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6F, to read through the submitted documents in search of material that may support the arguments in the appellant\u2019s brief. See <em>Cole </em>v. <em>New England Mut. Life Ins. Co., </em>49 Mass. App. Ct. 296, 297 (2000). It is appellate counsel\u2019s duty to refer specifically to those areas where he or she believes that hours that were expended were unreasonable. That was not done here.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-10\"><em>Conclusion. </em>We therefore affirm the order of the single justice, although that order is modified to direct the Land Court to amend its order on the, \u00a7 6F motions by subtracting from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>Mesiti\u2019s award the $26,225.93 in attorney\u2019s fees and costs for work performed on the appeal of the original judgment. See notes 3 and 7, <em>supra.</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b448-8\">The trial judge\u2019s findings on the \u00a7 6F motions included the following with regard to the trial of Famum\u2019s claims of standing: \u201cThis is not a case where this court weighed the testimony of opposing experts and credited one over the other. [Farnum\u2019s] own expert engineer failed to support [Farnum\u2019s] speculative fears regarding drainage. . . . [Farnum] did not present any evidence that contradicted Mesiti\u2019s expert that the Project would have only a negligible effect on traffic generally, and no special effect on [Famum], . . . Even [Famum\u2019s] expert conceded that the relevant traffic intersection likely would function acceptably and below capacity after the Project was built.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b449-8\">The $218,537.29 total included $26,225.93 in legal fees incurred in connection with the direct appeal of the judgment to this court. The judge stated that the latter amount was not recoverable in the Land Court but only by a motion in the Appeals Court. See <em>Yorke Mgmt. </em>v. <em>Castro, </em>406 Mass. 17, 19-20 (1989). By mistake, however, the judge nonetheless included the $26,225.93 in the total award.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b449-9\">Famum also claims on appeal that the record does not support a finding that Famum\u2019s claim was frivolous and not advanced in good faith. On this point, the single justice concluded as follows: \u201cHaving reviewed the fee award on the basis of the subsidiary facts as found by the trial judge ... the single justice concludes that the plaintiff\u2019s claims were wholly insubstantial, frivolous, and not advanced in good faith. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b449-10\">Review by a single justice of an award pursuant to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6F, is \u201cde nova in the sense that the single justice may draw his or her own ultimate conclusions as to the merits of a fee award, [but] that review is based on \u2018the subsidiary facts as found by the trial judge.\u2019 \u201d <em>Danger Records, Inc. </em>v. <em>Berger, </em>444 Mass. 1, 9 (2005), quoting from <em>Miaskiewicz </em>v. <em>LeTourneau, </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 880, 882 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-11\">In a review of a single justice order affirming a trial judge\u2019s award pursuant to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6F, \u201cthe underlying factual findings adopted and accepted by the single justice are to be treated as \u2018final\u2019 and are not themselves subject to further review. Only errors of law committed in connection with an award under \u00a7 6F may be corrected on appeal from the single justice\u2019s decision under [G. L. c. 231,] \u00a7 6G.\u201d <em>Danger Records, Inc. </em>v. <em>Berger, </em>444 Mass. at 12-13.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-12\">Famum\u2019s argument raises a question as to the factual support in the record for the finding that Famum\u2019s claims were wholly insubstantial, frivolous, and not advanced in good faith. Our review of the single justice\u2019s decision on that point is foreclosed by the standards articulated in the <em>Danger Records </em>case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b450-6\">We note, however, that the fact that G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6F, does not specify when a motion for attorney\u2019s fees and costs must be filed may turn out to be a trap for the unwary.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ennis, </em>441 Mass. 718, 719-720 (2004), the court was called upon to decide whether a motion for appellate fees and costs pursuant to Mass.R.Crim.P. 15(d), as appearing in 422 Mass. 1501 (1996), was timely filed. Rule 15(d) also is silent on when a defendant should file a motion for fees and costs. The court held that \u201cit is in the interests of the efficient administration of justice for a defendant to file a request for attorney\u2019s fees within a reasonable time after resolution of the Commonwealth\u2019s interlocutory appeal.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ennis, supra </em>at 720. A rule 15(d) motion is similar to a motion for fees under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6F, in that it is \u201cnot [a motion] to rehear, alter, or amend the court\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ennis, supra. </em>See <em>Ben </em>v. <em>Schultz, </em>47 Mass. App. Ct. 808, 813-814 (1999). Therefore, the Supreme Judicial Court may hold, in the future, that \u00a7 6F motions must be filed within a reasonable time frame.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b450-8\">In fact, Famum argued the opposite to the Land Court judge: that the \u00a7 6F motions were prematurely filed because the direct appeal had not yet been decided.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b451-8\">Nine of the invoices, totaling $26,225.93, were concerned with legal fees incurred by Mesiti\u2019s lawyers in regard to Famum\u2019s appeal of the Land Court judgment in the underlying case to this court. See note 3, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b452-11\">Famum does not make any argument that the amount of legal fees and costs awarded to the town was excessive.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b453-5\">While we essentially affirm the order of the single justice, in view of the issues raised by Famum in regard to whether the \u00a7 6F motion was timely filed, and the jurisdictional question, Famum\u2019s appeal on this matter is not frivolous. Therefore, we deny Mesiti\u2019s request for attorney\u2019s fees and costs associated with this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
