L. c. 269, \u00a7 10(h); and receiving a firearm with knowledge that the identification number had been defaced in violation of G.

We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\"><em>Background. </em>The jury could have found the following facts. At around 7:50 p.m. on February 21, 2002, Boston police officers, who were patrolling in an unmarked vehicle with a State trooper, noticed a group of five men underneath a \u201cNo Trespassing\u201d sign in the parking lot of a closed gasoline station. The police officers drove over to the men, and Officer Thomas Pratt and State Trooper Derek Outerbridge got out of the vehicle. Either before or immediately after the officers left the vehicle and walked toward the men, the men ran off. Four men ran toward Washington Street, while the fifth, later identified as the defendant, fled toward Shawmut Avenue.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">Officer Lawrence Celester, driving a Boston police department transport wagon, responded to the call regarding the foot chase. Exiting his vehicle, Officer Celester noticed the defendant running and told him, \u201cStop, police!\u201d The defendant complied. The officer found no weapons on the defendant\u2019s person, and the defendant was placed under arrest for trespassing. Because he was driving the transport wagon, Officer Celester took the defendant to the station to await booking on the trespassing charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">While Officer Celester was waiting for the arresting officers to book the defendant, the defendant suddenly blurted out, \u201cYour boys are dumb. They could have me for seven or eight years instead of this trespassing bullshit.\u201d Officer Celester responded, \u201cThey are pretty smart and they are good at what they do.\u201d The defendant then said, \u201cThey\u2019ll never find it. You\u2019re just wasting my time. I could be out doing sticks.\u201d At this time, no firearm had been recovered, and the defendant had not yet been given Miranda warnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-8\"><em>Discussion. </em>1. <em>The admission in evidence of the defendant\u2019s incriminating statements. </em>\u201cMiranda warnings are only necessary where one is the subject of \u2018custody and official interrogation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Larkin, </em>429 Mass. 426, 432 (1999), quoting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>from <em>Illinois </em>v. <em>Perkins, </em>496 U.S. 292, 297 (1990). \u201c[T]he Supreme Court of the United States has defined interrogation as \u2018express questioning or its functional equivalent.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 431 n.4, quoting from <em>Rhode Island </em>v. <em>Innis, </em>446 U.S. 291, 300-301 (1980). The \u201cfunctional equivalent\u201d of express questioning includes \u201cany words or actions on the part of the police (other than those normally attendant to arrest and custody) that the police should know are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from the suspect.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Torres, </em>424 Mass. 792, 797 (1997), quoting from <em>Rhode Island </em>v. <em>Innis, supra </em>at 301. The test is \u201cwhether an objective observer would infer that [the police conduct] was designed to elicit an incriminating response.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chadwick, </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. 425, 427 (1996). The functional equivalent of interrogation \u201cdoes not turn on the subjective intent of the particular police officer but on an objective assessment as to whether the police statements and conduct would be perceived as interrogation by a reasonable person in the same circumstances.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Torres, supra </em>at 797, quoting from <em>United States </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>985 F.2d 3, 7 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 508 U.S. 944 (1993). A statement made spontaneously, and not in response to statements that would be perceived as interrogation, is not subject to suppression. \u201cAny statement given freely and voluntarily without any compelling influences is, of course, admissible in evidence.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chipman, </em>418 Mass. 262, 272-273 (1994), quoting from <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 478 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">As an initial matter, we address the standard of review. \u201cThe denial of a motion to suppress evidence on constitutional grounds ... is reviewable without further objection at trial.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Whelton, </em>428 Mass. 24, 25-26 (1998).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We review the denial of the motion to ascertain whether there was error and, if so, whether it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rosario, </em>430 Mass. 505, 511 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">The exchange of remarks between Officer Celester and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>defendant cannot properly be characterized as custodial interrogation. The exchange was initiated by the defendant spontaneously and voluntarily. The officer's reply was responsive purely to the subject raised by the defendant (the abilities and intelligence of the police officers who first approached the group he was with) and was not reasonably likely to elicit the further incriminating remarks that followed. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Torres, supra </em>at 797. We do not view the officer\u2019s statements as ones that could objectively be perceived as an interrogation. <em>Id. </em>at 796-797. The officer\u2019s remark was \u201ca natural reflex invited by the defendant\u2019s comments,\u201d which had impugned the abilities of his fellow officers. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gittens, </em>55 Mass. App. Ct. 148, 150 (2002). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Diaz, </em>422 Mass. 269, 271 (1996). There was no error; the statements were properly admitted by the judge.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">2. <em>The denial of the defendant\u2019s motion for a required finding of not guilty of possession of a firearm with a defaced serial number. </em>The defendant contests the sufficiency of the evidence that he knew about the gun and, in any event, that he knew the serial number had been defaced. We view the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth to determine whether <em>\u201cany </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d (emphasis in original). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 677 (1979), quoting from <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">The Commonwealth presented evidence that the gun was found in some old tires in a comer near the back area of the garage, an area into which the defendant had fled but his companions had not, and that the ground under the gun was wet from a recent rainfall while the gun itself was dry. As noted above, there was evidence (which we have deemed properly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>admitted) that the defendant knew about the gun and intended to use it. Finally, the Commonwealth presented evidence, including the gun itself, that the serial number had been defaced. The evidence taken as a whole was sufficient to support a guilty verdict. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>57 Mass. App. Ct. 334, 341 (2003); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rupp, </em>57 Mass. App. Ct. 377, 385-386 (2003).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b572-15\">Following his convictions the defendant pleaded guilty as an armed career criminal in violation of G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10G.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b573-9\">He also moved orally during trial to exclude the statements as violating his Miranda rights.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b574-7\">Although the defendant captioned his motion as a motion in limine (suggesting an evidentiary objection which does not rise to a constitutional level and therefore would require further objection at trial to qualify as preserved error), we look to substance rather than nomenclature. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>447 Mass. 274, 278-279 (2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b575-7\">There is also no merit to the defendant\u2019s argument that the judge nevertheless erred by admitting the statement that he \u201ccould be doing sticks,\u201d because it was more prejudicial than probative. The judge was well within the exercise of her discretion in admitting a statement that was highly probative of the defendant\u2019s intent and ability to exercise dominion over the gun, was not the subject of a properly preserved objection, and was admitted subject to the exclusion of any evidence explaining the colloquial use of \u201csticks\u201d to mean armed robberies.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b576-6\">The defendant argues that G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 11C, is violative of his Fifth Amendment right not to incriminate himself by creating a rebuttable presumption that \u201cpossession or control of a firearm\u201d with a defaced serial number \u201cshall be prima facie evidence that the person having such possession or control is guilty.\u201d However, the Supreme Judicial Court has concluded that this language creates a permissible inference rather than a mandatory finding and \u201cdoes not involve lowering the Commonwealth\u2019s substantive burden of proof . . . .\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Maloney, </em>447 Mass. 577, 590 (2006). The judge properly instructed the jury that \u201cthe Commonwealth must prove that the defendant had knowledge, that he knew that the serial number or identification number was removed, defaced . . .,\u201d and that \u201cthe Commonwealth must prove beyond a reasonable doubt. . . that the defendant knew that that serial number or identification number was removed, defaced . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
