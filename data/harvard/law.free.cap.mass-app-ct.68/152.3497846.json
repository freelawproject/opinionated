L. c. 90, \u00a7 23. At issue is the legal effect of the issuance to the defendant of a so-called \u201chardship license\u201d on the defendant\u2019s subsequent apprehension behind the wheel outside of the hours of operation permitted by that license. We affirm the trial judge\u2019s dismissal of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-14\"><em>Facts. </em>In November, 1999, the defendant\u2019s driver\u2019s license was suspended for eight years after his conviction of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol. In March, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>2004, the Registry of Motor Vehicles (registry) issued him a hardship license, which restricted the hours during which he was allowed to operate a motor vehicle to between 8 a.m. and 8 P.M.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">On January 14, 2005, at 11:40 p.m., Sergeant Lament of the Natick police department observed the defendant\u2019s vehicle traveling slowly on a public way. The vehicle swerved several times, and its rear tire was flat and badly damaged. Sergeant Lamont called for assistance. Officer Bosselman, also of the Natick police department, responded and stopped the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">When stopped, the defendant had an odor of alcohol on his breath, and held on to the door frame to steady himself as he slowly got out of his vehicle. Officer Bosselman arrested the defendant. On February 15, 2005, a grand jury returned two indictments charging the defendant with a subsequent OUI offense pursuant to G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24(l)(a)(l), and operating his motor vehicle after the suspension of his license for OUI, pursuant to G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 23. The defendant filed a motion to dismiss the latter indictment. That motion was granted for the reasons discussed below, and the Commonwealth appeals from that decision.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b181-8\"><em>Discussion. </em>General Laws c. 90, \u00a7 23, punishes \u201c[a]ny person convicted of operating a motor vehicle after his license to operate has been suspended or revoked\u201d for operating under the influence <em>\u201cand prior to </em>the restoration of such license or right to operate or to <em>the issuance to him of a new license to operate\u201d </em>(emphasis added). The defendant argued, and the trial judge agreed, that he could not be indicted for a violation of \u00a7 23 because the registry had issued him a new license. We concur. Although a \u201cnew license\u201d is not defined in \u00a7 23, the type of license he was granted \u2014 a hardship license \u2014 is described in G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24(l)(c)(3), as \u201ca new license\u201d subject to certain restrictions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>A \u201cstatute is to be interpreted according to the plain and ordinary meaning of its words.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Conaghan, </em>433 Mass. 105, 110 (2000). \u201c[W]here the language of a statute is clear and unambiguous, it is conclusive as to legislative intent.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mandell, </em>61 Mass. App. Ct. 526, 528 (2004), quoting from <em>Pyle </em>v. <em>School Comm. of S. Hadley, </em>423 Mass. 283, 285 (1996). \u201c[Statutory language should be given effect consistent with its plain meaning.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ferreira, </em>67 Mass. App. Ct. 109, 113 (2006), quoting from <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Brookline, </em>435 Mass. 353, 360 (2001). However, when there is ambiguity in a criminal statute, the statute is to be construed in the defendant\u2019s favor. <em>Youngworth </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>436 Mass. 608, 611 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">In this case, the statute is unambiguous. Upon the \u201cthe issuance ... of a new license to operate,\u201d albeit one with restrictions, the Commonwealth could no longer prove the required elements of a conviction under \u00a7 23. The trial judge properly dismissed the indictment against the defendant because the Commonwealth could not have presented sufficient evidence to support the offense charged. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McCarthy, </em>385 Mass. 160, 163-164 (1982); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Quincy Q., </em>434 Mass. 859, 862-863 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-8\">We recognize that the evidentiary standard for the issuance of a grand jury indictment \u2014 probable cause \u2014 is lower than that for submitting a criminal case to the jury. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lent, </em>420 Mass. 764, 765 n.2 (1995). In fact, evidence insufficient to overcome a motion for required finding of not guilty may nonetheless support probable cause for the issuance of an indictment. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O\u2019Dell, </em>392 Mass. 445, 450-451 (1984); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Arias, </em>29 Mass. App. Ct. 613, 616 (1990), <em>S.C., </em>410 Mass. 1005 (1991). However, in a situation such as this, where an undisputed fact (the issuance to the defendant of a new license and right to operate) renders impossible the defendant\u2019s conviction of the offense charged as matter of law, the indictment should be dismissed. As noted by the trial judge, the proper crime with which to charge the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>is a violation of G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 10, the operation of a motor vehicle without a license.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">\n<em>Order dismissing indictment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b181-9\">Proceedings regarding the indictment charging the subsequent OUI offense were stayed pending the disposition of this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b181-10\">Additionally, the registry certified that \u201con 03/08/04 [the defendant\u2019s] license or right to operate was reinstated in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.\u201d While not controlling, this further supports the defendant\u2019s contention that an indictment under \u00a7 23 was improper.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
