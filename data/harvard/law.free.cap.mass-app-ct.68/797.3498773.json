We agree and reverse the order allowing the new trial motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-17\">1. <em>Background. </em>Indicted for aggravated rape and assault with intent to murder, the defendant, Larry H. Sherman, Jr., pleaded guilty in 1993 to the lesser offenses of rape and assault. After <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>colloquy, a judge accepted the jointly recommended disposition and imposed, for the rape, a sentence of six to ten years in prison, with six months to be served and the balance of the sentence suspended for a three-year probationary period.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Credit for time held in confinement awaiting trial resulted in the defendant\u2019s immediate release at the time of the plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">In October, 1999, a second judge found the defendant in violation of his probation, revoked his probation, and ordered the defendant to serve the balance of his suspended sentence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In April, 2003, the defendant moved for a new trial and to withdraw his guilty plea, asserting that his plea was not intelligent and voluntary because (1) \u201cthe record reveals that he never admitted to facts sufficient to establish the elements of the crime of rape\u201d; and (2) \u201cthe judge failed to inquire . . . whether he pied guilty due to duress or coercion.\u201d Accompanying the motion was an affidavit of the defendant that supported the claim of coercion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The defendant alleged that his former attorney never visited him, failed to ask his version of events, and failed to prepare for trial. He also maintained that she \u201ccoerced and pressured [him] into pleading guilty\u201d by claiming that the district attorney threatened to add a charge of kidnapping if he went to trial, by asserting that he would get a life sentence if found guilty, by falsely claiming that his chance of prevailing at trial was poor, and by failing to divulge that the alleged victim was not going to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-6\">In opposition, the Commonwealth obtained an affidavit from the defendant\u2019s trial attorney that directly contradicted the defendant\u2019s claims of unpreparedness and coercion. Her affidavit detailed her efforts on behalf of the defendant. She engaged in a probable cause hearing in District Court; obtained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>a transcription of that proceeding; spoke to witnesses recommended by the defendant; provided the defendant with police reports, investigative reports, and grand jury minutes; and spoke with the defendant at length. Her discussions with the defendant covered relevant particulars, including the victim\u2019s background as a prostitute and drug addict, the victim\u2019s availability for trial and impeachability, the physical and fresh complaint evidence, the Commonwealth\u2019s offer of a split sentence with credit for time served, and the risks and benefits of proceeding to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">Defense counsel\u2019s affidavit related that the defendant was held on bail throughout the case and wished to be released from custody as quickly as possible. He decided to accept the Commonwealth\u2019s plea offer because he wanted to be released. On the day the defendant pleaded guilty, he did so with knowledge that the victim had not appeared.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">2. <em>The new trial motion. </em>The hearing on the defendant\u2019s motion for new trial addressed both the intelligence and the voluntariness of the plea. In a subsequent written decision, the motion judge (who was not the plea judge) rejected the defendant\u2019s claim that coercion and duress rendered the plea involuntary. The motion judge concluded, however, that the record of the guilty plea colloquy did not establish that the defendant\u2019s plea was intelligent. He allowed the defendant\u2019s motion on that ground and ordered a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-7\">The motion judge erred. The Commonwealth\u2019s factual presentation at the guilty plea hearing, and the defendant\u2019s acknowledgment that he committed the acts alleged, constituted the requisite admission \u201cto facts constituting the unexplained element\u201d to render the plea intelligent. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McGuirk, </em>376 Mass. 338, 344 (1978), cert. denied, 439 U.S. 1120 (1979). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Correa, 43 Mass. App. Ct. 714, <em>717 </em>(1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b827-8\">a. <em>Raising the issue of the intelligence and voluntariness of a guilty plea. </em>Under the terms of Mass.R.Crim.P. 30(c)(2) and (3), as appearing in 435 Mass. 1501 (2001), a motion for a new trial must specify the grounds for the relief claimed, and as the moving party, the defendant must, where appropriate, accompany the motion with an affidavit or affidavits in support of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>position. Whether an affidavit must accompany a new trial motion that relies solely on the contemporaneous record of the guilty plea proceeding has not been explicitly decided previously. We conclude that the rule does not impose such a requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">Ordinarily, if the defendant wishes to present evidence in support of the grounds raised in his motion for new trial, he must submit an affidavit to support his contention. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DeMarco, </em>387 Mass. 481, 485 n.10 (1982); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saarela, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 403, 407 (1983). However, \u201c[a]s explained in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Foster, </em>368 Mass. 100, 108 nn.6 &amp; 7 (1975), a defendant attacking a conviction based upon a guilty plea has a choice between two tactics. He may stand on the contemporaneous record, the record made in the case through the stage of the colloquy and conviction. If the defendant chooses this route, it is not open to the Commonwealth to introduce extraneous evidence tending to show that the defendant in fact acted freely and intelligently in tendering the plea. . . . Alternatively, the defendant may offer extraneous evidence to supplement (or contradict) the record, but in that event the Commonwealth has a like right to offer evidence.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nolan, </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 491, 492 (1985) (citation omitted). \u201cWhen a defendant has received a constitutionally inadequate plea colloquy, he is entitled to withdraw that plea.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Colon, </em>439 Mass. 519, 529 (2003). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Foster, </em>368 Mass. at 102. Consequently, a defendant who challenges the intelligence or voluntariness of his plea and relies solely on the contemporaneous record of the proceeding for that challenge need do no more than file with his motion a copy of the record of the plea proceeding being challenged. The record will then establish the constitutional adequacy or inadequacy of the colloquy.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-6\">b. <em>Intelligence of the plea. </em>Here, the defendant\u2019s challenge to the intelligence of his plea rested solely on the contemporaneous record of the plea proceeding.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In such circumstances, the question is wholly a matter of law. We consider, then, the cor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>rectness of the motion judge\u2019s determination that the defendant\u2019s guilty plea was not intelligent.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">The intelligence of the defendant\u2019s plea hinges entirely on the third basis for intelligence: the defendant\u2019s admission to facts recited during the colloquy. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Correa, </em>43 Mass. App. Ct. at 717 (intelligence requirement can be satisfied by judge explaining elements of crime to defendant; counsel\u2019s representation that he has explained to defendant elements he admits by his plea; or defendant\u2019s stated admission to facts that constitute unexplained elements). The colloquy does not contain an explanation by the plea judge of the elements of rape or a representation by the defendant\u2019s attorney that she explained to the defendant the elements he admitted by his plea. Thus, we turn to the prosecutor\u2019s factual recitation and the defendant\u2019s acknowledgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">The prosecutor stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b829-7\">\u201cOn or about October 27th of last year, 1992, at 3:40 a.m., two Fairhaven police officers responded to the Riverside Cemetery, having received calls from residents in the area with respect to screaming emanating from the cemetery. Upon arrival at the cemetery, they observed a young woman later identified as [the victim] running from the cemetery area. She was naked from the waist down and had an article of clothing, a yellow T-Shirt, tied around her neck.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b830-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>\u201cBased on information received from the victim and further investigation, specifically information received with regard to a vehicle that [the victim] had gone to the cemetery in, the defendant was located, and clothing that he was wearing was consistent with that described by the victim .... She subsequently identified him as the person who picked her up on the morning of October 27th. He took her to the cemetery and forcibly raped her when she declined to have sex with him voluntarily in exchange for United States currency.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">After this factual recitation, the plea judge asked the defendant, \u201cIs that true?\u201d and the defendant responded, \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b830-6\">Here, the prosecutor\u2019s factual recitation and the defendant\u2019s acknowledgment that he committed the acts detailed therein were sufficient to constitute an admission to the \u201cunexplained elements\u201d and establish that the defendant\u2019s plea to rape was intelligent. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Colantoni, </em>396 Mass. 672, 678-679 (1986); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bowler, </em>60 Mass. App. Ct. 209, 210-211 (2003). The rape statute follows the common-law definition of rape and requires the Commonwealth to prove that the defendant (1) had sexual intercourse, (2) by force or threat of force against the will of the victim. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>433 Mass. 722, 726-727 (2001). By any reasonable measure, the defendant\u2019s admission that he raped the victim when she refused to have sex with him voluntarily establishes this proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-7\">We find unpersuasive the contention that without a more detailed recitation of what constitutes rape in legal terms, or of the particulars of the defendant\u2019s acts, his admission to the prosecutor\u2019s factual recitation was insufficient and renders his plea unintelligent. Such an argument rests on the strained premise that the prosecutor\u2019s recitation that the defendant \u201cforcibly raped\u201d the victim, without further explication of details, is an inadequate basis to establish the defendant\u2019s admission to the unexplained elements of the crime because the defendant may have mistakenly pleaded guilty to rape when he only performed acts that could not amount to rape in a legal sense, such as touching the victim on the breast.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b831-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>We reject such a hypertechnical parsing as it ignores both the context of the defendant\u2019s plea and the lay understanding of \u201crape.\u201d The defendant\u2019s plea was part of a proceeding in which he pleaded guilty to a crime both defined by statute<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and set forth in the numbered indictment, to which the defendant pleaded guilty, as \u201csexual intercourse or unnatural sexual intercourse with [the victim] ... by force and against her will.\u201d At the time of his plea, the defendant was twenty-five years old, with an eleventh grade education, and there is no suggestion that he lacked competence. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Robbins, </em>431 Mass. 442, 445 (2000) (test of competence to plead guilty similar to that for standing trial); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Conaghan, </em>433 Mass. 105, 110 (2000). Rape is a term commonly understood by lay persons. The term has long been part of common parlance, and of the common law, descriptive of involuntary sexual intercourse. The lay meaning of \u201crape\u201d is well understood as encompassing, at the very least, unconsented-to natural sexual intercourse, \u201cthe penetration of the female sex organ by the male sex organ with or without emission.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gallant, </em>373 Mass. 577, 584 (1977). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brattman, </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. 579, 583 (1980). Indeed, in common understanding and practice, the term is well understood to encompass unnatural sexual intercourse as well. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gallant, supra </em>at 589-590.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-4\">The defendant\u2019s admission that he \u201cforcibly raped\u201d the victim clearly constitutes an acknowledgment that he had forcible sexual intercourse with the victim, who was \u201cnaked from the waist down,\u201d when she refused to have sex with him voluntarily in exchange for money. That the defendant may not have been aware of all possible legal permutations of rape is irrelevant. So too is the failure of the prosecutor to describe in minute detail the defendant\u2019s forcible penetration of the victim. In the context of his guilty plea, the defendant\u2019s admission that he forcibly raped the victim when she would not voluntarily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>have sex with him for money was self-explanatory. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wiswall, </em>43 Mass. App. Ct. 722, 723 (1997) (left unadorned, term is not vague or ambiguous); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DeCologero, </em>49 Mass. App. Ct. 93, 97 (2000) (in prosecution for trafficking cocaine, use of term \u201cmarketing\u201d tended to make charge \u201cself-explanatory\u201d). Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pixley, </em>48 Mass. App. Ct. 917, 918 (2000) (no admission to facts where prosecutor\u2019s recitation was made outside presence of defendant); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>60 Mass. App. Ct. 88, 91 (2003) (no facts recited by prosecutor or admitted by defendant).</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">After the plea judge accepted the defendant\u2019s plea and imposed sentence, in the defendant\u2019s presence the prosecutor offered additional facts to explain the Commonwealth\u2019s favorable plea bargain offer to the defendant.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Because the prosecutor\u2019s initial factual recitation and the defendant\u2019s admission alone provided a sufficient factual basis to render the defendant\u2019s plea intelligent, we need not address whether the subsequent recitation also formed part of the contemporaneous record that could be relied upon to establish the intelligent nature of. the defendant\u2019s guilty plea. See <em>Huot </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>363 Mass. 91 (1973); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Quinones, </em>414 Mass. 423, 432 (1993) (\u201ccontemporaneous record\u201d includes not only proceedings on acceptance of plea, but record of trial preceding plea); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nolan, </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. at 492 (contemporaneous record includes record through stage of colloquy and conviction).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b832-6\">There is no merit to the defendant\u2019s contention that a new trial is warranted because the plea judge erroneously advised the defendant of the maximum sentence for aggravated rape (life in prison) rather than that for the lesser included offense of rape to which the defendant was pleading guilty (twenty years <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>in State prison). See Mass.R.Crim.P. 12(c)(3)(B), 378 Mass. 868 (1979) (requiring judge to advise defendant, \u201cwhere appropriate, of the maximum possible sentence . . . and of the mandatory minimum sentence, if any\u201d). \u201cA slip in the protocol prescribed by rule 12 does not entitle a defendant to withdraw a guilty plea if it \u2018did not significantly affect the substance of the particular requirement\u2019 \u201d (footnote omitted). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Glines, </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. 95, 99 (1996), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nolan, </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. at 496. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clerico, </em>35 Mass. App. Ct. 407, 413 (1993). In these circumstances, such a misstatement is not the type that warrants the determination that justice was not done and that a new trial is warranted. Indeed, the favorable sentencing consequences of the defendant\u2019s plea bargain render insignificant any deviation. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hiskin, ante </em>633, 642 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">The order allowing the defendant\u2019s motion for new trial is reversed, and a new order shall enter denying the defendant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b826-7\">Because the offense occurred prior to the Truth in Sentencing Act, St. 1993, c. 432, the judge could permissibly impose a split sentence to State prison. The indictment charging assault was placed on file with the defendant\u2019s consent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b826-8\">Apart from his attack on the validity of the underlying guilty plea, the defendant does not challenge the finding of violation and revocation of his probation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b826-9\">The defendant\u2019s affidavit addressed only the claim of coercion. His affidavit did not assert that he did not commit the acts alleged by the prosecutor. Nor did it assert that he did not know what \u201crape\u201d was or that he lacked understanding as to the nature of the charge or the consequences of his plea.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b828-7\">In contrast, the defendant\u2019s voluntariness challenge introduced extraneous evidence, his affidavit, to establish coercion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b829-8\">The defendant does not challenge the denial of his motion insofar as it claimed lack of voluntariness due to coercion or duress. In any event, we discern no error. The motion judge found the assertions of the defendant\u2019s affidavit not credible. These assertions directly contradicted his responses to the plea judge\u2019s questions made while under oath. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hiskin, ante </em>633, 634 (2007) (defendant\u2019s sworn statements at colloquy have special significance when in contradiction of later averments). The defendant\u2019s assertions were contradicted, as well, by his trial attorney\u2019s affidavit, and were not supported by affidavits of other witnesses or other objective indicia.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-9\">There is also no merit to the claim that coercion arose from the plea judge\u2019s failure to pose a direct question to the defendant inquiring whether his plea was coerced. The plea judge did ask, \u201cHas anyone induced you to plead guilty by way or promises or offers of any kind?\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nolan, </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. at 502 (no formula should be followed mechanically, as it would interfere with probing exchange). \u201cNo particular form of words need be used in the required inquiry of a defendant.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Quinones, </em>414 Mass. 423, 434 (1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b830-8\">As noted, the defendant\u2019s affidavit makes no such claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b831-5\">General Laws c. 265, \u00a7 <em>22(b), </em>as appearing in St. 1980, c. 459, \u00a7 6, provides, in pertinent part: \u201cWhoever has sexual intercourse or unnatural sexual intercourse with a person, and compels such person to submit by force and against his will, or compels such person to submit by threat of bodily injury . . . shall be punished . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b832-7\">In summary, the prosecutor related that at the time of the offense, the victim was working as a prostitute. Despite substantial efforts to locate her, the Commonwealth had been unable to do so in part because she is a heroin addict and unstable as a result. She had been convicted in the past for various offenses that could have been used to impeach her credibility at trial, and was at that time subject to prosecution in Bristol County.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b832-8\">Likewise, this recitation refutes the defendant\u2019s claim of attorney coercion by establishing on the record of the proceeding that the defendant went forward with his plea knowing that the victim had not appeared.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b833-7\">Trainor, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AEk\">(dissenting). I respectfully dissent for two reasons. First, because a motion for a new trial is the appropriate avenue for attacking the validity of a guilty plea, it is a matter for the \u201csound discretion of the trial judge, and . . . will not be reversed unless it is manifestly unjust, or unless the [proceeding] was infected with prejudicial constitutional error.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Colon, </em>439 Mass. 519, 524 (2003), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Russin, </em>420 Mass. 309, 318 (1995). It is inappropriate for a reviewing court to substitute its own judgment for that of the motion judge when the decision of the motion judge, as it is here, is neither manifestly unjust nor infected with prejudicial constitutional error.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-9\">Second, I agree with the motion judge that the prosecutor\u2019s recitation of the facts failed to include all of the elements of the offense of rape, and, therefore, the defendant did not intelligently make his plea as he did not have knowledge of the elements of the charge against him. See Mass.R.Crim.P. 12(c)(5)(A), 378 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>Mass. 869 (1979). The defendant must receive \u201creal notice of the true nature\u201d of the charge to which he intends to plead guilty. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>385 Mass. 497, 509 (1982). This requirement is satisfied when the record shows (1) that the judge explained \u201cto the defendant the elements of the crime; [or] (2) by counsel\u2019s representation that she has explained to the defendant the elements he admits by his plea; or, (3) by the defendant\u2019s stated admission to facts recited during the colloquy which constitute the unexplained elements.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Correa, </em>43 Mass. App. Ct. 714, 717 (1997). These requirements should occur generally contemporaneously to the plea hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">Here, the transcript of the colloquy evidences that neither the plea judge nor counsel explained to the defendant the elements of the charge to which he admitted by his plea.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court proposes that the third prong of the test for an intelligent plea is satisfied because the defendant can be presumed to have understood the elements of rape through the prosecutor\u2019s recitation of the following facts: \u201cUpon arrival at the cemetery, [the police officers] observed a young woman later identified as [the alleged victim] running from the cemetery area. She was naked from the waist down and had an article of clothing, a yellow T-shirt, tied around her neck. . . . She subsequently identified [the defendant] as the person who picked her up on the morning of October 27th. He took her to the cemetery and forcibly raped her when she declined to have sex with him voluntarily in exchange for United States currency.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b834-6\">The Commonwealth argues that the commonly accepted lay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>person\u2019s definition of \u201crape\u201d is forced penile-vaginal penetration. The defendant, then a twenty-five year old man with an eleventh grade education, presumably knew and understood this definition to the exclusion of all other possible definitions. The court apparently adopts this argument when it states that \u201c[t]he rape statute follows the common-law definition of rape and requires the Commonwealth to prove that the defendant (1) had sexual intercourse, (2) by force or threat of force against the will of the victim.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 802. The court believes that this common-law definition of \u201crape\u201d is well understood by the average lay person, and also believes that the definition of unnatural sexual intercourse is equally well understood by the average lay person. The defendant therefore, according to the court, admitted that he raped (presumably by penile-vaginal penetration) the victim when she declined to have sex (again, presumably by penile-vaginal penetration) with him voluntarily in exchange for a fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">The problem is that the record is devoid of any indication that the Commonwealth was alleging penile-vaginal penetration during either the alleged rape or the sex for a fee. This line of reasoning is pure conjecture with no basis in the record before us, and the circumstances of this case do not lend themselves comfortably to this degree of speculation. A potential client transported a prostitute to a cemetery in the early morning hours, and for some reason that we are not aware of, the business negotiation went sour. We do not know how or when the victim\u2019s clothes were removed, nor do we have any idea what transpired before the victim ran out of the cemetery. All we have for the purposes of the defendant\u2019s plea is the prosecutor\u2019s representation that the victim was \u201cforcibly raped.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">Massachusetts law has defined \u201crape\u201d as encompassing much more than the lay person\u2019s definition of forced penile-vaginal penetration. The applicable statute defines rape as \u201csexual intercourse or unnatural sexual intercourse with a person, and compel[ling] such person to submit by force and against his will, or compel[ling] such person to submit by threat of bodily injury . . . .\u201d G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 22, as appearing in St. 1980, c. 459, \u00a7 6. The Supreme Judicial Court has interpreted the statutory language to include not only the common-law notion of rape but also the \u201cpenetration of the female sex organ by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>male sex organ, with or without emission,\u201d as well as \u201cunnatural sexual intercourse\u201d to include \u201coral and anal intercourse, including fellatio, cunnilingus, and other intrusions of a part of a person\u2019s body or other object into the genital or anal opening of another person\u2019s body.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gallant, </em>373 Mass. 577, 584 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brattman, </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. 579, 583 (1980), this court determined that a jury\u2019s \u201cnormal common sense view of rape\u201d was not sufficient to cure an erroneous instruction on the elements of rape. The court further observed that \u201cit can be concluded that, in general, acts which do not involve penetration of a genital or anal opening or penetration by a sexual organ, however distasteful and frightening to an unwilling partner, do not fall within the meaning of rape.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 584. The court determined that, on the facts of that case, the erroneous instructions could only be limited and potentially cured by the jury hearing detailed evidence of the defendant\u2019s particular acts. <em>Id. </em>at 584-585. Relying on <em>Brattman, </em>the motion judge in the present case accurately determined that the defendant had not made an intelligent plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">Further, this court has consistently rejected the concept of a lay person\u2019s understanding of the elements of a crime. We have credited a defendant with an understanding of an element of a crime when that element has been made \u201cself-explanatory.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wiswall, </em>43 Mass. App. Ct. 722, 723 (1997). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DeCologero, </em>49 Mass. App. Ct. 93, 97 (2000). We have not, however, considered an element of a crime to be self-explanatory based upon a lay person\u2019s general understanding. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pixley, </em>48 Mass. App. Ct. 917, 918 (2000) (vacating \u201cpossession of cocaine with intent to distribute\u201d conviction because charge was not \u201cself-explanatory\u201d in that neither judge nor counsel explained elements of charge, and no narrative constituting elements of crime was read to defendant to which he could have admitted); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Andrews, </em>49 Mass. App. Ct. 201, 203-205 (2000) (holding recitation of facts ambiguous and insufficient to inform defendant of elements of \u201cpossession of Class B controlled substance with intent to distribute\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>60 Mass. App. Ct. 88, 91-92 (2003). For instance, in <em>Com</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number><em>monwealth </em>v. <em>Jones, supra, </em>we held that neither \u201cassault and battery\u201d nor \u201cintimidation of a witness\u201d are self-explanatory. A defendant cannot be \u201cpresumed to understand their elements simply by virtue of their designation. While the phrase \u2018assault and battery\u2019 may have entered common parlance, this does not mean that the specific elements of the offense are readily apparent from the phrase itself. This is even more the case with respect to \u2018intimidation of a witness.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 91. Further, in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barry, </em>51 Mass. App. Ct. 9 (2001), where the defendant heard and agreed to the names of the charges and then stipulated to unstated facts, this court held, analogizing the \u201cvice\u201d to that in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Correa, supra, </em>that \u201cthe judge \u2018failed to ascertain that [the defendant] had knowledge of the elements of the charges against him .... Nothing more need be shown to establish the inadequacy of the colloquy for constitutional purposes.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barry, supra </em>at 10-11, quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Correa, </em>43 Mass. App. Ct. at 719. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hilaire, </em>51 Mass. App. Ct. 818, 826 (2001) (Brown, J., concurring), <em>S.C., </em>437 Mass. 809 (2002) (\u201cthe simple, unadorned stating of these charges [of larceny of a motor vehicle and operating after suspension] was not clear or specific enough adequately to inform the defendant of the elements of the charged crimes\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">The only instance where the charge becomes self-explanatory is when the defendant is fully informed of all of the elements through an unambiguous recitation of facts. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DeCologero, </em>49 Mass. App. Ct. at 97, the court determined that \u201ctrafficking in cocaine\u201d became self-explanatory because the prosecutor recited a lengthy narrative of facts that encompassed all the elements of the charge, and the judge used the term \u201cmarketing\u201d and stated the amount of cocaine that the Commonwealth was required to prove. Also, in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wiswall, </em>43 Mass. App. Ct. at 723, \u201cassault with intent to kill\u201d was considered self-explanatory only after the defendant had \u201cacknowledged that, during an extended police chase, he was driving a stolen car, saw Officer Collier in the roadway ahead of him, and \u2018changed lanes and tried to run Collier over.\u2019 \u201d The court determined that the defendant acknowledged the missing element of intent when he admitted that he \u201ctried to run Collier over.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b838-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>In the present case, however, the prosecutor\u2019s recitation of the facts failed to include all the elements of the offense of rape. Even though the term \u201crape\u201d is commonly known and used by lay persons, it does not mean that the legal elements of that offense were known by the defendant. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DelVerde, </em>398 Mass. 288, 297 (1986) (\u201ca court may not convict unless there are sufficient facts on the record to establish each element of the offense\u201d). Indicating only that the defendant agreed that he did something \u201cforcibly\u201d to the victim, the record does not establish that the defendant knew what that \u201csomething\u201d was. Just because the defendant may have assumed a lay person\u2019s definition of \u201crape\u201d as forced penile-vaginal intercourse does not preclude the possibility that he may have believed that acts other than forced penile-vaginal intercourse constituted rape. Although, as the court points out, the defendant need not \u201chave been aware of all possible legal permutations of rape,\u201d the record must contain sufficient facts to establish each element of the offense and cannot rely on a lay person\u2019s definition to fill in the gaps.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">Under an <em>Alford </em>plea, a defendant who professes his innocence may nevertheless enter a plea of guilty and \u201c \u2018voluntarily, knowingly and understanding^ consent to the imposition of a prison sentence,\u2019 if the State can demonstrate a \u2018strong factual basis\u2019 for the plea. <em>[North Carolina </em>v.] <em>Alford, </em>[400 U.S. 25,] 37-38 [(1970)]. Whether the defendant admits to the crime in open court, or the Commonwealth shows the factual basis for the plea, a court <em>may not </em>convict unless there are <em>sufficient facts on the record </em>to establish <em>each element </em>of the offense\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DelVerde, </em>398 Mass. at 297. This is precisely the issue before us, because even though the prosecutor demonstrated a factual basis for the plea, he failed to enter any facts in evidence that would establish each element of the offense. This requirement should not be considered \u201chypertechnical parsing.\u201d We do not ask prosecutors to recite the factual basis of the alleged crime in \u201cminute detail,\u201d but we do require sufficient detail that a reviewing court can determine if a plea was intelligently made. A plea is intelligently made only when the defendant can admit to facts entered on the record that establish each element of the crime with which he is charged. We are left here, for the first time in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>this Commonwealth, with the principle that the simple designation of a crime, and nothing more, is sufficient notice of both the nature and specific elements of the charge a defendant faces.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b834-7\">At the time of the plea hearing, the defendant had been incarcerated since the day of his arrest, and his primary concern was being released from jail. The affidavits of the defendant and his defense attorney contradict whether the defendant was aware that the victim was not present for the hearing. At the same time, the prosecution was aware of its \u201csporadic contact\u201d with the victim and the victim\u2019s history of heroin addiction, prostitution, prior convictions that could be used to impeach her credibility at trial, and pending prosecutions. Her cooperation at any future proceedings, from the prosecutor\u2019s perspective, was certainly in doubt. This \u201cperfect storm\u201d of mutual interests resulted in the defendant tendering a guilty plea and being released from jail that same day.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b834-8\">The court seems to imply that the indictment was read at the plea hearing. The reading of the indictment occurred four months earlier at the arraignment. The transcript of the plea hearing does not indicate that the admittedly descriptive nature of the indictment was read at that time.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
