The pre-sentence report recommended a 16-level increase in Valenzuela\u2019s base offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) due to his prior Florida convictions for DUI/ manslaughter and DUI/bodily injury. Valenzuela objected, arguing that his prior convictions were not crimes of violence under the guidelines. The district court, based on the panel decision in <em>United States v. Vargas-Duran, </em>319 F.3d 194 (5th Cir.2003) <em>(Vargas-Duran </em>I), overruled his objection and sentenced him to 87 months of imprisonment and three years of supervised release. He timely appealed. Informed by the subsequent en banc decision in <em>United States v. Vargas-Duran, </em>356 F.3d 598 (5th Cir.2004) <em>(Vargas-Duran II), </em>and by an even more recent decision of this court, <em>United States v. Dominguez-Ochoa, </em>386 F.3d 639 (5th Cir.2004), we vacate the sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1327-26\">Valenzuela contends that his offenses were not \u201ccrimes of violence\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) because, as defined by Florida law, they neither (a) require the intentional use of force, nor (b) qualify as an enumerated offense under the Guidelines\u2019 definition of a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d found in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, cmt. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1306\">*1306</page-number>n. l(B)(ii)(II) (2002). This court\u2019s en banc decision in <em>Vargas-Duran II </em>settles the first contention in Valenzuela\u2019s favor in this circuit. Applying the \u201ccategorical approach\u201d of <em>Vargas-Duran II </em>and its successor en banc case, <em>United States v. Calderon-Pe\u00f1a, </em>383 F.3d 254 (5th Cir.2004), we must conclude that the Florida DUI/bodily injury and DUI/manslaughter statutes under which Valenzuela was convicted do not require the intentional use of force. <em>See </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7 316.193(3)(o)(2) and (3). Subsection (c)(2) provides that if a defendant drives under the influence of alcohol and causes \u201cserious bodily injury\u201d to another, he is guilty of a third-degree felony. Subsection (c)(3) criminalizes as DUI/manslaughter, a second-degree felony, a drunken defendant\u2019s causing the death of another person. No mens rea of intent is required under these provisions. The Eleventh Circuit has, it is true, held that the subsection (c)(2) offense is a crime of violence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(a), <em>see Le v. United States Attorney General, </em>196 F.3d 1352 (11th Cir.1999), but we are bound by <em>Vargas-Duran II </em>and <em>Calderon-Pe\u00f1a. </em>Moreover, the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s interpretation will be reviewed by the Supreme Court in <em>Leocal v. Ashcroft, </em>No. 03-583, 2004 WL 2384248 (2004), argued Oct. 12, 2004. <em>See Leocal v. Ashcroft, </em>540 U.S. 1176, 124 S.Ct. 1405, 158 L.Ed.2d 76 (2004) (granting certiorari to the unreported Eleventh Circuit decision).</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-4\">Valenzuela\u2019s convictions also fail to qualify as enumerated, generic manslaughter offenses for purposes of \u00a7 2L1.2. This court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Dominguez-Ochoa </em>so held in regard to a substantially similar Texas statute criminalizing negligent manslaughter. <em>See </em>386 F.3d at 646-47, 2004 WL 2101986, at *8.</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-7\">Only if the Supreme Court affirms the Eleventh Circuit in <em>Leocal </em>in such a way as to undermine this court\u2019s authorities would Valenzuela\u2019s sentence be upheld. The prudent course is for this court to act upon our currently established precedents and allow the government, or the district court on remand, to take the next step.</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-8\">VACATED and REMANDED for re-sentencing.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
